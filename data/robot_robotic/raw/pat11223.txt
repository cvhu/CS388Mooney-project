A two-axis optical wrist which can be used in combination with an industrial manipulator having associated therewith a laser beam delivery system. The two-axis optical wrist for laser application provides two additional degrees of freedom which in combination with a three-axis industrial manipulator provides the five degrees of freedom necessary for industrial material processing laser systems to position a laser beam anywhere within the work envelope of an industrial manipulator.
Claims We claim: 1. A two-axis optical wrist comprising: (A) a mounting bracket having an aperture therethrough including means for removably securing said mounting bracket to the terminal end of a laser beam delivery system and through which aperture the beam passes; (B) a first and a second mirror housing, each mirror housing having a first mounting face with an aperture therethrough and a second mounting face with an aperture therethrough perpendicular to said first mounting face, and defining therein a chamber in open communication through said first and second mounting face apertures and a reflective surface disposed within said chamber; (C) a first and a second motor means each having an inner stator, an outer stator and an annular rotor which is coaxially positioned between the inner and outer stators about an axis of revolution, which axis of revolution is coincident with the beam being conveyed therethrough; (a) said first motor means defining a conduit through which the beam passes the inner and outer stator means being in a mechanically fixed association with said mounting bracket and the rotor means being in a mechanically fixed relationship with said first mirror housing first mounting face, (b) said second motor means defining a conduit through which the beam passes, the inner and outer stator being in a mechanically fixed association with said first mirror housing second face and the rotor being in a fixed mechanical association with the second mirror housing first mounting face; (D) a laser beam focussing assembly removably mounted on the second mirror housing second face; wherein rotation of either motor means about its axis of motion causes the beam reflected by the reflective surface of the mirror housing associated with the rotor thereof passes at an angle of 90.degree. to the originating beam and describes a generally flat surface to which the axis of rotation of the motor means is perpendicular. 2. In combination with a robotic system including an integral laser beam delivery system, said robotic system having one or more mechanical joints defining at least in part a first axis of motion and a second axis of motion, which axes of motion define a contoured path through the robotic system's geometric range of motion, wherein each of said mechanical joints defines in part a frame member; an integral laser beam delivery system for the delivery of a beam along any point within said geometric range of motion comprising: an optical joint having a housing with a reflective surface disposed therein mounted on the frame member of each said mechanical joint so as to be in synchronous association with each said mechanical joint; a tubular member disposed between adjacent optical joints and through which tubular member the beam passes as it travels from optical joint to optical joint, Said tubular member being attached between the frame members of each mechanical joint with which said adjacent optical joint is in synchronous association, wherein said reflective surface establishes a constant geometric relation between a segment of the beam impinging on said reflective surface and the axis of motion associated with said mechanical joint whereby the optical joints along with the tubular members disposed therebetween in each axis of motion are synchronous and incapable of mutual interference; the improvement comprising: a two-axis optical wrist comprising: (A) a mounting bracket having an aperture therethrough including means for removably securing said mounting bracket to the terminal end of a laser beam delivery system and through which aperture the beam passes; (B) a first and a second mirror housing, each mirror housing having a first mounting face with an aperture therethrough and a second mounting face with an aperture therethrough perpendicular to said first mounting face, and defining therein a chamber in open communication through said first and second mounting face apertures and a reflective surface disposed within said chamber; (C) a first and a second motor means each having an inner stator, an outer stator and an annular rotor which is coaxially positioned between the inner and outer stators about an axis of revolution, which axis of revolution is coincident with the beam being conveyed therethrough; (a) said first motor means defining a conduit through which the beam passes the inner and outer stator means being in a mechanically fixed association with said mounting bracket and the rotor means being in a mechanically fixed relationship with said first mirror housing first mounting face, (b) said second motor means defining a conduit through which the beam passes, the inner and outer stator being in a mechanically fixed association with said first mirror housing second face and the rotor being in a fixed mechanical association with the second mirror housing first mounting face; (D) a laser beam focussing assembly removably mounted on the second mirror housing second face; wherein rotation of either motor means about its axis of motion causes the beam reflected by the reflective surface of the mirror housing associated with the rotor thereof passes at an angle of 90.degree. to the originating beam and describes a generally flat surface to which the axis of rotation of the motor means is perpendicular.
