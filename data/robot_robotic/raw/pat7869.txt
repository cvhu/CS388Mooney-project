Preforms are produced by injection molding in an injection molding machine, allowing enough pre-cooling time within the mold to create a temporary rigid skin on the preforms, and transporting the preforms to a separate cooling device. In the preferred embodiment, the step of transporting the preforms to a separate cooling device includes the steps of removing the preforms into a carrier mounted as an end-of-arm tool on a robot, the carrier having a plurality of orifices to receive the preforms, and using the robot to transport the carrier and the preforms to a cooling device interface. The cooling device interface has a plurality of hoses connected thereto for pneumatically transporting the preforms from the carrier to the cooling device. The preferred apparatus thus includes a robot, and an end-of-arm tool for the robot having a plurality of orifices alignable with mold cavities in the injection molding machine once the mold halves are opened. The orifices receive the preforms once cooled sufficiently in the mold to create a temporary rigid skin. A separate preform cooling device is configured to receive preforms from the orifices when the end-of-arm tool is transported to the cooling device by the robot. Preferably, there is an interface unit having a plate with a plurality of openings alignable with the orifices and having a plurality of hoses connected one to each opening to pneumatically transport the preforms from the orifices, through the openings and the tubes, to cooling tubes in the cooling device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Apparatus for production of preforms for plastic containers, comprising an injection molding machine for injection molding of said preforms, a robot, an end-of-arm tool for said robot having a plurality of orifices alignable with mold cavities in said injection molding machine once mold halves thereof are opened, to receive said preforms once cooled sufficiently in said mold to create a temporary rigid skin on said preforms, and a separate preform cooling device configured to receive preforms from said orifices when said end-of-arm tool is transported to said cooling device by said robot, where said preforms are received from said orifices via an interface unit, said interface unit comprising a plate having a plurality of openings alignable with said orifices and having a plurality of hoses connected one to each said opening to pneumatically transport said preforms from said orifices, through said openings and said tubes, to cooling tubes in said cooling device.
