A method and an industrial robotic device for uniformly applying coatings at appropriate thickness and pitch upon a surface moves a spray applicator foam dispenser between two parallel tracks. The uniform application of foam at each pass is assured, by accelerating the speed of the foam dispenser at the end of each pass, by providing respective curved uphill distal ends of the tracks, so that the spray applicator foam dispenser moves up the curved distal ends and returns quickly while changing speed tilt and direction at the end of each pass.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of applying a spray-applied foam substance layer upon a structural surface, comprising the steps of: continuously applying said foam substance in liquid form in adjacent axially extending bands of said liquid foam substance to form a coating of a resultant solid layer of said substance, from a spray applicator source moving on a track in alternate directions transverse to an axially extending direction of each band, each said band having a predetermined width and axially extending length; subjecting said spray applicator source to an arcuate uphill movement by the bending of said track away from said surface at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said spray applicator source, wherein said transverse movement of said spray applicator source accelerates in speed along said track; said spray application source being tilted outward by said track as said spray applicator source moves uphill, thereby reducing the amount of said substance in liquid form being applied to the respective edge portions of each said band upon the structural surface. 2. A method of applying a solid roofing polyurethane foam coating upon a structural surface, comprising the steps of: continuously applying said polyurethane foam in liquid form in adjacent axially extending bands of said polyurethane foam a coating of a resultant solid foam layer upon said roof, from a foam applicator source moving on a track in alternate directions transverse to an axially extending direction of each band of said bands of said foam, each said band having a predetermined width and axial length; subjecting said applicator source to an arcuate uphill movement by the bending of said track at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said applicator source; of liquid foam, wherein said transverse movement of said foam applicator source of liquid foam accelerates in speed, said foam applicator source being tilted outwardly by said track as said foam applicator source moves arcuately uphill on said track, thereby reducing the amount of said polyurethane foam being applied to said respective edge portions of each said band of foam upon the roof at an end of each pass of said liquid foam applicator source across each said axially extending band of foam. 3. The method as in claim 2 wherein said foam applicator source is a nozzle. 4. The method as in claim 2 wherein a radially extending swinging arm with a telescoping slide mechanism provides transverse movement of said foam applicator source along said at least one track, so that said foam applicator source moves linearly as said swinging arm pivots about a pivot fulcrum point. 5. The method as in claim 4 further comprising the steps of controlling the thickness of said liquid foam upon said structural surface by varying a rate of flow of discharge of said liquid foam emanating from said foam applicator source. 6. The method as in claim 4 further comprising the step of applying said polyurethane foam upon a slope of a drain on the portion of said resultant solid foam layer of said structural surface by reducing ground movement speed of said foam applicator source on successive passes away and parallel to a drainage line of said drain, resulting in a stepwise slope approximating a predetermined contour of said drain. 7. The method as in claim 2 further comprising the step of tilting said foam applicator source a predetermined amount cyclically as said foam applicator source moves transversely along said track, thereby minimizing variation in foam thickness in the form of rounded ridges due to a hollow-cone pattern of the application of said liquid foam from said foam applicator source. 8. The method as in claim 2 further comprising the step of applying a layer of fabric from a fabric roll to said layer of liquid foam, thereby reinforcing said solid foam layer with said fabric layer, whereby during solidification of said liquid foam, said fabric layer becomes imbedded in said resultant solid foam layer. 9. The method as in claim 2 further comprising the step of applying an elastomeric sheet covering over said liquid foam layer, thereby forming a coating skin over said resultant solid foam layer. 10. A method of applying a spray-applied foam substance layer upon a structural surface, comprising the steps of: continuously applying said foam substance in liquid form in adjacent linearly extending bands from a spray applicator source comprising means for varying the distance between said spray applicator source and a target surface, said spray applicator source moving on a track in alternate directions transverse to an axial direction of each band, each said band having a predetermined width and axial length; and wherein said means for varying the distance between said spray applicator source and a target surface comprises subjecting said spray applicator source to an arcuate uphill movement by the bending of said track away form said surface at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said spray applicator source, wherein said transverse movement of said spray applicator source accelerates in speed along said track; tilting said spray application source being tilted outward by said track as said spray applicator source moves uphill, thereby reducing the amount of said substance in liquid form being applied to the edge portions of each said band upon the structural surface. 11. A method of applying a solid roofing polyurethane foam layer upon a structural surface comprising the steps of: continuously applying said substance in liquid form in adjacent linearly extending bands from a spray applicator source comprising means for varying the distance between said spray applicator source and a roof target surface, said spray applicator source moving on a track in alternate directions transverse to an axial direction of each band, each said band having a predetermined width and axial length; and wherein said means for varying the distance between said spray applicator source and a roof target surface comprises subjecting said applicator source to an uphill movement by the bending of said track away from said surface at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said applicator source; wherein said transverse movement of said spray applicator source accelerates in speed along said track; said foam applicator source being tilted outwardly by said track as said foam applicator source moves uphill on said track, thereby reducing the amount of said liquid foam being applied to said respective edge portions of each said band of foam upon the roof at an end of each pass of said liquid foam applicator source across each said linearly extending band of foam.
