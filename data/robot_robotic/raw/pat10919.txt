Improved robotic fingers are disclosed. The present invention provides a novel three joint, two actuator robotic finger. The finger disclosed is self-contained, lighter and requires less computational overhead than designs requiring one actuator for each joint, while providing greater versatility than simple grippers. The fingers of the present invention are constructed using a series of pulleys and tendons to couple the motion of two joints. In a preferred embodiment, a novel tendon configuration is disclosed which provides human-like enclosure and grasping capabilities. Also, other useful tendon configurations are disclosed. Robotic hands comprised of a group of one or more of the fingers of the present invention and methods of utilizing them to manipulate objects are also disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mechanical finger comprising: (a) support means; (b) an articulated member extending from the support means comprising: (i) three sets of connecting segments; (ii) said connecting segments being separated and connected to each other and said support means by three pin joints to permit hinge-like motion; (iii) each of said pin joints having at least one pulley section thereupon; and (iv) tendon means connecting said pulley sections; and (c) a plurality of separately controllable motive force sources in mechanical communication with the articulated member, wherein the motive force is transferred directly to at least one of said pulley sections; wherein a first tendon means connects a first pulley section affixed to a first pin joint and a second pulley section free to rotate about a second pin joint, said first tendon means crossing upon itself while traversing the space between a first and a second pin joint, whereby the rotation of said first pulley section will cause rotation in the opposite direction at said second pulley section; and wherein a second tendon means connects a third pulley section affixed to said first pin joint and a fourth pulley section affixed to a second pin joint, free to rotate about said second pin joint and said second tendon means connects said fourth pulley section and a fifth pulley section affixed to a third pin joint, said second tendon means crossing upon itself while traversing the space between said fourth and fifth pulley sections, whereby the rotation of said third pulley section will cause rotation in the same direction at said fourth pulley section, and the rotation of said fourth pulley section will cause rotation in the opposite direction at said fifth pulley section; said second tendon means causing the rotation of said third, fourth and fifth pulley sections, thereby coupling the rotational translation of said second and third pin joints; and whereby, said pulley sections and tendon means are connected such that the three pin joints are mechanically coupled in a manner which provides two degrees of rotational freedom.
