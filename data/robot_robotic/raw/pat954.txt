A planning approach for obstacle avoidance for a robot arm is disclosed. In particular, the invention relates to a planning approach for obstacle avoidance in complex environments for an articulated redundant robot arm which uses a set of via points surrounding an obstacle as an intermediary point between initial and target arm positions. Via points are generated using visual perception, and possible trajectories through the via points and to the target are rehearsed prior to execution of movement. The disclosed planning method solves the "local minima" problem in obstacle avoidance; a situation in which the obstacle avoidance vectors prevent the arm from making progress toward the target.
