Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NOS: 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 11, 12, 23, 29, 31, 32, 40, 46 or 49 which inhibits the expression of human PKA catalytic subunit C-alpha. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide and has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NOS: 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47 or 48. 3. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of human PKA catalytic subunit C-alpha in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human PKA catalytic subunit C-alpha is inhibited.
