The present invention provides a method and apparatus for dispensing a small volume of a selected liquid, such as a biological sample or reagent, onto a substrate. The device includes a tube adapted to contain the liquid. An elongate fiber is disposed within the tube for axial movement therein between raised and lowered positions. Upon shifting or oscillating the fiber between its raised and lowered positions, a liquid spot can be formed at a selected position on the substrate. The device is readily adaptable for the production of micro-arrays having a great number of individual spots.
Claims It is claimed: 1. A method of forming a reagent spot on a substrate, comprising: reciprocally moving an elongate, flexible fiber longitudinally within a capillary tube holding a selected liquid at a frequency and amplitude sufficient to pump a portion of the liquid out through an orifice at a lower end of the tube, thereby forming a pendent drop; and placing the pendent drop at a selected region on the substrate. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the pendent drop is placed on the substrate by contacting an end of the fiber with the selected region of the substrate. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the pendent drop is placed on the substrate by maintaining the fiber in spaced relation over the selected region and enlarging the pendent drop until it falls under the force of gravity.
