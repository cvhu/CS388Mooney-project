Marking of the cuts which have to be made, cutting of the section at two ends, removal of the section which has to be replaced, bevelling of the joint ends of the parts remaining after the section has been cut out from the pipe, adjustment of a new or replacement section for length and bevelling of its joining ends and positioning and narrow bevel welding of the ends joining the replacement section to the ends of the remaining parts of the pipe are performed outside the pipe. Within the pipe operations of machining and inspecting an internal part of the joining ends welded together are performed by remote control in a programmed way by introducing and positioning means for working within the pipe from a component of the primary circuit. The procedure is in particular used to effect the replacement of a section of a cold leg of the primary circuit using means for carrying out work comprising a robot arm secured to a supporting chassis borne by a carriage which moves the means for carrying out work within the cold leg inserted into the cold leg through the volute of the primary pump of the nuclear reactor.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A procedure for the repair of a defective section of a pipe in the primary circuit of a nuclear reactor cooled by pressurized water connecting a first and a second component of the primary circuit, the procedure comprising the steps: assembling a self contained unitary movable robotic work device having three main parts, a programmed and remote controlled working anthropomorphic arm movable along six axes, a crawler providing motion for the device, and a support for stabilizing the device in a pipe; introducing in its entirety the robotic work device, inclusive of its three main parts, into the pipe from one of the first and second components of the primary circuit; remotely controlling the positioning of the work device within the pipe; an end part of the arm being remotely operated under computer control to selectively pick up and replace on-board automatic tools to perform tasks respectively including-- a) inspecting a pipe interior surface b) machining selected inspected interior portions of the pipe surface; and c) welding selected machined portions of the pipe interior surface.
