A kinesthetic feedback apparatus and method whereby braking forces are imposed on a hand-movable lever. The lever is either a joystick or a uniplanar lever, and the braking forces are imposed by a friction plate being pressed against a portion of the lever by a length of magnetostrictive material. An electromagnetic coil around the magnetostrictive material receives a signal from a remote apparatus driven by movement of the lever. The magnitude of the signal is a function of the resistive forces encountered by the remote apparatus so that the braking forces are directly proportional to the resistive forces thereby providing kinesthetic feedback to the person operating the lever.
Claims What is claimed and desired to be secured by United States Letters Patent is: 1. A kinesthetic feedback system for a human activated lever apparatus comprising: a lever, said lever including a rotational member and a lever arm extending outwardly from said rotational member, said lever including a housing and a friction cap adjustably mounted to said housing, said rotational member being mounted inside said housing and in frictional contact inside said friction cap; a first signal means on said lever for generating a first signal as a function of the position of said lever; an actuator means movable as a function of said first signal; a second signal means on said actuator means for generating a second signal as a function of resistive forces encountered by said actuator means upon being moved by said first signal; and a brake means on said lever, said brake means imposing a braking force on said lever as a function of said second signal, said brake means including a magnetostrictive body, a coil for inducing dimensional changes in said magnetostrictive body, and a friction plate movable upon dimensional changes in said magnetostrictive body, said friction plate being located inside said housing and pressing said rotational member against said friction cap thereby imposing said braking force on said lever, said magnetostrictive body comprising an elongated rod having a proximal end and a distal end, said coil being wrapped about said rod and with said proximal end in contact with said friction plate. 2. The kinesthetic feedback system defined in claim 1 wherein said lever comprises a lever selected from the group consisting of a uniplanar lever and a universal joystick. 3. The kinesthetic feedback system defined in claim 1 wherein said actuator means comprises a computer generated image and said second signal means comprises a computer generated second signal as a function of computer generated forces encountered by said computer generated image. 4. A kinesthetic feedback system for a human actuated lever apparatus comprising: a housing; a lever pivotally mounted on a pivot joint in said housing; a first sensor means in said housing for sensing the position of said lever, said first sensor means of generating a first signal as a function of said position of said lever; an actuator means movable as a function of said first signal; a second sensor means on said actuator means, said second sensor means generating a second signal as a function of forces encountered by said actuator means; and a brake means in said housing for braking said lever as a function of said second signal, said brake means including a friction plate in frictional engagement with said pivot joint and a magnetostrictive rod for pushing said friction plate into said frictional engagement, said magnetostrictive rod comprising an electromagnetic coil for receiving said second signal, said braking of said lever imparting a kinesthetic feedback to said lever. 5. A method for providing a kinesthetic feedback to a lever comprising the steps of: obtaining a lever; sensing movement of said lever with a first sensor on said lever, said first sensor sensing movement of said lever as a first signal; transmitting said first signal to a remote device, said first signal actuating said remote device; sensing forces encountered by said remote device with a second sensor as a second signal; returning said second signal to said lever; placing a friction plate against a movable portion of said lever; orienting a length of magnetostrictive material longitudinally against said friction plate while forming a coil around said length of magnetostrictive material; and braking movement of said lever as a function of said second signal by pressing said friction plate against said movable portion of said lever as said function of said second signal by passing said second signal through said coil thereby creating an electromagnetic field, said electromagnetic field changing said length of magnetostrictive material thereby pressing said friction plate with said length of magnetostrictive material.
