Use of calibrant in extraction phase is described for quantification of components of interest in samples in laboratory application as well as in on-site monitoring. This approach is particularly useful for in-vivo investigation of living system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A liquid phase microextraction device for extracting components contained in a sample said device comprising a flowable liquid extraction phase and an inert calibrant in said liquid extraction phase, said liquid extraction phase contained in a sheath. 2. The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said sheath is a needle. 3. The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said sheath is a porous hollow fiber membrane.
