The simulation and motion program generation software also generates graphic images of 0the robot driving the end effector through the desired path. Interactively controlling the simulation and motion program generation software through the interface, and using visual feedback provided by the monitor, the user performs collision and out-of-range checking and singularity point identification, and optimizes the motion-control program segments.
