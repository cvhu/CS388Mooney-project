A vision system for a robotic station which includes a camera for locating an object to be placed. The camera is mounted to a robotic manipulator which includes a gripper for holding the object. A mirror assembly deflects the images of the object such that it is captured by the camera. The mirror assembly comprises two face-to-face mirrors being angled at 45 degrees.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic station, comprising: a movable robotic manipulator for picking and placing an object, said movable robotic manipulator including means for holding the object; a fixed mirror assembly located adjacent to said movable robotic manipulator such that said robotic manipulator is movable relative to said mirror assembly, said mirror assembly comprising a first mirror and a second mirror; said first mirror for reflecting an image of the object as held by the movable robotic manipulator; said second mirror for deflecting the image reflected by the first mirror; a camera fixed to the movable robotic manipulator for capturing an image deflected by the second mirror and for providing corresponding image data; and a robotic controller for processing the image data to determine coordinates of the object. 2. The robotic station of claim 1, wherein the first mirror and the second mirror are positioned at a 45 degree angle with respect to a reference plane such that a substantially downward optical path is deflected substantially upward by the second mirror.
