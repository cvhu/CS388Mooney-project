A system especially adapted to retrieve, insert and transport a computer data storage cassette between spaced-apart cassette library and cassette drive unit sites. The system includes a robot carried by a movable transport assembly which is operable to transport the robot between the cassette library and cassette drive unit sites. The robot itself includes an especially adapted robotic manipulator whereby the cassette may be gripped and released. A mechanical cassette ejector is preferably provided to ensure that the cassette is expelled from the fingers of the robotic manipulator when the cassette is released. A push rod may also be provided so as to engage, and thus manipulate, a door which covers a slot of the cassette drive unit. Controlled movements of the transport system will bring the robotic manipulator into an initial position relative to the cassette in the cassette library or the cassette drive unit, such that controlled movements of the robot will then effect precise positioning of the manipulator relative to the cassette.
