An adjustable flow applicator includes a body having an axial flow pasasge and an inlet passage adapted for connection to a source of pressurized fluidic material dispensed by a positive displacement constant flow rate dispenser. A nozzle is connected to the body and communicates with the flow passage and has an orifice. A reciprocal piston rod extension is spaced within the flow passage and terminates in a tapered valve member having an advanced position seated within the orifice to shut off flow of fluidic material and first and second retracted positions variably opening the orifice for reduced flow in a first position and higher flow in a second position. First remote control includes a first piston connected to the piston extension for effecting alternate reciprocal movements of the valve member for alternately opening and closing the orifice. A second pneumatic control includes a piston rod coaxially adjacent to the first piston and includes a reciprocal second piston which has an advanced position for limiting axial retracting movements of the valve member for limited flow of material and an alternate retracted position away from the first piston so the first piston can move to a fully retracted position.
