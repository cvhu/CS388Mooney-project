A printhead assembly is provided comprising at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, a support member supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits. The assembly further comprises drive electronics incorporating at least one controller for controlling the printing operation of at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, a plurality of longitudinally extending electrical conductors arranged to provide power from a power supply to the drive electronics and the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and a loading plate for loading conductor portions of the electrical connector against respective ones of the plurality of electrical conductors.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly, comprising: at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, a support member supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits; drive electronics incorporating at least one controller for controlling the printing operation of at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits; a plurality of longitudinally extending electrical conductors arranged to provide power from a power supply to the drive electronics and the at least two printhead integrated circuits; and a loading plate for loading conductor portions of the electrical connector against respective ones of the plurality of electrical conductors, wherein the assembly is arranged so that the at least one printhead module is removable from the assembly upon removal of the drive electronics, the electrical conductors and the loading plate. 2. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, further comprising a casing in which the at least one printhead module, the drive electronics, the plurality of electrical conductors and the loading plate are removably mounted. 3. A printhead assembly according to claim 2, wherein the loading plate includes a non-conductive portion which urges the electrical connector against the plurality of electrical conductors. 4. A printhead assembly according to claim 3, wherein the non-conductive portion is formed of a resilient material. 5. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein: the at least one printhead module comprising a unitary arrangement of a support member, at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, at least one fluid distribution member mounting the at least two printhead integrated circuits to the support member, and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits; and the support member has at least one longitudinally extending channel for carrying the printing fluid for the printhead integrated circuits and includes a plurality of apertures extending through a wall of the support member arranged so as to direct the printing fluid from the at least one channel to associated nozzles in both, or if more than two, all of the printhead integrated circuits by way of respective ones of the fluid distribution members.
