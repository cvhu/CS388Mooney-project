Representation-neutral dialogue systems and methods ("RNDS") are described that include multi-application, multi-device spoken-language dialogue systems based on the information-state update approach. The RNDS includes representation-neutral core components of a dialogue system that provide scripted domain-specific extensions to routines such as dialogue move modeling and reference resolution, easy substitution of specific semantic representations and associated routines, and clean interfaces to external components for language-understanding (i.e., speech-recognition and parsing) and language-generation, and to domain-specific knowledge sources. The RNDS also resolves multi-device dialogue by evaluating and selecting among candidate dialogue moves based on features at multiple levels. Multiple sources of information are combined, multiple speech recognition and parsing hypotheses tested, and multiple device and moves considered to choose the highest scoring hypothesis overall. Confirmation and clarification behavior can be governed by the overall score.
