A self-traveling robotic vehicle having inclinable tracklaying propulsion units for operating in a hostile environment. Each propulsion unit has a track, a built-in propulsion drive for driving the track, and a built-in inclination drive for inclining the propulsion unit as required by rotating it about a transverse axis. Each propulsion unit is readily removable and therefore replaceable in the event of failure or damage to a particular propulsion unit. The vehicle is capable of movement along non-horizontal and rough surfaces while maintaining the stability of the vehicle body and any load that it might be carrying. The body of the vehicle does not comprise any mechanical parts. The vehicle is particularly useful in the nuclear industry.
