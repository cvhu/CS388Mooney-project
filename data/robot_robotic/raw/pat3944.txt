A printhead assembly is provided having at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, a support member for supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits, drive electronics incorporating at least one controller which is connected to at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits via the electrical connector for controlling the printing operation of at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and a casing in which the at least one printhead module and the drive electronics are removably mounted.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly, comprising: at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, a support member on which the at least two printhead integrated circuits are fixedly mounted, the support member being configured for supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits; drive electronics for receiving data signals related to a print job for the printhead assembly, the drive electronics incorporating a plurality of controllers for the or each printhead module respectively such that each of the controllers are micro-processors that process the data signals into print data and send fire signals to at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits respectively via the electrical connector using a device addressing protocol for controlling the printing operation of at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, the controllers and the at least two printhead integrated circuits being separate devices; and a casing in which the at least one printhead module and the drive electronics are removably mounted. 2. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein the drive electronics is provided on at least one printed circuit board which is supported by a support frame of the casing. 3. A printhead assembly according to claim 2, wherein the at least one printed circuit board carries at least one connection port for connecting with the electrical connector. 4. A printhead assembly according to claim 3, wherein the at least one connection port is aligned with the electrical connector. 5. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein: the at least one printhead module is formed as a unitary arrangement of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, the support member, the electrical connector and at least one fluid distribution member mounting the at least two printhead integrated circuits to the support member; and the support member has at least one longitudinally extending channel for carrying the printing fluid for the printhead integrated circuits and includes a plurality of apertures extending through a wall of the support member arranged so as to direct the printing fluid from the at least one channel to associated nozzles in both, or if more than two, all of the printhead integrated circuits by way of respective ones of the fluid distribution members.
