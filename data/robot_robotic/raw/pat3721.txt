The invention provides apoptosis signaling kinase related kinase (ASKRK) nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences and methods of using such sequences to identify modulators of ASKRK. Such modulators can be used for the treatment of diabetes or for delaying the onset of diabetes. The invention also provides methods of diagnosing diabetes or pre-diabetes and methods of making a prognosis based on the detection of ASKRK nucleic acids and proteins.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO:2. 2. The isolated nucleic acid of claim 1, wherein the nucleic acid comprises SEQ ID NO:1. 3. An expression vector comprising the nucleic acid of claim 1. 4. A host cell in vitro comprising the expression vector of claim 3. 5. The host cell of claim 4, wherein the host cell is a pancreatic beta cell.
