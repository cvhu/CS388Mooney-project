An end-effector that loads disks into a pallet of a sputtering machine, for example, has a two-piece mandrel with a rigid inner core and a plastic outer sleeve slideably axially mounted on the core. The sleeve is attached to the core with a coupling providing a predetermined attachment force. A breakaway force exerted on the sleeve that exceeds the attachment force causes the sleeve to separate from the mandrel, this separation being sensed by a breakaway sensor.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mandrel for transporting disks, comprising: a longitudinally extending rigid core; a sleeve having an outer circumference with grooves for retaining disks and a bore extending to at least one of the grooves, the core extending in the bore through the sleeve to the at least one of the grooves when the sleeve and core are in an assembled position; and a releasable securement arrangement that secures the sleeve on the core and releases the sleeve from the core upon application of a predetermined force on the sleeve. 2. The mandrel of claim 1, further comprising a breakaway sensor coupled to at least one of the core and the sleeve that senses release of the sleeve from the core. 3. The mandrel of claim 2, further comprising a disk presence sensor coupled to the core and detecting presence of a disk. 4. The mandrel of claim 3, wherein the sleeve is plastic and has 25 said grooves. 5. The mandrel of claim 4, wherein the releasable securement arrangement comprises magnets. 6. A mandrel for transporting disks, comprising: a sleeve with grooves for retaining disks and a core slidably received within the sleeve; and means for releasably securing the sleeve to the core and detecting releasing of the securing of the sleeve to the core. 7. The mandrel of claim 1, wherein the bore extends completely through the sleeve and the core extends completely through the bore when the sleeve and the core are in an assembled position.
