A method for cutting steel includes heating a portion of the steel until it is molten, positioning a cutting torch to have a high angle of incidence relative to the molten steel, and blasting high pressure oxygen at the molten metal. The blast of high pressure oxygen further heats the molten metal and blows the molten metal away from the steel to create a cutting trench. The cutting torch is then moved generally parallel to the cutting method includes a cutting torch that emits a high pressure combustible gas and a high pressure combustion enhancing gas. The torch directs the high pressure gases at the steel so that the gases hit the steel at an acute angle of attack. An automated device propels the torch in the general direction of the desired cut. The resultant cut metal product has at least one edge with a grain pattern that is not perpendicular to the direction of cut.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A piece of cut metal formed by a metal cutting apparatus, comprising: first and second surfaces, said first and second surfaces being disposed on opposite sides of said cut metal; and an edge connecting said first and second surfaces, wherein said edge has a grain pattern that is not perpendicular to said first and second surfaces of said cut metal. 2. The piece of cut metal according to claim 1, wherein said grain pattern of said edge is diagonal to at least one of said first and second surfaces of said cut metal. 3. The piece of cut metal according to claim 1, wherein said grain pattern of said edge is about parallel to at least one of said first and second surfaces of said cut metal. 4. The piece of cut metal according to claim 1, wherein said grain pattern of said edge has a diverging pattern.
