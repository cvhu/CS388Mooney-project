Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a coding region from nucleobases 172-2433, a 5'-untranslated region, a start codon or a 3'-untranslated region of a nucleic acid encoding human liver glycogen phosphorylase, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human liver glycogen phosphorylase. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, or 47 which inhibits the expression of human liver glycogen phosphorlyase. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. the antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A method of inhibiting the expression of human liver glycogen phosphorlyase in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human liver glycogen phosphorylase is inhibited. 12. The antisense compound of claim 3 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 14. The antisense compound of claim 13 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 15. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 16. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 17. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 18. The antisense compound of claim 17 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 19. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 20. A method of inhibiting the expression of human liver glycogen phosphorylase in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 3 so that expression of human liver glycogen phosphorylase is inhibited.
