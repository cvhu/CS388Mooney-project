A hand held pickup tool is disclosed having a pickup head which may selectively operate as a suction cup for holding small parts or as a venturi effect lift device. For the suction cup mode the tool is supplied with a vacuum and in the venturi lift mode with a positive air flow. A pneumatic circuit is disclosed which includes a venturi vacuum generator operated by a source of shop compressed air. By a simple air switch, the operator may select whether the circuit provides vacuum to the pickup tool or whether the venturi generator is, effectively bypassed to supply a positive air flow to the tool. Various examples of pickup heads for the tool are disclosed which function selectively either as suction holders or venturi lift devices.
Claims I claim: 1. A hand held pneumatic pickup tool comprising: a central body portion containing an air chamber and having an input air port connected thereto, a forward nozzle portion, a finger operated valve coupled between said air chamber and said nozzle portion, a pneumatic pump pickup head carried by said nozzle portion and having a flat holding plate surface for pulling or lifting and holding a small part theretoward, a central duct connected to said nozzle portion for communicating lifting air flow between said holding plate surface and said nozzle portion, and lateral, part retaining means carried by said pickup pickup head and extending through the plane of said holding plate surface, and a venturi vacuum generator having a venturi input port, a venturi output port and an exhaust port, a first air switch connected between said venturi input port and a source of compressed air, a second air switch connected to said exhaust port, and connection means disposed between said venturi output port and said input air port of said central body portion.
