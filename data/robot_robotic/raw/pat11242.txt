An apparatus and method are provided for on-line measurement of a lathe cing tool position using a measuring head with a rotatable square plate engaged with three cylindrical plungers and a positioning mechanism for pivoting the measuring head. The positioning mechanism includes a movable member mounted on a base on the lathe headstock and a rotating unit for rotating the movable member about an axis. A stop member is provided to stop the movable member at a locating position. The measuring head includes a square plate supported inside a housing and rotatable about a y-axis therein. The plungers extend into the housing to contact the plate near its corners. In response to a force applied by a cutting tool mounted in a turret, the plungers move respectively in +x, -x, -z directions relative to the housing to cause the square plate to rotate correspondingly. A transducer detects the rotation of the square plate and provides an output signal which is calibrated to yield an indication of the absolute displacement of the plunger and hence the position of the cutting tool relative to a machine datum position.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A measuring head for measuring a position of a machine cutting tool relative to a datum position on a machine tool, comprising: a housing supported on said machine tool; a plate supported inside said housing, said plate being rotatably supported about an axis oriented transversely relative to a face of said plate; at least two elongated plungers mounted on said housing, each plunger having a free end extending outside said housing for engaging with said machine cutting tool and another end engageable with said plate inside said housing, each plunger being slidable in a rectilinear stroke toward and away from said plate, said plungers being spaced apart from each other, each plunger being oriented off-center relative to said axis about which said plate is rotatable so that sliding displacement of each plunger in at least a portion of said rectilinear stroke relative to said plate causes the sliding plunger to push said plate to cause said plate to rotate about said axis; a position transducer means mounted on said housing and engaging with said plate, for measuring rotation of said plate about said axis and for producing an output signal representing an amount of said rotation and a corresponding displacement of a said plunger; said plate being substantially flat and square in shape, said axis being oriented substantially perpendicular to said face of said plate, and said plungers comprising first, second and third plungers disposed substantially coplanar with said plate, two said plungers being generally parallel to each other and disposed to engage diagonally opposite corners of said plate, and another of said plungers being disposed generally normal to said two plungers to engage another corner of said plate. 2. The measuring head of claim 1, further comprising a shaft rotatably supporting said plate about said axis, precision pre-loaded bearings rotatably supporting said shaft, and a ground spacer means mounted between one of said bearings and said plate to prevent axial motion of said plate relative to said axis. 3. The measuring head of claim 1, wherein each plunger is keyed to said housing to allow no rotation of said plungers relative to said housing. 4. The measuring head of claim 1, further comprising a spring attached on one end to said housing and on another end to one of said shaft and said plate to provide a bias to return said plate and said plungers to respective rest positions. 5. A method of measuring a position of a machine cutting tool relative to a datum position on a machine tool, comprising: providing a plate supported inside a housing supported on said machine tool, said plate being rotatably supported about an axis oriented transversely to a face of said plate; mounting at least two spaced apart elongated plungers on said housing to extend into said interior of said housing, each plunger having a free end extending outside said housing for engaging with said machine cutting tool and another end engageable with said plate inside said housing, each plunger being oriented off-center relative to said axis about which said plate is rotatable; mounting a position transducer means on said housing in engagement with said plate; separately sliding said plungers in rectilinear strokes toward said plate to push said plate to cause said plate to rotate about said axis; using said position transducer means to measure amounts of rotation of said plate about said axis, responsive to separate sliding actions of said plunger; producing output signals with said position transducer means, said output signal representing said amounts of said rotation and corresponding separate displacements of said plungers; and forming said plate to be substantially flat and square in shape, said axis being oriented substantially perpendicular to said face of said plate, said plungers comprising first, second and third plungers, positioning said plungers substantially coplanar with said plate, positioning two said plungers generally parallel to each other and to engage with diagonally opposite corners of said plate and positioning another of said plungers generally normal to said two plungers to engage another corner of said plate.
