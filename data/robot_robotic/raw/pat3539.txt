A method for simulating the insertion of a data storage medium into or removal of a data storage medium from an input/output station, alternatively referred to as an import/output station. In one application of the invention, a data storage resides in an I/O station slot. A first variable corresponding to this slot is modified to indicate that the slot is actually empty. A command is issued indicating that the I/O station has been accessed, triggering a scan of the slot by an automated robotic accessor. Since the accessor will detect that the slot is, in fact, full, it will report this status to a library manager which will, in turn, update the first variable. The action of updating this variable is reported to associated devices such as a host computer, host application, or other associated device. In this manner, the operation of the library manager and devices receiving status information may be tested without requiring that a physical data storage medium actually be removed and re-inserted.
Claims We claim: 1. A simulated data storage medium insertion/ejection system, comprising: an import/export station having a plurality of I/O slots adapted to transfer storage media to and from a storage library, wherein at least one I/O slot is full and at least one I/O slot is empty; a memory device for storing a variable having a value representing a status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots; a processor in communication with the memory device; and a sensor for detecting the status of each import/export station I/O slot in communication with the processor; wherein the processor is adapted to ascertain a correct value of the variable for each import/export I/O slot using said sensor, modify the value of the variable so as to be inconsistent with the status of the import/export station I/O slot and to simulate an opening and closing of a door of the import/export station I/O slots, thereby triggering a scan by the sensor of the-import/export station I/O slots to determine the status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots; wherein the processor is further adapted to update the value of the variable so as to be consistent with the status of the import/export station I/O slots based on said scanning; and wherein the processor is further adapted to report the update of the value of the variable to an external device. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein the data storage medium includes a tape cartridge. 3. An automated data storage library, comprising: an import/export station for receiving and ejecting a data storage medium, the input/export station having a plurality of I/O slots adapted to transfer storage media to and from said automated data storage library, wherein at least one I/O is full and at least one I/O slot is empty; a memory device for storing a variable having a value representing a status of each of the import/export station I/O slots; a processor in communication with the memory device; and a sensor for detecting the status of each of the import/export station I/O slots in communication with the processor; wherein the processor is adapted to ascertain a correct value of the variable, modify the value of the variable so as to be inconsistent with the status of each of the import/export station I/O slots and to simulate an opening and closing of a door of the import/export station, thereby triggering a scan by the sensor of each of the import/export station I/O slots to determine the status of each of the plurality if import/export station I/O slots; wherein the processor is further adapted to update the value of the variable so as to be consistent with the status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots in response to the scan by the sensor of the import/export stations; and wherein the processor is further adapted to report the update of the value of the variable to an external device. 4. The automated data storage library of claim 3, wherein the data storage medium includes a tape cartridge. 5. A method of simulating a change in a status of an import/export station having a plurality of I/O slots adapted to transfer storage media to and from a storage library, wherein at least one I/O slot is full and at least one I/O slot is empty, the method comprising the steps of: ascertaining a correct value of a variable representing the status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots; modifying the variable so as to be inconsistent with the status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots; simulating an opening and closing of a door of the import/export station, thereby triggering a scan to determine the status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots; and updating the variable so as to be consistent with the status of each of the plurality of import/export station I/O slots, and reporting the step of updating the variable to an external device. 6. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of scanning each of the import/export station I/O slots. 7. The method of claim 5, wherein the variable may include a value indicating that a data storage medium is inserted into said at least one of the import/export station I/O slots. 8. The method of claim 5, wherein the variable may include a value indicating that said at least one of the import/export station I/O slots is empty. 9. The method of claim 7, wherein the data storage medium includes a tape cartridge. 10. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of moving a virtual element address from a full import/export station slot to an empty import/export station slot prior to said step of modifying the variable representing the status of one of the import/export station I/O slots so as to be inconsistent with the status of said import/export station I/O slots. 11. The method of claim 10, further comprising the step of placing a data storage device into a slot of the import/export station prior to said step of moving the virtual element address from the full import/export station slot to the empty import/export station slot. 12. The method of claim 10, further comprising the step of populating the slots of the import/export station such that the slots of the import/export station are half-full and half-empty prior to said step of moving the virtual element address from the full import/export station slot to the empty import/export station slot.
