Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase are provided.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for improving liver function in an animal in need thereof comprising administering an effective amount of an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) to the animal in need of improved liver function, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human SCD1, and wherein liver function is improved. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the animal has elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) or both. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein administration of the antisense oligonucleotide reduces ALT levels, AST levels or both levels in the animal. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is 20 nucleobases in length. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is at least 95% complementarity to nucleotides 13-71, 178-247, 482-843, 892-1064, 1597-2233, 2245-2589, 2676-3278, 2980-3054, 3342-3499, 3655-3674, 3707-3790, 3825-3853, 3911-4072, 4132-4224, 4261-4398, 4420-4554, 4645-4677, 4834-4865, or 4892-5100 of SEQ ID NO: 3. 6. The method of claim 5, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is 100% complementary to SEQ ID NO: 3. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one phosphorothioate linkage. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 9. The method of claim 8, wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one 5-methylcytosine. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric antisense oligonucleotide having a 2'-deoxynucleotide gap segment positioned between 5' and 3' wing segments, wherein each nucleotide of each wing segment comprises a modified sugar moiety. 12. The method of claim 11, wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 13. The method of claim 11, wherein the gap segment is 10 nucleotides in length and each of the wing segments is 5 nucleotides in length. 14. The method of claim 11, wherein the chimeric antisense oligonucleotide consists of 20 linked nucleosides. 15. The method of claim 14, wherein at least one internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 16. The method of claim 11, wherein the chimeric antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one 5-methylcytosine. 17. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.
