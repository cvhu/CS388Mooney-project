Artificial muscle analog 1000 is located within hollow exoskeletal bone 10. Muscle 1000 comprises inflatable bladder 120, cable 130, roller 140, anchor point 150, and connection means 160 whereby said bladder may be inflated and deflated. Bladder 120 is affixed to the interior surface of said bone. Cable 130, attached to bone 10 at point 150, passes over bladder 120 and through roller 140. Cable 130, if unobstructed and taut, takes a shortest path from point 150 to roller 140. When inflated, bladder 120 forces cable 130 to deviate from this shortest path, pulling cable 130 in through said roller, under tension. In their paired opposing muscle form 2000, the artificial muscles synergistically assist each other when used in opposition. Paired muscles 2000 may actuate a robotic arm 3000, and are easily controlled by the associated simple low-cost control systems 100a,b,c of the present invention.
