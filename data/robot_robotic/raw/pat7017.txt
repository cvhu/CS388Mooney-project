A proximity sensing assembly for sensing the proximity of a metallic workpiece to a work holding device includes Hall-effect sensor. The magnetic field generated by the magnet is altered when a metallic workpiece is in close proximity to a magnet. Due to an offset relationship between the sensor and the poles of the magnet, the polarity detected by the Hall-effect sensor is analogous to a reversal when a metallic workpiece is proximate the magnet rather than simply detecting a change in strength. Thus the polarity detected by the Hall-effect sensor sends a clearly defined signal indicating the presence or absence of a workpiece in the work holding device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A gripper assembly comprising: a pair of appendages, with at least one of said appendages being pivotably moveable relative to a second of said appendages; and a proximity sensor for sensing the presence of a work piece between said appendages, said sensor mounted within said one of said appendages, and a cable including a coiled portion communicating said sensor to a controller, said coiled portion allowing said cable to stretch as said one appendage pivots relative to said other appendage. 2. A gripper assembly as set forth in claim 1, wherein said cable is fixed to said appendage, with said coiled portion extending from a location at which said cable is fixed to said appendage.
