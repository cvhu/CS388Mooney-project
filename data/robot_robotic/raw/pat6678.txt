An apparatus for press fitting inserts into corresponding receptacles in workpieces includes a press comprising a ram and a backup tool spaced from the ram. An insertion tool is alignable between the ram and the backup tool. An insert magazine feeds inserts to the insertion tool. A workpiece positioner sequentially moves each workpiece through receiving positions that align the receptacles with the insertion tool between the ram and the backup tool. The ram repeatedly engages the insertion tool to press fit an insert into each of the corresponding receptacles. The backup tool supports the workpiece against the force of press-fit insertion.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for press fitting inserts into a first and second plurality of receptacles in a single workpiece, the method including the steps of: providing a single press having a ram and a backup tool in alignment with the press; providing a shuttle that is movable relative to the press and the ram; providing first and second insertion tools carried by the shuttle; providing first and second insert magazines carried by the shuttle adjacent the first and second insertion tools, respectively; providing first and second pluralities of inserts in the first and second insert magazines, respectively; providing a workpiece positioner adjacent the press; moving the shuttle to align the first insertion tool with the press between the ram and the backup tool; actuating the workpiece positioner to move a workpiece sequentially through a first plurality of receiving positions in which respective ones of a first plurality of receptacles in the same workpiece are each aligned with the single press and the ram between the first insertion tool and the backup tool; serially press fitting each insert of the first plurality of inserts in corresponding ones of the first plurality of receptacles in the same workpiece by actuating the press and the ram to actuate the first insertion tool to force an insert into the workpiece when the workpiece is in each position of the first plurality of receiving positions; actuating the workpiece positioner to move a workpiece sequentially through a second plurality of receiving positions in which respective ones of a second plurality of receptacles in the same workpiece are each aligned with the single press and the ram between the second insertion tool and the backup tool; and, serially press fitting each insert of the second plurality of inserts in corresponding ones of the second plurality of receptacles in the same workpiece by actuating the press and the ram to actuate the second insertion tool to force an insert into the workpiece when the workpiece is in each position of the second plurality of receiving positions. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: providing a third insertion tool carried by the shuttle; providing a third insert magazine carried by the shuttle adjacent the third insertion tool; providing a third plurality of inserts in the third insert magazine; moving the shuttle to align the third insertion tool with the press between the ram and the backup tool after the step of moving the shuttle to align the second insertion tool with the press between the ram and the backup tool; after actuating the workpiece positioner to move the same workpiece sequentially through the second plurality of receiving positions actuating the workpiece positioner to move the same workpiece sequentially through a third plurality of receiving positions in which respective ones of a third plurality of receptacles in the same workpiece are each aligned with the single press and the third insertion tool between the ram and the backup tool; and after serially press fitting each insert of the first and second pluralities of inserts, serially press fitting each insert of the third plurality of inserts into corresponding ones of the third plurality of receptacles by actuating the press and the ram to actuate the third insertion tool to force an insert into the same workpiece when the same workpiece is in each position of the third plurality of receiving positions. 3. The method of claim 2 in which the step of serially press fitting each insert of the third plurality of inserts in corresponding ones of the third plurality o f receptacles includes: actuating the workpiece positioner to move the same workpiece sequentially through the first and second plurality of receiving positions; and actuating the press and the ram to actuate the third insertion tool when the workpiece is in each position of the first and second pluralities of receiving positions, the third plurality of receiving positions including both the first and the second pluralities of receiving positions and the receptacles of the third plurality of receptacles each being coaxially aligned with respective receptacles of both the first and second pluralities of receptacles. 4. A method for press fitting a first series of inserts into a first series of receptacles in a workpiece, the method including the steps of: providing a single press and a ram and a backup tool spaced from the ram; providing a workpiece positioner for positioning a workpiece between the rain and the backup tool; providing a first series of inserts between the ram and the backup tool; actuating the workpiece positioner to move the workpiece sequentially through a first plurality of receiving positions in which a first series of receptacles in the workpiece are each sequentially aligned with the single press and ram; serially press fitting each insert of the first series of inserts into corresponding ones of the first series of receptacles in the workpiece by actuating the press and the ram to force an insert into the workpiece when the workpiece is in each position of the first plurality of receiving positions; providing a second series of inserts; actuating the workpiece positioner to move the workpiece sequentially through a second plurality of receiving positions in which a second series of receptacles in the workpiece are each aligned with the single press and ram; sequentially press fitting each insert of the second plurality of inserts into corresponding ones of the second series of receptacles in the workpiece by actuating the press and the ram to force an insert of the second plurality of inserts into the workpiece when the workpiece is in each position of the second plurality of receiving positions; providing a shuttle movable relative to the ram of the press; providing a first insertion tool carried by the shuttle; moving the shuttle to align the first insertion tool with the press and the ram prior to press fitting the inserts of the first series of inserts into the workpiece; providing a second insertion tool carried by the shuttle; and moving the shuttle to align the second insertion tool with the press and the ram prior to press fitting the inserts of the second series of inserts into the workpiece. 5. The method of claim 4 further comprising the steps of: providing first and second insert magazines carried by the shuttle adjacent the first and second insertion tools, respectively; and providing first and second pluralities of inserts in the first and second insert magazines, respectively; whereby the first insert magazine feeds the first plurality of inserts to the first insertion tool to be press fit into the workpiece, and the second insert magazine feeds the second plurality of inserts to the second insertion tool to be press fit into the workpiece.
