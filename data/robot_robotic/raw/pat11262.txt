An electronic apparatus is proposed for detecting variations of significance in an electrical voltage as a function of time. The apparatus includes a tracker (2) of these variations, a comparator (6) comparing the voltage with a reference voltage V.sub.2, and a counting circuit (10, 15, 20). The tracker (2) monitors variations in the voltage supplied to a filtering and rectification system (4), which eliminates the continuous component of the signal and within the high frequency range greatly diminishes the levels of the parasitic signals having an oscillatory character. The comparator (6) furnishes a calibrated pulse (25) each time the voltage exceeds the threshold V.sub.2, and the counting circuit (10, 15, 20) counts the number of these calibrated pulses within a given time period T and furnishes a logic signal (30) if this number exceeds a predetermined quantity.
