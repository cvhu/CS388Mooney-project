An industrial robot system comprising a plurality of robots for conducting a work in cooperation with each other. A system clock is provided in the system, and clocks are provided in the respective robots. These clocks are counted up at the same cycle time, and are set for original points of the respective robots, which are the waiting positions thereof, and the clock values of the robots located in the respective positions during the drive operation. During the drive of the system, the system clock is advanced by adding a predetermined increment value thereto, and the respective robots held under the enabling condition, start the operations by advancing the robot clocks by adding the same increment value as that of the system clock.
