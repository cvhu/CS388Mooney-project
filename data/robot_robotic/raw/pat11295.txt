High power laser energy for material processing is delivered via a high energy optical fiber to a remote output module carried by an industrial robot. A plural path optical system within the output module focuses the high-energy laser onto the material to be processed, and additionally transmits images for closed-loop robotic control through one or more fiber optic bundles. Thus vision and seam tracking for an industrial robot are integrated with a neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser. To provide an interlock which guards against interruption of the high energy optical fiber, a laser transmission sensor is included within the remote module. A wide range of closed-loop laser materials processing operations can be performed, such as cutting, welding, drilling and heat treatment. The processing operations can be performed even on complex, three-dimensional parts.
