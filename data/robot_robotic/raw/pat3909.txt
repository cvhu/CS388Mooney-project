Methods are provided where: a signal is transmitted from an illuminating source and received cavity waveguides disposed on an object; a position and/or orientation of the object is determined based on the signal received in the waveguides; and data representing the determined position and/or orientation is transmitted to a remote location or generated for use in the object. The illuminating source can also be moved to indicate a change in a predetermined trajectory or target position where a new position and/or orientation of the object is determined based on the signal received in the waveguides and the object is controlled to change the predetermined trajectory or target position to the indicated new predetermined trajectory or new target position. A change can also be detected in the predetermined trajectory or target position and the object controlled to correct the change.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for transmitting data from a moving object to a receiver at a remote location, the method comprising: transmitting a signal from an illuminating source; receiving the signal at three or more cavity waveguides disposed on the object; determining at least one of a position and orientation of the object relative to the illuminating source based on a strength of the signal received in the three or more cavity waveguides; transmitting data representing at least one of the determined position and orientation to the receiver; and testing the accuracy of at least one of the three or more cavity waveguides based on the transmitted data. 2. A method for generating data representing at least one of a determined position and orientation of a moving object, the method comprising: transmitting a signal from an illuminating source; receiving the signal at three or more cavity waveguides disposed on the object; determining at least one of a position and orientation of the object relative to the illuminating source based on a strength of the signal received in the three or more cavity waveguides; generating data representing at least one of the determined position and orientation for use in the object; transmitting data representing at least one of the determined position and orientation to a receiver; and testing the accuracy of at least one of the three or more cavity waveguides based on the transmitted data.
