Tooling is described for securing to the movable end of a computer-controlled robotic arm, by which articles can be picked up, optionally rotated and lowered into a new position. The tooling comprises two blades each having a leading edge and trailing edge, movable between a first position in which their leading edges are separated by a large gap and a second position in which the leading edges overlap, or are in contact or are separated by a smaller gap. A movement restraining mechanism is included which comprises at least one resiliency deformable member located above the plane containing the two blades and spaced therefrom by a distance which is less than the thickness of each article to be picked up by the tooling. In use, as the tooling is lowered onto an article. the underside of the deformable member engages the upper surface of the article and becomes deformed in order to accommodate the thickness of the article before the blades make contact with a surface on which the article rests.
