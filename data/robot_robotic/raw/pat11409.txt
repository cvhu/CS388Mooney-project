A cable severing station for severing a flat cable at a position adjacent to electrical connectors to which the cable has been terminated, comprises a cable gripping unit having cable grippers which can be moved between an open position to allow the cable with the connectors thereon to be fed therethrough and a closed cable gripping position; and a cutting second unit for gripping the cable and the connectors and for severing the cable at positions close to the connectors. The cable is first fed through the grippers of the cable gripping unit when these are in an open position, and the cable cutting unit is then moved into the cable gripping unit to carry out the cable severing operations. Where, in mixed lead making operations, sections of cable are to be slugged out from between two connectors which project from the same side of the cable and from between two connectors which project from opposite sides of the cable, a cable cutting unit is provided for each of these severing operations, these units being movable alternatively into the cable gripping unit.
