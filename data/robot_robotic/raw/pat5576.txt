A system of interactive toys comprising: at least one toys, each individual toy having a fanciful physical appearance, a speaker mounted on the individual toy and a user input receiver operative to receive input from a user relating to that user's interaction with said individual toy; and a content controller operative to log information, received from said user input receivers, relating to individual past interactions between each user and toy, and to utilize said information relating to individual past interactions, to subsequently control at least one of the toys. 2. A system according to claim 1 wherein said content controller subsequently controls the selection of content to be output from the speaker of at least one of the toys. 3. A system according to claim 1 wherein the content controller identifies the user interacting with an individual toy. 4. An interactive toy method comprising: providing at least one toys, each individual toy having a fanciful physical appearance, a speaker mounted on the individual toy and a user input receiver operative to receive input from a user relating to that user's interaction with said individual toy; and logging information, received from said user input receivers, relating to individual past interactions between each user and toy, and utilizing said information relating to individual past interactions, to subsequently control at least one of the toys.
