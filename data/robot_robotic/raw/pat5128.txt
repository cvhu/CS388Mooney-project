An innovative robotic foam application process that integrates system communications, non-contact vehicle insertion point locations, and applications controls to accurately dispense a two-component structural foam at a high volume and flow rate. The process begins by first inserting a baffle within the support structure. After an electrocoat application and bake, the baffles expand and are sealed within the support structure to form cavities having a fill hole. A hydraulic driven robotic dispensing system equipped with a high-pressure static mixer senses the respective fill hole, moves a robotic arm to a location sensed, and injects a high volume of mixed two-component viscous material within each of the respective located fill holes at a high fill rate. After dispensing, the viscous material undergoes an exothermic curing reaction to cure and is expanded to substantially fill each cavity.
