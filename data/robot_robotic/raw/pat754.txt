The present invention relates to novel sequences for use in detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including cancer. The invention provides novel splice products of human DKKL-1 gene. The present invention provides methods of using polynucleotides having the novel splice products of the human DKKL-1 sequences, their corresponding gene products and modulators of the DKKL-1 splice products for the detection, diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of associated cancers.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for detecting one or more cancer cells expressing a Dickkopf-like 1 (DKKL-1) splice product in a sample, the method comprising contacting the sample with an antibody that specifically binds the DKKL-1 splice product, does not specifically bind to wild-type DKKL-1, wherein the antibody is labeled, the label is a radioisotope selected from the group consisting of: .sup.18F, .sup.43K, .sup.52Fe, .sup.57Co, .sup.67Cu, .sup.67Ga, .sup.77Br, .sup.87MSr, .sup.86Y, .sup.90Y, .sup.99MTc, .sup.111In, .sup.123I, .sup.125I, .sup.127Cs, .sup.129Cs, .sup.131I, .sup.132I, .sup.197Hg, .sup.203Pb, .sup.206Bi and detecting the label in the sample. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the antibody specifically binds to SEQ ID NO. 4. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the cancer cell is selected from the group consisting of lung, ovary, lymphoid and liver cancer. 5. The method of claim 4, wherein the lung cancer cell is mesothelioma or non-small cell lung cancer. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the antibody specifically binds to SEQ ID NO. 6. 7. The method of claim 6, wherein the cancer cell is selected from the group consisting of lung, breast or liver cancer. 8. The method of claim 7, wherein the lung cancer cell is mesothelioma or non-small cell lung cancer. 9. The method of claim 7, wherein the breast cancer cell is selected from the group consisting of ductal adenocarcinoma, lobular adenocarcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma.
