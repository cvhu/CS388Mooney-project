An industrial robot apparatus for palletizing or depalletizing loads onto or from a pallet, having a robot body, a slider supported on the robot body and movable in a first direction, a mechanism for moving the slider, a first arm provided on one end of the slider and rotatable parallel to a plane perpendicular to the first direction, a first motor for rotating the first arm, a second arm provided on a distal end of the first arm, rotatable parallel to the perpendicular plane and substantially extendible and retractable, a second motor for rotating the second arm, an extension/retraction mechanism for substantially extending and retracting the second arm, a wrist provided on a distal end of the second arm, rotatable parallel to the perpendicular plane and used to hold a load; and a third motor for rotating the wrist.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An industrial robot apparatus for palletizing loads on pallets or depalletizing said loads from said pallets, comprising: a robot body; a slider supported on said robot body, said slider being movable in a first direction; slider moving means for moving said slider; a first arm, a proximal end of said first arm provided on one end of said slider, said first arm being rotatable parallel to a plane perpendicular to the first direction; first rotation means provided on said proximal end of said first arm for rotating said first arm; a second arm, a proximal end of said second arm provided below a distal end of said first arm, said second arm being rotatable parallel to the perpendicular plane and substantially rectilinearly extendible and retractable parallel to the perpendicular plane; second rotation means provided on said proximal end of said second arm for rotating said second arm; extension/retraction means for substantially extending said second arm or retracting said second arm to a position under said first arm; a wrist provided on a distal end of said second arm, said wrist being rotatable parallel to the perpendicular plane and movable to a desired position for holding one of said loads by extending or retracting said second arm; and third rotation means provided on said distal end of said second arm for rotating said wrist, such that said wrist is positionable to said desired position over one of said pallets without said robot apparatus interfering with adjacent palletized loads. 2. An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said extension/retraction means includes a rack fixed on said second arm so as to extend along a longitudinal direction of said second arm, a pinion meshing with said rack, and a servo motor for rotating said pinion. 3. An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said servo motor has a speed reduction mechanism.
