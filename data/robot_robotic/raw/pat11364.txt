A robotic gripper tool pivots under the force of gravity to orient itself to enable the actuation of a selected gripping surface. The self-pivoting action is accomplished solely by the force of gravity acting upon the mass distribution of the tool with respect to the pivot axis of the tool. Several different gripping surfaces are provided on the tool whereby time consuming tool changes are substantially eliminated. The gripper tool is pivotally connected to a robotic arm. By pitching the robotic arm, the self-pivoting tool will be positioned by the gravitational force acting upon it.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic gripper tool having a plurality of separately actuable gripping surfaces, each of which is oriented by a self-pivoting action of said robotic gripper tool under gravitational force, comprising: a first pair of opposed body members, each of said first pair of opposed body members having an aperture along a common axis, wherein said first pair of opposed body members forms a first and a second pair of gripping surfaces, said second pair of gripping surfaces located substantially orthogonal to said first pair of gripping surfaces; and, a second pair of opposed body members, the inner surfaces of said second pair abutting the outer surfaces of said first pair of opposed body members, each of said second pair of opposed body members having a shaft fittable into an adjacent aperture in said first pair of opposed members, whereby said first pair of opposed body members is pivotable with respect to said second pair of opposed body members about said common axis. 2. A robotic gripping tool according to claim 1 wherein said first pair of opposed body members further comprises a magnet gripping surface on one of said opposed body members.
