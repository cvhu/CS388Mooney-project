The lift-pin assembly of claim 1 wherein said connector is fabricated from a polymer. 5. The lift-pin assembly of claim 1 wherein said actuator pin comprises a projecting portion positioned proximate said actuator end of said connector wherein said lips of said first plurality of catch fingers of said connector snap fit over said projecting portion. 6. The lift-pin assembly of claim 1 wherein said actuator pin is fabricated from a ceramic material. 7. A semiconductor wafer processing chamber, comprising: a substrate support platform having a centrally disposed recess; a base disposed above said centrally disposed recess; a substrate support disposed over said base; a plurality of lift-pin holes extending through said support platform, said base, said substrate support, and circumscribing said centrally disposed recess; a plurality of modular lift-pin assemblies slidably extending through said lift-pin holes; said modular lift-pin assemblies each comprising: a lift pin having a distal end; a connector, comprising: an actuator end having a plurality of catch fingers disposed around said actuator end, wherein each of said plurality of catch fingers includes a lip extending radially inwards; a lift pin end coupled to said distal end of said lift-pin; and an actuator pin coupled to the actuator end of said connector; and a lift-arm assembly disposed below said base and engaging said plurality of modular lift-pin assemblies. 8. The processing chamber of claim 7 wherein each of said lift-pins is slidably disposed through a corresponding first bushing in said substrate support. 9. The processing chamber of claim 8 wherein said actuator pin is slidably disposed through a second bushing in said support platform and said actuator pin extends below said support platform. 10. The processing chamber of claim 9 wherein said actuator pin is guided by said second bushing. 11. The lift-pin assembly of claim 7 wherein said distal end of said lift-pin is inserted into a bore of said lift-pin end of said connector. 12. The processing chamber of claim 7 wherein each of said plurality of catch fingers includes a lip extending radially inwards, said lip having a flat that is substantially perpendicular to a central axis of said connector. 13. The processing chamber of claim 12 wherein said actuator pin comprises a projecting portion positioned proximate said actuator end of said connector, wherein said lips of said plurality of catch fingers of said connector snap fit over said projecting portion. 14. The processing chamber of claim 13 wherein said projecting portion having a diameter greater than a diameter defined by said lips of said plurality of catch fingers and said projecting portion having an undercut, and the flat of said lips bank against said undercut of said projecting portion to secure said actuator pin to said actuator end of said connector. 15. The processing chamber of claim 14 wherein said greater diameter portion of said actuator pin is positioned to lift a lift-pin side of said second bushing, and said greater diameter portion is larger than an inside diameter of said second bushing, wherein travel of said lift-pin away from said support surface is limited. 16. The processing chamber of claim 7 wherein said lift-arm assembly comprises: a substantially C-shaped lift-pin ring: an actuation arm coupled to said C-shaped lift-pin ring and a connecting portion disposed at a distal end of said actuation arm; and a plurality of wear pads disposed on an upper surface of said substantially C-shaped lift-pin ring. 17. The processing chamber of claim 18 wherein said actuator pins of said lift-pin assemblies are disposed on the wear pads. 18. The processing chamber of claim 17 wherein said wear pads are larger in diameter of said actuator pins such that misalignment between said actuator pins and said C-shaped lift-pin rings is compensated for. 19. The processing chamber of claim 18 wherein said support platform further comprises a C-shaped slot in a second surface of said support platform and having a distance extending radially from said centrally disposed recess; and said connecting portion is coupled to an actuator for providing movement for extending said lift-pins. 20. The processing chamber of claim 19 wherein said C-shaped lift-pin ring travels into said slot of said second surface of said support platform in a raised position, wherein said lift-pins are raised via said actuator pins.
