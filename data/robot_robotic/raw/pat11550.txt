A layer of carbon fiber materials sandwiched between two conductive layers provides a tactile feedback sensor which is particularly useful in manipulator systems for robotics and assembly automation.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A tactile sensor, especially for robot grasping manipulators, comprising: a carbon fiber layer; a first conductive layer disposed against a first side of said carbon layer; and a second conductive layer disposed against a second side of said carbon fiber layer, whereby pressure applied to said sensor reduces the electrical resistance between said first and second conductive layers. 2. The sensor of claim 1 further including electrical leads attached to each of said conductive layers. 3. The sensor of claim 2 in which said leads are disposed within said carbon fiber layer. 4. The sensor of claim 1 further including a resilient insulating layer disposed on at least one of said conductive layers, on the side of said conductive layer which is not in contact with said carbon fiber layer. 5. The sensor of claim 1 in which said first and second conductive layers are arranged in a checkerboard pattern so as to define a plurality of sensor elements. 6. The sensor of claim 1 in which said carbon fiber layer and said first and second conductive layers are configured as annular discs so as to form a washer-shaped sensor.
