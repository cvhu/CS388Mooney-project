Disclosed is an electro-optical and microcomputer based method and apparatus for automatically guiding tractors and other farm machinery for the purpose of automatic crop planting, tending and harvesting. A target is preferably located at one boundary of the field which serves as a reference. The position of the machinery in the field is determined by electro-optically sensing the target with a sensor located on the machinery. A desired trajectory for the machinery is then determined and the machinery is steered automatically along this trajectory.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for determining the distance of a base to, or the parallelism of a base having a direction of movement relative to, a row of objects located along an axis, comprising the steps of: projecting light at an oblique angle to the axis from the base located at one side of the axis so as to illuminate a limited plurality of objects in a row; imaging the light from the illuminated objects at a location on the base at an oblique angle different from the illuminating oblique angle; detecting the imaged light from the illuminated objects; generating a signal representative of the frequency of the images produced by said objects; and analyzing said signal to determine the distance to the row or the parallelism of the base relative to the row. 2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said projecting step includes the step of sequentially illuminating objects in the row at a known light projecting angle, and said imaging step includes the imaging of the returned light from the objects sequentially imaged at the known projection angle. 3. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said imaging step is performed using a TV camera; and further including the steps of moving the TV camera to view targets located at a known position and determining a position of the base relative to the targets.
