Contact lens molds and systems and methods for producing contact lens molds are described. The contact lens mold sections include two optical quality surfaces, a flange circumscribing at least a portion of the two optical quality surfaces, and an elongate member extending from the flange. Two mold sections can contact one another to form a mold assembly having a contact lens shaped cavity. The mold sections are structured to form a contact lens having an edge that does not require further physical modification before placement on an eye. Systems and methods are described which direct a molten polymeric material into cavities corresponding to the mold sections.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of producing a plurality of contact lenses having different prescriptions, comprising: producing a plurality of single piece contact lens mold sections in each of a number of mold cavities, each contact lens mold section comprises a lens defining region having a first lens-defining surface which is a negative of an optical quality anterior surface of a contact lens and has a first radius of curvature, a substantially opposing second lens-defining surface which is a negative of an optical quality posterior surface of a contact lens and has a second radius of curvature, a flange region circumscribing the first and second lens-defining surfaces; and using various combinations of the single piece contact lens mold sections to produce a plurality of contact lenses having a number of different prescriptions, wherein the number of different prescriptions of the plurality of contact lenses is equal to the square of the number of mold cavities. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein each mold cavity comprises a removable optical insert, and the number of different prescriptions for the plurality of contact lenses is obtained without removing the optical inserts.
