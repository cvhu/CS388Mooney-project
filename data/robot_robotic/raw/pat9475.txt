Systems and methods allow for the accurate determination of the terrestrial position of an autonomous vehicle in real time. A first position estimate of the vehicle 102 is derived from satellites of a global positioning system and/or a pseudolite(s). The pseudolite(s) may be used exclusively when the satellites are not in the view of the vehicle. A second position estimate is derived from an inertial reference unit and/or a vehicle odometer. The first and second position estimates are combined and filtered using novel techniques to derive a more accurate third position estimate of the vehicle's position. Accordingly, accurate autonomous navigation of the vehicle can be effectuated using the third position estimate.
Claims The following is claimed: 1. A system for improving the accuracy of a position estimate provided by a global positioning system based on pseudoranges derived from the global positioning system, the system comprising: first means for determining a plurality of pseudoranges for each of a plurality of satellites; in the global positioning system, said plurality of pseudoranges determined for each corresponding; satellite at consecutive times over a time period, wherein each pseudorange represents a distance between a reference antenna and a corresponding satellite in view of said reference antenna at a corresponding time; second means, responsive to said first means, for constructing a parabolic model for each satellite from said corresponding plurality of pseudoranges; third means, responsive to said first means and said second means, for computing a parabolic bias for each satellite from an extrapolated pseudorange determined from said parabolic: model and a future pseudorange derived after the time period; and fourth means, responsive to said third means, for using said parabolic bias for each satellite to improve the accuracy of the position estimates. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein said second means comprises means for constructing said parabolic model for each satellite from said corresponding plurality of pseudoranges using a statistical R squared value of 0.98 or greater. 3. A method for using parabolic models to improve an accuracy of a position estimate based on actual pseudoranges derived from satellites of a global positioning system, the method comprising the steps of: determining a plurality of actual pseudoranges corresponding to each of a plurality of satellites in view of a reference antenna; constructing, for each satellite, a parabolic model from said corresponding plurality of actual pseudoranges; extrapolating an estimated pseudorange for each satellite at a future time from said corresponding parabolic model; computing a parabolic bias for each satellite based on a corresponding actual pseudorange determined at said future time and a corresponding estimated pseudorange; and using said parabolic bias from each satellite to improve the accuracy of the position estimate. 4. A system for improving the accuracy of a position estimate based on pseudoranges derived from a global positioning system, the system comprising: first means for determining a plurality of reference pseudoranges corresponding to each satellite in view of a reference antenna at consecutive times over a time period, said plurality of reference pseudoranges each representing a distance between said reference antenna and a corresponding satellite over said time period; second means, responsive to said first means, for constructing a parabolic model for each satellite based on said corresponding plurality of reference pseudoranges; and third means, responsive to said first means and said second means, for computing a first spatial bias for each satellite, said spatial bias being a difference between an extrapolated pseudorange determined from said parabolic model and a future pseudorange derived after said the time period; fourth means, responsive to said first means, for computing an estimated position of said reference antenna using said plurality of reference pseudoranges; fifth means, responsive to said second means, for comparing said estimated position with a known position of said reference antenna to derive a second spatial bias; and sixth means for determining a position estimate of a user, for receiving said first and second spatial biases, and for using said first and second spatial biases to improve said terrestrial position estimates.
