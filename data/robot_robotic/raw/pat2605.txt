A Statechart for management of an interaction is generated automatically from a frame that describes the interaction by extracting a data model and a set of goals from frame and then generating a Statechart from the data model and the set of goals. The data model includes a set of data fields to be completed during the interaction Procedural logic is extracted from the frame and used to annotate the Statechart with, for example, initial and final rules, prompts and grammar. The Statechart may be stored for future use or editing, or used to manage a current interaction.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for automatic generation of a Statechart for management of an interaction, the system comprising: an input for receiving a frame that describes the interaction; and a processor operable to: extract a data model and a set of goals from the frame that, the data model comprising a set of data fields to be completed during the interaction; generate a Statechart from the data model and the set of goals; extract procedural logic from the frame; add the procedural logic to the Statechart; and an output for outputting the Statechart; wherein adding the procedural logic to the Statechart comprises, for each state of the Statechart: finding a goal of the set of goals that refers to the state; finding an unsatisfied atom within the goal; finding a field of the data model to which the goal atom refers; adding initial rules, prompts, and grammar for the field to the state as entry actions; and adding final rules for the field to the state as exit actions. 2. A system in accordance with claim 1 further comprising a memory for storing the Statechart. 3. A tangible, non-transitory computer-readable medium storing a program of instructions that, when executed on a processor, generate a Statechart for management of an interaction, the program of instructions comprising: instructions to extract a data model and a set of goals from a frame that, the data model comprising a set of data fields to be completed during the interaction; instructions to generate a Statechart from the data model and the set of goals; instructions to extract procedural logic from the frame; instructions to add the procedural logic to the Statechart; and instructions to output the Statechart wherein adding the procedural logic to the Statechart comprises, for each state of the Statechart: finding a goal of the set of goals that refers to the state; finding an unsatisfied atom within the goal; finding a field of the data model to which the goal atom refers; adding initial rules, prompts and grammar for the field to the state as entry actions; and adding final rules for the field to the state as exit actions. 4. A tangible, non-transitory computer-readable medium in accordance with claim 3 wherein generating a Statechart from the data model and the set of goals comprises: generating a set of states corresponding to completion states of the data model; generating an initial pseudo-state and a final state; generating a transition from the initial pseudo-state to an empty state of the set of states; generating transitions between each state of the set states and its subset states; removing outgoing transitions from any state of the set of states that satisfies at least one goal of the set of goals; and generating transitions to the final state from any state of the set of states that satisfies at least one goal of the set of goals.
