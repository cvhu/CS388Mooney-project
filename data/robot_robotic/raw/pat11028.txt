A torque-off collar having a circular driver section which can be gripped at any rotational angle by a torque tool, and a set of such collars of different size by having driver sections of equal size. A robot tool can randomly grasp such a collar, and can install any member of the set without making programatic provisions for collar size, or for angular alignment.
Claims I claim: 1. In a torque-off collar of the type which comprises: a unitary body having a central axis, a driven section, a driver section, and a shear section interconnecting said driven section and said driver section, an axial passage extending from end to end through said body, a first counterbore in the passage adjacent the free end of the driven section, an internally threaded portion in said driven section, and an unthreaded second counterbore at the free end of the driver section, in that order, said shear section constituting the region of least resistance to torque between the driver section and the free end of the driven section, the second counterbore extending through said driver section and through said shear section, the improvement comprising: a circular exterior surface on said driver section centered on said axis adapted to be gripped by a torque tool at any rotational angle around said axis, said exterior surface having a diameter. 2. A set of collars according to claim 1 having different internal thread diameters, and equal diameters on the respective said exterior surfaces. 3. A collar according to claim 1 in which said exterior surface is a cylinder. 4. In combination: a collar according to claim 1, and a torque tool adapted to grip said exterior surface and to exert torque on said driver section at said exterior surface. 5. In combination: a set of collars according to claim 2, and a torque tool adapted to grip said exterior surface and to exert torque on said driver section at said exterior surface.
