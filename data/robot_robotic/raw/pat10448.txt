An arrangement for solder-coating respective end portions of elongated components in a molten solder bath includes a fixture to be loaded with the components. This fixture includes at least one supporting wall that is capable of maintaining the fixture afloat in a predetermined position on an upper surface of the molten solder bath even when the fixture is fully loaded. The supporting wall has at least one opening through which one of the end portions of a respective component passes into the molten solder bath to a depth necessary for the molten solder to coat the respective end portion to the desired extent when the fixture floats in its predetermined position on the molten solder bath. The fixture may be used in conjunction with a handling device which advantageously includes two pin-shaped projections that engage the fixture at two locations spaced from one another along a horizontal axis with freedom of movement of the fixture relative to the projections at least in the upward direction in that the projections are received in respective vertical slots of the fixture. These projections are then moved at least downwardly to an extent necessary at least to lower the fixture onto the upper surface of the molten bath and then to release the fixture for free floating on the upper surface of the molten solder bath.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of solder-coating components in a molten solder bath, each component having a main body, a first end portion extending from the main body, and a second end portion extending from the main body in the opposite direction, comprising the steps of: loading the components into a fixture having a specific weight that is less than that of the molten bath, and having a first solid supporting wall with an opening therein such that the main body of each component rests on said first solid supporting wall and the first end portion of each component passes therethrough, said fixture also having a second solid supporting wall having an auxiliary opening therein such that the second end portion of each component passes therethrough, said first and second solid supporting wall are so connected to one having an auxiliary opening therein such that the second end portion of each component passes therethrough, said first and second solid supporting walls are so connected to one another such that said auxiliary opening is substantially aligned with said opening of said first supporting wall; placing said fixture onto the surface of the molten solder bath wherein surface tension effective between said first solid supporting wall and the molten solder bath keeps said fixture afloat on the surface of the molten solder bath to coat the first end portion of each component; and lifting said fixture from the molten solder bath; turning the fixture through 180.degree. about the horizontal axis such that the main body of each component slides in the vertical direction and rests on said second solid supporting wall; placing said fixture onto the surface of the molten solder bath wherein surface tension effective between said second solid supporting wall and the molten solder bath keeps said fixture afloat on the surface of the molten solder bath to coat the second end portion of each component; and lifting said fixture from the molten solder bath. 2. A method of solder-coating components in a molten solder bath, each component having a main body and a plurality of end portions all of which extend in the same direction from the main body, comprising the steps of: loading the components into a fixture having a specific weight that is less than that of the molten solder bath, and having a first solid supporting wall with an opening therein such that the main body of each component rests on said first solid supporting wall and the plurality of end portions of each component passes therethrough, said fixture also having a second solid supporting wall having an auxiliary opening therein such that the main body of additional components rests on said second solid supporting wall and the end portions of the additional components pass therethrough, and a partitioning wall arranged substantially midway between said first and second supporting walls abutting the components, wherein the components are loaded into said fixture between said first solid supporting wall and said partitioning wall, and the additional components are loaded between said second solid supporting wall and said partitioning wall; placing said fixture onto the surface of the molten solder bath wherein surface tension effective between said first solid supporting wall and the molten solder bath keeps said fixture afloat on the surface of the molten solder bath to coat the end portions of each component loaded between said first solid supporting wall and said partitioning wall; lifting said fixture from the molten solder bath; turning the fixture through 180.degree. about the horizontal axis such that the main body of the additional components rests on said second solid supporting wall; placing said fixture onto the surface of the molten solder bath wherein surface tension effective between said second solid supporting wall and the molten solder bath keeps the fixture afloat on the surface of the molten solder bath to coat the end portions of the additional components loaded between said second solid supporting wall and said partitioning wall; and lifting said fixture from the molten solder bath.
