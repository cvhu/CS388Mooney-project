A mobile device for traversing a ferromagnetic surface. The device includes a frame and at least one surface contacting device attached to the frame. The device also includes a Halbach magnet array attached to the frame, wherein the Halbach magnet array provides a magnetic force to maintain the surface contacting device substantially into contact with the ferromagnetic surface.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic device for operating on a ferromagnetic surface, comprising: a frame; a lifting/safety ring attached to the frame; a strain relief connector attached to the lifting/safety ring; at least one wheel attached to the frame, wherein the wheel has a polymeric coating on a surface that is configured to contact the ferromagnetic surface; and a Halbach magnet array attached to the frame, wherein the magnet array holds the wheel in substantially constant contact with the ferromagnetic surface and wherein the Halbach array is configured in use to be spaced from the ferromagnetic surface. 2. The device of claim 1, further comprising a motor attached to the frame. 3. The device of claim 1, wherein the Halbach magnet array includes a plurality of magnetic bars, and wherein the magnetic bars are arranged such that a magnetic force created by the array extends substantially toward the ferromagnetic surface. 4. The device of claim 1, further comprising a steering system attached to the frame. 5. The device of claim 1, further comprising an actuation device attached to the frame.
