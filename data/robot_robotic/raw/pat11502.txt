A robot arm attachment tool for handling workpieces, such as information recording disks. The tool is self aligning, has enhanced load handling load capacities and is able to handle workpieces having sensitive surfaces without damage to same. The tool is attached to the robot arm so as to allow the main portion of the tool to translate freely in a horizontal plane and to freely pivot about a center axis of the tool. The tool centers itself over a workpiece to be lifted, and has a pressurizable chamber having a piston for allowing powered removal of workpieces which is connected to housings which in turn engage workpieces to be lifted. In operation, the robot arm first generally centers and lowers the tool over the workpiece. The tool then precisely centers itself over the workpiece. The free attachment of the tool allows the tool to tilt and translate in a horizontal plane as the tool comes in contact with the workpiece, for a precise fit. Once the tool has fully engaged the workpiece, the robot arm senses the stop motion, and stops. At this point a negative pressure system is activated securely fastening the workpiece to the tool. The chamber is then pressurized, causing the housing to rise relative to the piston raising the workpiece off its mounting structure. Once the workpiece has cleared the mounting structure, the robot arm is activated and the workpiece moved to the new location.
