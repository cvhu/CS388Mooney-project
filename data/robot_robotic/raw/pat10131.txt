A pre-injection sample sequencing subsystem for laboratory apparatus which includes a chromatograph with a column includes a circular tray with a plurality of concentric arrays of physical locations for storing sample vials in radially extending linear arrays, and a plurality of virtual locations that are extensions of the linear arrays. Each of the physical and virtual locations are individually addressable by a controller for a robot on the tray such that pre-injection sample processing modules may be attached to the tray, located at one or more of the virtual locations. A sequencing method optimizes transfer of samples contained in the vials between their respective physical storage location and the pre-injection processing modules.

The method according to claim 3, wherein said controlling step comprises the steps of: (a) assigning a unique address to each one of the physical and virtual locations of said holding means; (b) instructing said robot means to retrieve a selected sample from its respective physical location; (c) retrieving said selected sample with said robot means; (d) instructing said robot means to transfer said selected sample from its respective physical location to the processing means; (e) transferring said selected sample with said robot means to the processing means; (f) instructing the processing means to conduct at least two pre-injection processing steps upon said selected sample; (g) conducting one of said at least two pre-injection processing steps upon said selected sample with the processing means; (h) conducting other ones of said at least two pre-injection processing steps upon said selected sample with the processing means; (i) instructing said robotic means to retrieve another selected sample from its respective physical location; (j) retrieving said other selected sample with said robot means during the conduct of said other pre-injection processing steps on a previously selected sample; (k) instructing said robot means to transfer said other selected sample to the processing means; (l) transferring said other selected sample with said robot means to the processing means during the conduct of said other pre-injection processing steps on said previously selected sample; (m) instructing said robot means to retrieve said previously selected sample from the processing means upon completion of said other pre-injection processing steps; (n) retrieving said previously selected sample with said robot means from the processing means upon completion of said at least two pre-injection processing steps; (o) instructing said robot means to transfer said previously selected sample to said virtual location of said holding means that corresponds to said at least one of said physical storage locations of said circular array in said rotary transfer means; (p) transferring said previously selected sample with said robot means to said virtual location of said holding means that corresponds to said at least one of said physical storage locations of said circular array in said rotary transfer means; (q) instructing said rotary transfer means to transfer said previously selected sample to the sample port; (r) instructing the on-column means to withdraw said previously selected sample from its vial; (s) instructing the on-column means to inject said withdrawn sample into the column through the sample port; and (t) repeating steps (f) through (s) for said other selected sample. 5. The method according to claim 4, further comprising the steps of: identifying each said selected sample; instructing said robot means to transfer said selected sample to the processing means by communication of its unique address; rotating said arm about said central axis to align said hand with the particular one of said linear arrays that corresponds to said selected sample; extending said hand to said physical location of said holding means that corresponds to said selected sample; grasping said selected sample with said hand; and verifying the identity of each said selected sample prior to its transfer to the processing means. 6. A method of sequencing one or more samples in an analytical apparatus, wherein the analytical apparatus comprises: (a) a chromatograph that includes a sample port; and (b) a pre-injection sample processing means for processing preselected ones of the one or more samples, the method comprising the steps of: transferring a vial using a robot means; controlling the robotic system to transfer at least one of the samples to a tray that includes a plurality of physical locations for storing samples; defining a plurality of virtual locations outside the tray that include at least one of the pre-injection sample processing means and the sample port; controlling the robotic system to selectively transfer a first sample to one of the virtual locations; and controlling the robotic system to optimize transferring a plurality of vials between their respective physical location and the virtual locations, whereby a second vial is transferred while a first vial is disposed in a virtual location. 7. The method of claim 6 wherein the steps of transferring at least one of the vials to one of the virtual locations comprises programming a controller for controlling a manipulator.
