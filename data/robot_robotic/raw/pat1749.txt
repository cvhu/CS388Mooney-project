One of the embodiments of the invention includes a method of identifying illegal uses of copyright material. The steps of the method preferably include the steps of: (a) providing a primary digital media object, (b) associating an auxiliary construct with the object, (c) transforming the construct using at least one of the attributes of the object to generate a unique key representative of the primary object, (d) receiving a plurality of secondary digital media objects, (e) performing steps (b) and (c) on the secondary objects to generate unique keys representative of the secondary objects, (f) comparing the keys of the secondary objects with the key of the primary object to identify if any of the secondary objects are substantially similar to the primary object.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of identifying illegal uses of copyright material, comprising the steps of: the following steps to be performed by a first computer: receiving a primary digital media object; associating a first auxiliary construct with the primary digital media object; and transforming the first auxiliary construct using at least one of the attributes of the primary digital media object to generate a unique key representative of the primary digital media object; the following steps to be performed by a second computer: receiving a secondary digital media object; associating a second auxiliary construct with the secondary digital media object; and transforming the second auxiliary construct using at least one of the attributes of the secondary digital media object to generate a unique key representative of the secondary digital media object; accessing the unique key representative of the primary digital media object from the first computer; and comparing the keys of the secondary object with the key of the primary object to identify if the secondary object is substantially similar to the primary object.
