Provided are hydrolases, including lipases, saturases, palmitases and/or stearatases, and polynucleotides encoding them, and methods of making and using these polynucleotides and polypeptides. Further provided are polypeptides, e.g., enzymes, having a hydrolase activity, e.g., lipases, saturases, palmitases and/or stearatases and methods for preparing low saturate or low trans fat oils, such as low saturate or low trans fat animal or vegetable oils, e.g., soy or canola oils.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for biocatalytic synthesis of a structured lipid comprising the following steps: (a) providing a polypeptide having a palmitase activity, said polypeptide being selected from the group consisting of isolated, synthetic and recombinant polypeptides having a palmitase activity and said polypeptide either i. being encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein the nucleic acid encodes at least one polypeptide having palmitase activity and the polypeptide having at least one amino acid residue change recited below in Table A, or ii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and having at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A, TABLE-US-00014 TABLE A Amino Original New Acid Amino Amino Residue Acid Acid 27 G Q 45 G L 54 S H 61 D A E 62 V A G 72 R E K S T 74 F I 83 V M 96 A I 98 G L 116 E A F H L Q Q R, H140R R S S T V 117 L R, I161L 120 K L 133 S A 147 I F 151 I A G H 160 P T 172 R Q 212 S R 213 K T 214 T V N R Y 215 G A H 216 A V C L or iii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length of SEQ ID NO:2 and comprising at least one amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R (b) providing a composition comprising a triacylglyceride; (c) contacting the polypeptide of step (a) with the composition of step (b) under conditions wherein the polypeptide hydrolyzes a palmitic acid residue at the Sn2 position of the triacylglyceride, thereby producing a 1,3-diacylglyceride; (d) providing an R1 ester, wherein the R1 ester comprises a fatty acid of lower saturation than said hydrolyzed palmitic acid residue; (e) providing an R1-specific hydrolase, and (f) contacting the 1,3-diacylglyceride of step (c) with the R1 ester of step (d) and the R1-specific hydrolase of step (e) under conditions wherein the R1-specific hydrolase catalyzes esterification of the Sn2 position, thereby producing the structured lipid. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the R1-specific hydrolase is an Sn2-specific lipase. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the structured lipid is selected from the group consisting of a cocoa butter alternative, a synthetic cocoa butter, a natural cocoa butter, 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol, 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoylglycerol, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoylglycerol and 1-oleoyl-2,3-dimyristoylglycerol. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said R1 ester comprises one or more of an omega-3 fatty acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, or a mono-unsaturated fatty acid. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein said R1 ester comprises a moiety selected from the group consisting of alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and palmitoleic acid. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein said synthesized structured lipid has a lower saturated fat content than said triacylglyceride. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein said synthesized structured lipid has a lower trans fat content than said triacylglyceride. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and has at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2 and further comprises at least one of amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2 and further comprises at least one of amino acid residue modification I20L; V62S; G77P; V83C; D88H; Y113G; E116T; E116G; H140K; K146S; I167S; L180E; E194M; A211Q; S212Y; G215C; G215V; G215W; A218H; A218S; V223A; A225M; or A225Q.
