A chip breaker drill bushing is provided for a metal drilling apparatus. The bushing has a central channel through which a drill bit or drilling tool extends and rotates. The bushing is shaped at the workpiece end to collect metal offal carried up by the drill. Angled troughs guide the offal up and away from the workpiece and cutting edges on the end of the bushing chop the strands into small, easily handled chips.
Claims I claim: 1. A bushing 2 for a drilling apparatus comprising a guide shaft 8 having a drill channel 22 there through and a plurality of cutting or breaking teeth 28 in the nose 24 of said shaft 8, each said tooth having a slanted trough side 26, a cutting edge 39, a substantially vertical side 30, and an open notch 38 at the junction of each said trough side 26 and vertical side 30, such that long strands of metal created by drilling are cut or broken into smaller pieces by said teeth 28. 2. A bushing 2 for a drilling apparatus comprising a guide shaft 8 having a drill channel 22 there through, a drill having a plurality of flutes located in said channel 22, at least as many cutting teeth 28 as said flutes in the nose 24 of said shaft 8, each said tooth having a slanted trough side 26, a cutting edge, a substantially vertical side 30, and an open notch 38 at the junction of each said trough side 26 and substantially vertical side 30, such that long strands of metal created by drilling are cut between said bushing and workpiece into smaller pieces by said teeth 28. 3. The bushing of claim 1 having four said cutting or breaking teeth. 4. The bushing of claim 1 further characterized by a beveled edge 32 on said nose 24.
