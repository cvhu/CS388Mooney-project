A method of forming a multiwell filtration plate comprising of first gluing a filter to a major surface of a multiwell plate so as to close off one entrance to the wells of the plate. The filter is then heat sealed so as to collapse the pores of the filter in the area between the wells so as to prevent lateral migration of fluid from one well to another.
