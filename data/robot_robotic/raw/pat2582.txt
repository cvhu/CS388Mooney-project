The vehicle (10) includes a frame (12) having at least three non-circular wheels (20, 22, 24) secured to a frame (12), wherein the wheels are mechanically secured to each other so that whenever one non-circular wheel moves, the other wheels (20, 22, 24) move. An offset arm (76) powered by a motor (78) rotates a weight (84) around a geometric center adjacent the wheels to sequentially tip them so that their sequential tipping moves the vehicle (10). The non-circular wheels (20, 22, 24) are sequentially aligned with respect to each other so that whenever one wheel is tipped from a collapse alignment (32) into a contact alignment (34), sequentially the next non-circular wheel (20, 22, 24) is moved into a collapse alignment (32). Any driving force may be used to sequentially tip the non-circular wheels (20, 22, 24, 26), instead of the rotating weight (84).
