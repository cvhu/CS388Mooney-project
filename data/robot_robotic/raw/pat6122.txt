The present invention relates, in general, to a process of enzymatically synthesizing nucleic acids containing nucleotides that are resistant to degradation. The invention further relates to methods of utilizing such nucleic acids in DNA and RNA amplification and sequencing, gene therapy and molecular detection protocols.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of producing a protein comprising introducing into a cell a nucleic acid sequence encoding said protein, which nucleic acid sequence comprises a boronated nucleotide, said introduction being effected under conditions such that said nucleic acid sequence is expressed and said protein thereby produced. 2. A method of producing a protein comprising expressing a nucleic acid sequence encoding said protein, which nucleic acid sequence comprises a boronated nucleotide, said expression being effected under conditions such that said protein is produced.
