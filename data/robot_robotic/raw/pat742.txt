Rotary to linear and linear to rotary motion conversion devices that consist of rotational elements, at least two flexible linking elements, and motion elements are disclosed. Rotary elements and motion elements are connected by the flexible linking members, which twist around each other when rotational elements rotate and thus produce pulling force on the motion elements. A methodology to design the motion conversion devices and robotic joints incorporating the motion conversion devices are disclosed.
Claims I claim: 1. A rotary to linear or rotary to linear motion conversion device comprising two sets of at least two flexible linking members, a rotational element to which, on one side one of said two sets of said flexible linking members has ends connected at the center of rotation of said rotational element and, on the other side, the other of said two sets of said flexible linking members has ends connected at the center of rotation of said rotational element, a pair of motion elements which are at distance away from said rotational element in the direction of a rotational axis of said rotational element on both sides of said rotational element and are linked by means of stiff or compliant member and are movable primarily in the direction of said rotational axis of said rotational element and are supported by means that prevent rotation around said rotational axis of said rotational element and to which each said set of said flexible linking members have the other ends connected at locations that are spaced equally from said rotational axis of said rotational element at distance A, which is larger than thickness radius R and smaller than length L of said flexible linking members, allowing said two sets of said flexible linking members to twist around each other or untwist depending on the direction of rotation of said rotational element causing the relative distance between said rotational element and said pair of motion elements to vary, and having one of said two sets of said flexible linking members twisted in-advance around each other and said flexible linking members of the other of said two sets of said flexible linking members not twisted around each other in advance so that said in-advance non-twisted flexible linking members are twisted around each other when said rotational element is rotated in the direction to untwist said in-advance twisted flexible linking members and in this way convert a rotation of said rotational element into a relative motion of said pair of motion elements and said rotational element primarily in the direction of said rotational axis of said rotational element and convert a rotational torque on said rotational element into a pulling force on said pair of motion elements primarily in the direction of said rotational axis of said rotational element or convert a motion of said pair of motion elements primarily in the direction of said rotational axis of said rotational element into a rotation of said rotational element and convert a pulling force on said pair of motion elements primarily in the direction of said rotational axis of said rotational element into a rotational torque on said rotational element. 2. The motion conversion device of claim 1 in which sensing means to detect a rotational angle of said rotational element, sensing means to detect a motion of said motion elements, sensing means to detect a rotational torque on said rotational element, sensing means to detect a pulling force on said motion elements, means to control a relative or an absolute position or a speed or a rotational torque or a pulling force are employed in any combination of said sensing means and said control means on said rotational element and said motion elements.
