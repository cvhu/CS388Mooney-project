An autonomous underwater vehicle system for ocean science measurement and reconnaissance is about six feet long and 13 inches in diameter and includes various improvements which make turn-key, networkable, autonomous or tethered operation in aquatic environments possible. The improvements include a platform independent computer and I/O architecture which permits use of CISC or RISC CPUs and turn-key vehicle operation by persons unversed in computer programming, a floating launch and recovery frame which protects the vehicle and also provides for correct and safe vehicle assembly, an external battery charging port and high speed serial port with provision for optional control of the vehicle and data acquisition in real-time through connection of a lightweight electrically conducting tether, a four part hull assembly including an integrated strobe and antennae tower on the forward hull section which emerges from the water when the vehicle is at the surface, a modular, removable nose cone to carry sensors, and a motor mount which protects the main hull from flooding in the event of thruster failure, and flexible control surfaces with dive planes located on the forward hull and rudder fins on the stern hull section. These features are combined to produce a versatile and flexible platform for making oceanographic observations during complex behaviors executed by the vehicle and for providing duplex computer network connections when the vehicle is at the surface.
Claims What is claimed as new and desired to be secured by Letters Patent of the United States is: 1. A modular autonomous underwater vehicle system having a vehicle and launch and recovery frame assembly comprising: a removable nose cone adapted for mounting standard or custom sensors; a plurality of sensors mounted in said nose cone; a pressure forward hull section, connected to said nose cone, and having internal mounting for a navigation and data collection computer, for a power supply, and for dive plane actuator mechanisms; a pressure aft hull section, connected to said forward hull section and having internal mounting for a power supply, for a power control module, and for rudder actuator mechanisms; a motor mount section, connected to but pressure isolated from, said pressure aft hull, containing electrical drive motor and associated electrical connections; a strobe and antennae tower containing packet modem antenna, GPS antenna, and high intensity strobe light; a packet modem and GPS receiver module located inside said forward hull; a plurality of batteries mounted inside said forward hull section; a navigation and data collection computer mounted inside said forward hull section; dive planes located on and extending horizontally from both sides of said forward hull section; rudder fins located on and extending vertically from both sides of said aft hull section; a DC thruster motor mounted in said motor mount section; a battery charging port and high speed serial port located on said motor mount section; an array of interconnected internal components comprising four stepping motors, one for each of said dive planes and rudder fins located in the forward and aft hulls, respectively, an I/O block, located on said forward hull, for connection to said sensors located in the nose cone or elsewhere in the vehicle; and a floating launch and recovery frame, attachable to said vehicle, for assembling and launching said underwater vehicle. 2. A modular autonomous underwater vehicle system as in claim 1 wherein said computer has I/O architecture having platform independence, thereby allowing substitution of a variety of CPUs. 3. A modular autonomous underwater vehicle system as in claim 2 wherein said computer has a plurality of analog-to-digital converter channels and digital I/O channels and at least one digital-to-analog output channel. 4. A modular autonomous underwater vehicle system as in claim 3 wherein said computer I/O architecture has a graphical operator interface. 5. A modular autonomous underwater vehicle system as in claim 4 wherein said I/O architecture is a layered software structure providing a finite state machine. 6. A self-contained modular autonomous underwater vehicle system having a method for profiling a water column comprising the steps of: ascertaining location of the vehicle at the surface; proceeding to the user specified dive location; descending in a spiraling fashion to the target depth while collecting data; ascending to the surface in a spiraling fashion while collecting data; periodically ascertaining drift from the dive location and reporting vehicle and mission status; assessing reliability of vehicle sensors; returning to the pickup location after the mission; and holding station at the pickup location while broadcasting vehicle status sequencing the normal states of AUV operation to accomplish the desired mission; defining the error states of AUV operation which interfere with mission completion; providing corrective actions for each error state; and linking the preceding states as a finite state machine. 7. A self-contained modular autonomous underwater vehicle system as in claim 6 wherein said step of defining the error states further comprises: ascertaining locomotion systems failure; detecting entanglement; detecting collisions with the bottom or objects in the water column or at the surface; and assessing reliability of vehicle sensors. 8. A self-contained modular autonomous underwater vehicle system as in claim 6 wherein said step of providing corrective actions further comprises: broadcasting messages of vehicle distress and location; illuminating the high intensity strobe; initiating unpowered ascents when appropriate; initiating disentanglement maneuvers; and avoiding collision with the bottom or objects.
