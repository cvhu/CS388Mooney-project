The present invention makes it possible and easier to serve optimum robot components/devices/accessories by means of an information service system including personal terminal devices (31A to 31C) connected to an information communication network via a telecommunication line, and a server (38) connected to the information communication network via the telecommunication line to cumulatively store information on components/devices/accessories available from a plurality of manufacturers (37a, 37c and 37c) (third party) of components/devices/accessories of a robot 1, as classified according to the attributes of the components/devices/accessories and send, to the personal terminal devices (31A to 31C) connected thereto, options information prepared based on the attribute of the cumulatively stored components/devices/accessories information and including a plurality of items for selection of a robot component.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An information server comprising: first storage means, external to a robotic device, storing robot-related information related to a plurality of replaceable components/devices/accessories that comprise the robotic device; second storage means, external to the robotic device, storing information about components/devices/accessories that are compatible replacements for the components/devices/accessories that comprise the robotic device; and means for reading the robot-related information from the first storage means and selecting one or more compatible components/devices/accessories from the second storage means, wherein the server prepares options information on one or more compatible components/devices/accessories and sends the options information to a user terminal remote from the server. 2. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the robot-related information includes information on types of robotic devices in which at least the compatible components/devices/accessories in consideration can be used. 3. The apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the predetermined piece of components/devices/accessories information concerns compatible components/devices/accessories usable in the robotic device.
