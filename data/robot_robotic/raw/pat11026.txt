A parts manipulator formed by a head and a robot (10) for attachment to a robot arm and rotatable therewith, the head including a rotatable mount (26) attached to the robot arm (19) and a plurality of gripper mechanisms (21) secured about the mount (26). Each gripper mechanism includes a set of finger portions (51), each selectively and independently of each other shiftable between first and second orientations on the mount to extend either parallel to and downwardly from, or outwardly from the mount (26), allowing flexibly programmed handling of a part.
Claims I claim: 1. A parts manipulator comprising: a part positioning device (10) having movable portions (18, 19, 25) and carrying a gripper mount (26) attached to one (25) of said movable portions of said part positioning device (10); a plurality of gripper mechanisms (21) mounted about said gripper mount (26); each of said gripper mechanisms (21) including a set of relatively movable opposed gripper finger portions (51) and means (60,61,62,64,65) for selectively moving said gripper finger portions (51) together so as to enable said gripper mechanism (21) to grip a part; a plurality of mounting means, (37,50) each mounting a set of said gripper finger portions (51) of a respective one of said gripper mechanisms (21) to be shiftable as a set about a horizontal axis relative to said mount (26) between a first upper orientation and a second lower orientation, said gripper finger portions (51) in said first orientation directed in another direction than when in said second orientation; actuation means (42) associated with each of said gripper mechanisms (21) operable to enable each set of said finger portions (51) to be shifted between said first and second orientations independently of each other, whereby the finger portions (51) of any selected one of said plurality of gripper mechanisms (21) may be positioned in either said first or second orientations for handling of a part upon actuation by said actuation means (42). 2. The parts manipulator according to claim 1 wherein said mounting means (37,50) comprises a pivotal mounting (37) of said gripper finger portions (51) to be swingable between said first orientation in which said finger portions (51) are directed outwardly from said mount (26) and said second orientation in which said finger portions (51) extend downwardly from said mount (26). 3. The parts manipulator according to claim 2 further including downwardly facing camera lens means (72) centrally located between said plurality of gripper mechanisms (21), positioned to view the space adjacent any of said gripper finger portions (51) when shifted to said second orientation. 4. The parts manipulator according to claim 1 wherein a plurality of pairs of gripper mechanisms (21) are arrayed about said mount (26) in oppositely positioned pairs. 5. The parts manipulator according to claim 1 wherein said actuation means (60) includes selectively activated means (42) associated with each of said gripper mechanisms (21) urging said associated finger portions (51) to said second orientation, and further including retraction means causing said associated gripper finger portions (51) to shift to said first orientation whenever said gripper finger portions (51) are not urged to said second orientation. 6. The parts manipulator according to claim 2 wherein said mount (26) is rotatable about a vertical axis, and said mounting means (37,50) orients each of said gripper finger portions (51) to extend generally parallel to said vertical axis of rotation in said second orientation and normally to said vertical axis of rotation in said first orientation. 7. The parts manipulator according to claim 6 wherein each of said gripper finger portions (51) are pivotably mounted by its respective mounting means (37,50) to be swingable from said second orientation parallel to said axis of rotation of said mount (26) to said first orientation extending outwardly from said axis of rotation of said mount (26).
