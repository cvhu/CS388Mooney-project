A system and method for positioning a medical instrument at a desired biological target tissue site is provided. The system includes an elongated sheath having a deflectable distal end configured to deflect or otherwise position at least a portion of a medical instrument during a surgical procedure allowing for the placement of the deflected portion adjacent or proximate to a predetermined target tissue surface. The positioning system may be incorporated into the medical instrument. The medical instrument may be an ablation system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of positioning a medical instrument within a patient's body using a guide sheath having a sharp tip at a deflectable distal end during a surgical procedure, comprising the steps of: introducing into the patient's body the guide sheath having the deflectable distal end and having a longitudinal axis and at least one lumen passing therethrough that is aligned along the longitudinal axis near the distal end; dissecting tissue with the sharp tip; deflecting the deflectable distal end of the sheath within the patient's body; introducing the medical instrument into the guide sheath positioned within the patient's body toward a target tissue site; and advancing the distal end of the medical instrument through the at least one lumen to the deflectable distal end thereof for positioning at least a portion of the medical instrument within the deflected distal end of the guide sheath near the target tissue site. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein deflecting the deflectable distal end includes deflecting by an angular amount skewed from the longitudinal axis of about 180.degree.. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein dissecting tissue comprises advancing the sharp tip to extend distally past the deflectable distal end. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the medical instrument includes a tissue-ablating element and the method further comprises positioning the tissue-ablating element within the deflectable distal end.
