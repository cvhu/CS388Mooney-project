A gripper assembly for a robotic device includes a first vacuum nozzle (260) having a gripping surface (262), and a second vacuum nozzle (270) having a gripping surface (272). The first nozzle (260) is positioned within the second nozzle (270).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A vacuum gripper assembly for a robotic device, comprising: a first vacuum nozzle having a gripping surface; a second vacuum nozzle having a gripping surface, the first nozzle being movably positioned within the second nozzle, the first and second nozzles having a common central axis extending longitudinally through the first and second nozzles, the gripping surface of the first nozzle being selectively retractable behind and extendible beyond the gripping surface of the second nozzle: a third vacuum nozzle having a gripping surface, the second nozzle being movably positioned within the third nozzle, the third nozzle sharing the common central axis of the first and second nozzles, the gripping surface of the second nozzle being selectively retractable behind and extendible beyond the gripping surface of the third nozzle; a first flange mechanically coupled to the first nozzle; a second flange mechanically coupled to the second nozzle; means mechanically coupled to the first flange for moving the first nozzle; and means mechanically coupled to the second flange for moving the second nozzle and for causing a corresponding movement of the first nozzle. 2. The gripper assembly of claim 1, wherein: the first nozzle has a first travel range with respect to the second nozzle along the common central axis; and the second nozzle has a second travel range with respect to the third nozzle along the common central axis, the second travel range being substantially equal to the first travel range. 3. The gripper assembly of claim 1, further comprising: a vacuum port coupled to the first vacuum nozzle; and a vacuum source coupled to the vacuum port, the vacuum source selectively providing vacuum pressure through the vacuum port to the first, second, and third nozzles when each nozzle is selectively extended.
