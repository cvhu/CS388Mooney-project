A transfer robot comprises a carriage mounted headstock assembly, a main support disk mounted to the rotatable spindle of a headstock, an extention slide mounted to the support disk for motion transverse to the spindle, and a carrying fixture mounted to the outer end of the slide and having adjustable sets of spaced apart gripping arms for gripping and carrying a cylindrical tire carcass. A counterweight on the disk offsets the outboard weight of the extended slide and carrying fixture, and a carcass carried thereon, on the headstock spindle and its bearings. The robot is powered by programmable devices which sequence its operation to grasp and carry a carcass by its bead areas from a carcass supply station, in an arc, into alignment with the axis of a tire building drum, then the carcass is moved axially of that drum and located around it, after which the gripping arms release and retract, and the fixture is moved to a parked position.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A transfer robot used in combination with a first stage carcass supply station and a second stage tire building drum for carrying a cylindrical tire carcass from a first position located on the carcass supply station to a second position located on the tire building drum, the combination comprising: a tire building drum mounted such that its axis of rotation is horizontal, said drum having an end over which a carcass can be loaded onto said drum; a carcass supply station supplying cylindrical tire carcasses having bead areas at their ends, wherein each said carcass is supplied with its longitudinal axis horizontal and in predetermined alignment with the axis of rotation of the tire building drum; a robot located between the carcass supply station and the tire building drum; said robot comprising, a track means extending parallel with the axis of rotation of said tire building drum, a carriage movable along said track means, a headstock mounted on said carriage, a rotatable spindle supported in said headstock on an axis of rotation parallel with the axis of rotation of said tire building drum, a main support member attached to and rotatable with said spindle, a guide extending outwardly on said main support member to one side of said spindle, slide means movable along said guide toward and away from the axis of rotation of said spindle, a carcass carrying fixture connected to said slide means, gripping means on said fixture for gripping a carcass at its bead areas, said gripping means comprising two sets of opposing gripping arms and means supporting said gripping arms for movement toward and away from each other to grip or release a carcass, means for rotating said spindle to swing said gripping means with a carcass therein from the first position to a position axially displaced from and coaxial with said tire building drum, means for moving said carriage to carry a carcass so aligned with said tire building drum along the axis of rotation of said drum over said end of said drum and into the second position around said drum, and means for releasing said gripping means from the carcass at the second position and retracting said gripping means toward said spindle leaving the carcass deposited on said tire building drum. 2. The combination defined in claim 1, further including counterbalance means incorporated in said support member for counterbalancing the extended carrying fixture and a carcass gripped therein. 3. The combination defined in claim 1, further including means for adjusting the spatial distance between said sets of gripping arms.
