A system for sensing and communicating in a pipeline that contains a fluid. An acoustic signal containing information about a property of the fluid is produced in the pipeline. The signal is transmitted through the pipeline. The signal is received with the information and used by a control.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An apparatus for providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in an existing buried water pipeline without excavation wherein water is in the water pipeline and wherein a fire hydrant is connected to the existing buried water pipeline, comprising: a discrete sensor unit that senses at least one property of the fluid to provide a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination and produces in the water pipeline a warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination related to said property, said property comprising a biological property or a chemical property, means for introducing said discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through the fire hydrant, a discrete receiver unit for receiving said warning signal related to said property, means for introducing said discrete receiver unit into the water pipeline through the fire hydrant, a control, said control producing an output function that provides a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination, and a communication system for transmission of said signal related to said property warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination, said communication system transmitting said signal related to said property warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination from said receiver to said control. 2. The apparatus for providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in an existing buried water pipeline without excavation of claim 1 wherein said means for introducing said discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through the fire hydrant is a tether that is attached to said discrete sensor unit and that extends through the fire hydrant. 3. The apparatus for providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in an existing buried water pipeline without excavation of claim 1 wherein said means for introducing said discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through the fire hydrant is a tether comprised of a flattened tape of metal, a steel cable, or a polymer cable that is attached to said discrete sensor unit and that extends through the fire hydrant. 4. The apparatus for providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in an existing buried water pipeline without excavation of claim 1 wherein said discrete sensor unit produces acoustic pulses with time between acoustic pulses and wherein said warning signal relating to said property is related to said time between said acoustic pulses. 5. A method of providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in an existing buried water pipeline containing water, wherein a fire hydrant is connected to the existing buried water pipeline, comprising the steps of: providing a discrete sensor unit for sensing information about at least one property of the water, said at least one property comprising a biological property or a chemical property that indicates unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water, wherein said discrete sensor unit produces a warning signal upon sensing the unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water; introducing said discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through the fire hydrant; producing an acoustic warning signal in the water in the water pipeline containing said warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water; transmitting said warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water through the water in the water pipeline; providing a discrete receiver unit for receiving said warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water; introducing said discrete receiver unit into the water pipeline through the fire hydrant; receiving said warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water from the water in the water pipeline; communicating said warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water from said discrete receiver unit to a control; and using said control for taking action based upon said warning signal of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination of the water. 6. The method of providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in a an existing buried water pipeline of claim 5 wherein said step of introducing said discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through a fire hydrant includes using a tether to introduce discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through a fire hydrant. 7. The method of providing a warning of unauthorized contamination or accidental contamination by sensing and communicating in an existing buried water pipeline of claim 5 wherein said step of introducing said discrete sensor into the water pipeline through a fire hydrant includes using a tether comprised of a flattened tape of metal, a steel cable, or a polymer cable to introduce said discrete sensor unit into the water pipeline through a fire hydrant.
