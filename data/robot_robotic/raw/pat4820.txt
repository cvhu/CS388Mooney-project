Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 22, 23, 24 or 25 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding STAT5A (SEQ ID NO: 4) or STAT5B (SEQ ID NO: 151), wherein said compound has at least 80% identity with SEQ ID NO: 36. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is 18, 19,20, 21 or 22 nucleobases in length and has at least 90% identity with SEQ ID NO: 36. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 which is 19, 20 or 21 nucleobases in length and has at least 95% identity with SEQ ID NO: 36. 4. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is a chimeric antisense compound. 5. The antisense compound of claim 1 comprising at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety, or nucleobase. 6. The antisense compound of claim 1 comprising at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 1 comprising at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 8. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein at least one cytosine is a 5-methylcytosine.
