Provided are hydrolases, including lipases, saturases, palmitases and/or stearatases, and polynucleotides encoding them, and methods of making and using these polynucleotides and polypeptides. Further provided are polypeptides, e.g., enzymes, having a hydrolase activity, e.g., lipases, saturases, palmitases and/or stearatases and methods for preparing low saturate or low trans fat oils, such as low saturate or low trans fat animal or vegetable oils, e.g., soy or canola oils.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An interesterification method for preparing a food, feed or an oil comprising the following steps: (a) providing an interesterification reaction mixture comprising a stearic acid source material selected from the group consisting of stearic acid, stearic acid monoesters of low molecular weight monohydric alcohols and mixtures thereof, (b) providing a food, feed or an oil containing a triacylglyceride; (c) providing a polypeptide having a palmitase activity, said polypeptide being selected from the group consisting of isolated, synthetic and recombinant polypeptides having a palmitase activity and said polypeptide either i. being encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein the nucleic acid encodes at least one polypeptide having palmitase activity and the polypeptide having at least one amino acid residue change recited below in Table A, or ii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and having at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A, TABLE-US-00014 TABLE A Amino Original New Acid Amino Amino Residue Acid Acid 27 G Q 45 G L 54 S H 61 D A E 62 V A G 72 R E K S T 74 F I 83 V M 96 A I 98 G L 116 E A F H L Q Q R, H140R R S S T V 117 L R, I161L 120 K L 133 S A 147 I F 151 I A G H 160 P T 172 R Q 212 S R 213 K T 214 T V N R Y 215 G A H 216 A V C L or iii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length of SEQ ID NO:2 and comprising at least one amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R (d) interesterifying the stearic acid source material and the triacylglyceride of the food, feed, or oil, and (e) separating free fatty acid components from interesterified glyceride components of the interesterification mixture to provide an interesterified oil product and a fatty acid mixture comprising fatty acids, fatty acid monoesters, or mixtures thereof released from the food, feed or oil. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said interesterification reaction is continued until there is substantial equilibration of the ester groups in the 1-, 3-positions of the glyceride component with non-glyceride fatty acid components of the reaction mixture. 3. The method of claim 1, comprising a further step of hydrogenating the fatty acid mixture. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said interesterified triacylglycerides have a lower trans fat content than said triacylglycerides of step (b). 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and has at least one amino acid residue change. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2 and further comprises at least one of amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2 and further comprises at least one of amino acid residue modification I20L; V62S; G77P; V83C; D88H; Y113G; E116T; E116G; H140K; K146S; I167S; L180E; E194M; A211Q; S212Y; G215C; G215V; G215W; A218H; A218S; V223A; A225M; or A225Q.
