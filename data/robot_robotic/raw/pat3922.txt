The invention is a quick connect coupling apparatus in the form of a test module for use in a robotic work performing application which accomplishes testing of an end effector in an offline location such that the integrity of each pneumatic circuit can be independently verified and any pneumatic components found leaking may be replaced at the offline location rather than result in downtime during production use.
