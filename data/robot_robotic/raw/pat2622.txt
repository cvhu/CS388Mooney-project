A printhead assembly for use as a page width printhead in a printing system includes a casing assembly for housing drive electronics. A printhead module is mounted in the casing. The printhead module includes a fluid channel member. Printhead tiles are carried by the fluid channel member, the printhead tiles having printhead integrated circuits incorporating printing nozzles.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly comprising: a casing assembly including an integral support frame and a cover portion, the integral support frame having an outer wall portion and an inner wall portion separated by an internal cavity, and a channel portion provided above the internal cavity; a fluid channel member provided in the channel portion; a plurality of printhead tiles carried on the fluid channel member, each printhead tile having a printhead integrated circuit incorporating printing nozzles; and a plurality of printed circuit board (PCB) support structures removable engaged with the inner wall portion, and extending end-to-end along a longitudinal length of the casing assembly, each PCB support structure adapted to receive thereon a PCB including thereon drive circuitry for driving a plurality of printhead tiles; where the cover portion is configured to engage said integral support frame to enclose the PCB. 2. A printhead assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the printhead tiles are carried on an operatively upper surface of the fluid channel member. 3. A printhead assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein each of the printhead tiles has a stepped end region, and the printhead integrated circuits of two adjacent printhead tiles overlap in this region overlap in the stepped end region. 4. A printhead assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein the printhead integrated circuits extend at an angle relative to a longitudinal direction of the printhead tiles to facilitate overlapping between the printhead integrated circuits.
