An induction hardening apparatus for inductively heating and quench hardening a crankshaft includes an arrangement of two workstations similarly configured and a robotic device indexing the crankshaft from a first workstation to a second workstation. The induction hardening apparatus is designed with a single induction coil located at the first workstation for the sequential induction heating and quench hardening of the pins of the crankshaft. At the second workstation, a single induction coil is used for the bearing surfaces of the crankshaft. One feature of the present invention is that the induction coils do not contact the surfaces of the crankshaft which are being inductively heated and quench hardened. Crankshaft dimensions and geometry are programmed into servodrive systems which move the corresponding coil in X and Y directions accurately tracing the orbit or path of each pin and each bearing surface. Another feature of the present invention is the use of an offset 180 degree coil which provides improved heating patterns in less time than traditional 90 degree coils.
