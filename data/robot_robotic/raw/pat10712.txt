An articulated industrial robot has an articulated horizontal arm assembly which includes horizontal arms (20), a vertically movable shaft (20) mounted on the extremity of the horizontal arm assembly, and a motor for driving the vertically movable shaft. When directly teaching motions to the vertically movable shaft through a direct teaching operation by an operator, the current control unit of a motor control unit for driving the motor for driving the vertically movable shaft is disconnected from a signal line connected to a robot control unit, and a torque calculating circuit is provided for deciding a motor torque corresponding to the sum of the weight of the vertically movable shaft and the respective variable weights of an end effector attached to the lower end of the vertically movable shaft. A workpiece held by the end effector is connected to the current control unit to compensate the load torque of the vertically movable shaft with the torque of the motor so that the operator is able to carry out the direct teaching operation while substantially no load is imposed on the operator.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of direct teaching by an operator of a motion command to a motor-driven vertically movable shaft, which is arranged at the extremity of a horizontal articulated arm assembly of a multi-articulated robot, and is operated by a programmed command issued from a robot control unit, comprising the steps of: storing values corresponding to a weight of said vertically movable shaft and a variable weight applied to a lower end of said vertically movable shaft; disconnecting a signal line extending from said robot control unit to an electric current control circuit of a motor control unit for controlling a motor for driving said vertically movable shaft when starting a teaching operation by said operator; connecting a signal line extending from a torque calculating circuit for deciding a load torque corresponding to a sum of the stored values of the weight of said vertically movable shaft and the variable weight applied to a lower end of said vertically movable shaft to said electric current control unit of said motor control unit for controlling a motor for driving said vertically movable shaft to thereby preliminarily compensate said load torque applied to said vertically movable shaft with a drive torque exerted by said motor; and, moving said vertically movable shaft up and down by a manual operation of said operator to thereby directly teach a desired motion to said shaft while substantially no load is imposed on said operator. 2. A multi-articulated industrial robot including a plurality of mutually articulated horizontal arms operated by a programmed command supplied from a robot control unit, a vertically movable shaft mounted for up and down motion on an extremity of said articulated horizontal arms and having an end effector at a lower end thereof, and a drive motor for the vertically movable shaft, comprising: means for deciding a load torque applied to said vertically movable shaft, said deciding means comprising a shaft weight storage means for storing a weight of said vertically movable shaft, a variable weight storage means for storing a variable weight loaded on said lower end of said vertically movable shaft, and a weight-torque converting means connected to said shaft weight storage means and said variable weight storage means; a first normally open switching means arranged between an electric current control means accommodated in a motor control unit connected to said robot control unit and controlling a motor for driving said vertically movable shaft, and said means for deciding a load torque applied to said vertically movable shaft; a second normally closed switching means arranged between a command transmitting line for transmitting position and velocity command signals from said robot control unit to said motor control unit controlling the motor for driving said vertically movable shaft and said electric current control means; and means for effecting a switching of said first switching means from an open position thereof to a closed position as well as a switching of said second switching means from a closed position thereof to an open position when an operator carries out a direct teaching of a motion command to said vertically movable shaft, whereby the load of said vertically movable shaft is compensated by a torque exerted by said motor to permit the operator to carry out said direct teaching under a substantially no load condition. 3. A multi-articulated industrial robot according to claim 2, wherein said variable weight storage means comprises: a first storage means for storing a weight of said end effector, and; a second storage means for storing a weight of a workpiece held by said end effector. 4. A multi-articulated industrial robot according to claim 2, wherein said means for deciding a load torque applied to said vertically movable shaft comprises a computing circuit means for effecting a calculation and conversion of a weight value into a torque value. 5. A multi-articulated industrial robot according to claim 2, wherein said electric current control means of said motor control unit for controlling said motor for driving said vertically movable shaft comprises an electric feed-back line for feeding back an electric drive current for said motor from an output circuit of said electric drive current into said electric current control means. 6. A multi-articulated industrial robot including a plurality of mutually articulated horizontal arms operated by a programmed command supplied from a robot control unit, a vertically movable shaft mounted for up and down motion on an extremity of said articulated horizontal arms and having an end effector at a lower end thereof, and a drive motor for the vertically movable shaft, comprising: a means for deciding a load torque applied to said vertically movable shaft, said deciding means comprising a shaft weight storage means for storing a weight of said vertically movable shaft, a variable weight storage means for storing a variable weight loaded on said lower end of said vertically movable shaft, and a weight-torque converting means connected to said shaft weight storage means and said variable weight storage means; a first normally open switching means arranged between an electric current control means accommodated in a motor control unit connected to said robot control unit and controlling a motor for driving said vertically movable shaft, and said means for deciding to load torque applied to said vertically movable shaft; a second normally closed switching means arranged between a command transmitting line for transmitting position and velocity command signals from said robot control unit to said motor control unit controlling the motor for driving said vertically movable shaft and said electric current control means; and means for effecting a switching of said first switching means from an open position thereof to a closed position as well as a switching of said second switching means from a closed position thereof to an open position when an operator carries out a direct teaching of a motion command to said vertically movable shaft, so that the load of said vertically movable shaft is compensated by a torque exerted by said motor to permit the operator to carry out said direct teaching under a substantially no load condition.
