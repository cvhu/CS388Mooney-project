Disclosed is an electronic substrate processing system comprising a processing equipment for processing electronic substrates including semiconductor wafers and liquid crystal substrates; a cleaning equipment for cleaning said electronic substrate in a predetermined processing step; a portable closed container for accommodating a cassette containing said electronic substrate; a purging station for gas-purging said portable closed containers; and a storage member for storing said portable closed containers, wherein said cassette accommodates said electronic substrates which have been cleaned by said cleaning equipment being set in said portable closed container and purged with an inert gas in said purging station, and said portable closed container or containers is stored in said storing section when necessary.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electronic substrate processing system comprising, in combination: at least one cassette for holding substrates to be processed; a cleaning station including a cassette carry-in opening for receiving said at least one cassette and a liquid cleaning and drying system for liquid cleaning and drying said at least one cassette; a purging station adjacent the cleaning station, said purging station including a cassette receiving area for receiving said at least one cassette following a cleaning and drying procedure; a closable portable container delivery system; means for assembling a closed portable container around said at least one cassette after the cassette is received at said receiving area so as to enclose the cassette; a means for opening an assembled portable container with the cassette therein to enable gas purging of the interior of the container; and means for closing the portable container with the cassette enclosed therein in sealed, purged condition; a storage device including a container receiving device for receiving a closed and sealed purged portable container with the cassette therein; a container storage section for storing said portable container; and a robotic handler for moving said portable container with the cassette therein from the container receiving device to the storage section; and a robotic transfer device for moving the sealed, purged portable closed container with the cassette therein from the purging station to the container receiving device of the storage device. 2. The apparatus recited in claim 1, including a processing station including a substrate film deposition device, said processing station including a closed, portable container interface device that includes a means for receiving a portable closed container including said at least one cassette; a robotic transfer device for transferring said closed, portable container enclosing said at least one cassette from said storage device to said portable container interface device; and a device in said processing station for removing said at least one cassette from said closed container. 3. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said liquid cleaning and drying system and said purging station are integrated into a single cleaning and purging station. 4. An electronic substrate processing system including a substrate cleaning system, said cleaning system including, in combination: at least one cassette for holding substrates to be processed; a housing enclosing the substrate cleaning system, said housing including a cassette carry-in device for receiving said at least one cassette in the housing; and a means for transporting the cassette away from the carry-in device and along the cleaning system; said cleaning system including cassette liquid cleaning and drying devices; a gas purging system in the housing, said purging system including a device for receiving a cleaned and dried cassette following a liquid cleaning and drying process carried out by the cleaning system; a closed portable container delivery system; and means for assembling a closed portable container around said at least one cassette so as to enclose the cassette; a gas purging apparatus for purging the interior of the portable container containing the said at least one cassette with an inert gas, and means for closing the portable container with the enclosed at least one cassette in sealed purged condition; said housing including a carry-out opening for enabling removal of the portable container containing the at least one cassette from the housing. 5. The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, said purging system comprising an enclosed purging chamber within said housing. 6. The apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein said purging chamber is defined at least in part by a partition wall in said housing, and an access door in the partition wall for admitting the passage of a cleaned and dried cassette; said cleaning device located on one side of the partition wall and said purging chamber located on the opposite side of said wall. 7. The apparatus as claimed in claim 6, said purging chamber including a cassette receiving stand arranged to cooperate with said means for assembling a closed portable container, whereby a cassette received on the stand may be enclosed by the portable container assembly means, the container can be opened, the container may then be gas purged, and the container may be closed by said means for closing the container. 8. The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, said cleaning system including a lifting robot associated with said purging station and said device for receiving a cleaned and dried cassette and for handling components of an assembled portable container that are assembled to enclose a cleaned and dried cassette. 9. The apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the drying device of said cleaning and drying device is associated with and located in the purging chamber.
