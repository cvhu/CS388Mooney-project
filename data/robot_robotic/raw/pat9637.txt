A first cladding region (12) having a first surface and a second surface is formed. The first surface (18) having a first core region extending on the first surface (18) and the second surface (19) having a second core region extending on the second surface (19). A second cladding region (13) having a third surface (17) with the third surface (17) affixed on the first surface (18) of the first cladding region (12). A third cladding region (11) having a fourth surface (21) with the fourth surface (21) of the third cladding region (11) affixed to the second surface (19) of the first cladding region (12).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An optical waveguide module comprising: an interconnect substrate having a first plurality of electrical traces and a first plurality of bonding pads; a waveguide with a first end, a second end, a first surface, a second surface, a core region, and a cladding region, the cladding region surrounds the core region and forms the first surface and the second surface, the first end exposes a first portion of the core region and a second portion of the cladding region with the second end exposes a third portion of the core region and a fourth portion of the cladding region; a forming body having a first surface, a second surface, and a curved surface, the first surface of the forming body mated to the second surface of the waveguide with curved surface located at the first end of the waveguide; a flexible tape having an optically clear portion, a second plurality of electrical traces, a second plurality of electrical bonding pads, and a third plurality of bonding pads, the optically clear portion of the flexible tape being operably coupled with the first portion of the core region of waveguide, the flexible tape being mated along the first end and the curved surface and along the second surface of the forming body and extending therefrom; and a photonic device having a working portion and a fourth surface, the working portion operably coupled to one of the first plurality of bonding pads of the flexible tape and the core region of the waveguide; and a heat dissipating device attached to the fourth surface of the photonic device, thereby making optical waveguide module. 2. An optical waveguide module as claimed in claim 1 further including a plastic portion, wherein the plastic portion encapsulates at least a portion of the waveguide.
