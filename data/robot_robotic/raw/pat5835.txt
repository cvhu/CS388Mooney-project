A method for concurrent data migration includes classifying files to be migrated into plural jobs, selecting media to which to migrate each job, and using plural drives concurrently to write the jobs to the media. The selection of a medium is performed in a way that prevents the number of writeable media from exceeding the number of available drives, unless no allocated medium has sufficient space to store any files in a migration job. A medium is preferentially selected that has already been allocated for writing, has space to store at least one file in the job, is not in use for another job, and can be robotically mounted on a drive. If such a medium does not exist, then the set of available media is canvassed to locate an alternative medium. The attributes of each medium are evaluated to determine which medium can be selected most consistently with the goals of (1) preventing the number of media from exceeding the number of drives, and (2) providing sufficient media to allow plural drives to be used concurrently. The technique can be embodied in a file management environment that transparently migrates files meeting certain criteria and stores the location of the migrated file in a reparse point provided by the file system.

A method of using a plurality of media for a data migration system, each of said media being designatable as being in a writeable state or a non-writeable state, said method comprising: receiving a request to migrate a quantity of data; identifying from among said plurality of media, a set of media that are in the writeable state and that have sufficient space to store said quantity of data; determining that each of the media in said set is in use for the reading or writing of data; determining that the number of said plurality of media in the writeable state is greater than or equal to a first number; waiting for a medium from said set to become available; and writing said data to the available medium, wherein said data migration system includes a device having one or more drives which read and write said plurality of media, a library for the storage of media, and a robotic mechanism which mounts media stored in said library on said drives, said method further comprising: determining that none of the media located in said library is in the writeable state. 5. A method of using a plurality of double-sided media for a data migration system, each side of said media being designatable as being in a writeable state or a non-writeable state, said method comprising: receiving a request to migrate a quantity of data; identifying, from among said plurality of media, a first set of media having a side in the writeable state and whose side in the writeable state has sufficient space to store said quantity of data; determining that each of said media in said first set is in use for the reading or writing of data; identifying a first one of said plurality of media which is not in use for the reading or writing of data, and which has a first side that is in the non-writeable state and a second side whose state is not designated; designating said second side of said first medium as being in the writeable state; and writing said data to said second side of said first medium, wherein said data migration system includes a device having one or more drives which read and write said plurality of media, a library for the storage of media, and a robotic mechanism which mounts media stored in said library on said drives, said method further comprising; identifying, from among said plurality of media, a second set of media having a side in the writeable state and whose side in the writeable state has sufficient space to store said quantity of data, said second set being different from said first set; and determining that each of said media in said second set is not located in said device. 6.
