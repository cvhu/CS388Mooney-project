A surgical robotic system includes a robotic arm, an end effector movably connected thereto and provided with a movable end effector element driven by an actuator, and a force sensor arranged between the robotic arm and the end effector. The actuator is formed by a hydraulic cylinder. The robotic arm is provided with a hydraulic line connected to said hydraulic cylinder of the end effector.
Claims I claim: 1. A surgical robotic system comprising: a robotic arm, an end effector movably connected to the robotic arm and provided with at least one movable end effector element driven by an actuator, and a force sensor arranged between the robotic arm and the end effector, wherein said actuator is formed by a hydraulic cylinder, and said robotic arm is provided with a hydraulic line connected to said hydraulic cylinder, wherein the cross-sectional area of the hydraulic cylinder is at least ten times the cross-sectional area of the hydraulic line. 2. The surgical robotic system according to claim 1, wherein the hydraulic cylinder is formed by a closed bellows. 3. The surgical robotic system according to claim 1, wherein the hydraulic line is operated by a hydraulic fluid, and wherein the hydraulic fluid is a saline solution. 4. The surgical robotic system according to claim 1, wherein the force sensor is formed as a force/moment sensor. 5. The surgical robotic system according to claim 1, wherein the hydraulic cylinder is arranged to symmetrically drive two of said movable end effector elements forming a gripping means. 6. The surgical robotic system according to claim 1, wherein the coupling of the hydraulic cylinder to the end effector element is formed in such a manner that an expansion of the hydraulic cylinder is to cause a closing movement of the end effector element.
