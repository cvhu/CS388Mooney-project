A multifunctional end effector includes a quick release finger locking mechanism disposed in each of the pair of fingers which maintains system accuracy and integrity by providing a positive pressure force between the end effector finger and the mating locking plates provided on the tools adapted to cooperate with the end effector. In one embodiment the mating locking plate intrudes into the fingers of the end effector and an alternative embodiment the end effector finger engaging mechanisms grasp and lock on ledges provided on the cooperating mating locking plates.
Claims Having thus set forth the nature of the invention, what is claimed is: 1.

A quick release finger locking mechanism for an end effector disposed on the distal end of a robotic arm, according to claim 1 wherein said elongated yoke member is generally in the form of the letter "H" in a plan view, said third and fourth pivotal axis being disposed between the arms thereof and said shaft means being centrally affixed to the transverse portion thereof. 3. A quick release finger locking mechanism for an end effector disposed on the distal end of a robotic arm, according to claim 1 wherein said drive means is affixed to said base plate. 4. A quick release finger locking mechanism for an end effector disposed on the distal end of a robotic arm, according to claim 1 wherein said drive means is pneumatically activated. 5. A quick release finger locking mechanism for an end effector disposed on the distal end of a robotic arm, according to claim 1 wherein said drive means is electrically activated. 6. A quick release finger locking mechanism suitable for an end effector disposed on the distal end of a robotic arm wherein said end effector has a pair of extending fingers, the improvement which comprises: a) a base plate affixed in each of said fingers, said base plate having; i) a relatively large elongated through aperture, said through aperture being provided with a first pivotal axis disposed proximate one end thereof and a second pivotable axis disposed proximate the other end thereof; b) an elongated yoke member affixed on one end of a shaft means adapted to be slidably received in said relatively large elongated through aperture, said yoke member being provided with; i) a pair of elongated openings, one of said openings being disposed on each end thereof, ii) a third and a fourth pivotal axis generally centrally disposed within each of said elongated openings; c) a pair of elongated translating means; i) said first translating means being provided with, a first transverse through aperture disposed proximate one end thereof adapted to slidably receive said first pivotable axis, a second transverse elongated through aperture generally centrally disposed adapted to slidably receive said third pivotable axis therein and a first capturing notch disposed on the distal portion of the other end thereof; ii) said second translating means being provided with, a first transverse through aperture disposed proximate one end thereof adapted to slidably receive said second pivotable axis, a second transverse elongated through aperture generally centrally disposed adapted to slidably receive said fourth pivotable axis therein and a second capturing notch disposed on the distal portion of the other end thereof; and d) drive means disposed in each of said fingers coupled to a source of energy and connected to said shaft means, said drive means being adapted to move said shaft means to a compressed or locking position and to move said shaft means to an extended or releasing position, said energy source being remotely controlled; wherein when said drive means moves said shaft means to said second position, said translating means moves to permit said capturing notches to engage a cooperating means provided on an end effector replaceable tool, locking it into position. 7. A quick release finger locking mechanism for an end effector having a pair of extending fingers and disposed on the distal end of a robotic arm, comprising: a) a base plate affixed in each of said fingers, said base plate having; i) a relatively large elongated through aperture, said through aperture being provided with a first pivotal axis disposed proximate one end thereof and a second pivotable axis disposed proximate the other end thereof; b) an elongated yoke member affixed on one end of a shaft means adapted to be slidably received in said relatively large elongated through aperture, said yoke member being provided with; i) a pair of elongated openings, one of said openings being disposed on each end thereof, ii) a third and a fourth pivotal axis generally centrally disposed within each of said elongated openings; c) a pair of elongated translating means; i) said first translating means being provided with, a first transverse through aperture disposed proximate one end thereof adapted to slidably receive said first pivotable axis, a second transverse elongated through aperture generally centrally disposed adapted to slidably receive said third pivotable axis therein and a first capturing notch disposed on the distal portion of the other end thereof; and ii) said second translating means being provided with, a first transverse through aperture disposed proximate one end thereof adapted to slidably receive said second pivotable axis, a second transverse elongated through aperture generally centrally disposed adapted to slidably receive said fourth pivotable axis therein and a second capturing notch disposed on the distal portion of the other end thereof; and d) drive means disposed in each of said fingers coupled to a source of energy and connected to said shaft means, said drive means being adapted to move said shaft means to a first or locking position and to move said shaft means to a second or releasing position, said energy source being remotely controlled; wherein when said drive means moves said shaft means to said first position, said translating means moves to permit said capturing notches to lock a cooperating means provided on an end effector replaceable tool, locking it into position and providing a force directed towards said end effector fingers.
