A system which utilizes a source of ultraviolet radiation to mark a surface or to cure selectively a photosensitive paint applied to a surface. The source of UV light is either a laser or a broadband source and the light is controlled by an aperture and/or a stencil apparatus. The photosensitive paint is applied by a controlled technique as a protective or a decorative coating.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of painting a surface of an article, having a changing contour over portions thereof, comprising: coating at least a portion of the surface of the article with a paint which is curable upon being irradiated with light having a given wavelength; irradiating only a portion of the coated surface of the article, in a desired pattern, with a laser beam having a wavelength in said given range to cure the paint contained in the irradiated pattern and leaving the paint outside the irradiated pattern in an uncured state; said irradiating being performed while effecting transverse relative motion between the laser beam and the coated surface and shaping a cross-section of the laser beam into a desired pattern by passing the laser beam through optical shaping means before impingement on the coated surface, said optical shaping means being variable during the irradiating to modify the desired pattern, said optical shaping means also maintaining transverse dimensions of the laser beam received at the coated surface greater than both the paint thickness and the article's thermal diffusion distance; and, removing the uncured paint from the surface of the article. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein said shaping step includes passing the beam through an opening in an opaque member, the opening having the shape of the desired pattern. 3. A method according to claim 2, wherein the opaque member comprises a stencil in the form of a rotatable disc having a plurality of openings each forming a different pattern, the disc being positioned so that the openings can be selectively placed in the path of the beam by rotating the disc, and said shaping step includes rotating the disc to position a selected opening in the path of the laser beam. 4. A method for painting a predetermined design of a first dimension onto a surface comprising the steps of: applying a coating of ultraviolet light radiation curing paint to the surface, said applied coating being of a second dimension which is larger than and overlays the predetermined design; applying a light in a broadband ultraviolet range through a stencil to produce a predetermined pattern consistent with the predetermined design onto the applied coating of paint in order to cure the paint in the predetermined design while leaving uncured paint on the surface, with the applying of the light including focusing the predetermined pattern of light onto the applied coating of paint by a zoom lens means whereby the size of the predetermined pattern of light can be changed by changing the zoom lens means effective focal length; and removing the balance of uncured paint, including over-spray through the application of a solvent selected to be neutral with respect to the cured paint surface, whereby the predetermined design is now represented by cured paint. 5. A method of paint detailing a surface of an automobile, comprising the steps of: applying a coating of ultraviolet light radiation curing paint onto said surface by means of a computer controlled paint applicator means having a close packed array of spray nozzle means which are selectively activated or deactivated to spray paint therefrom onto the surface, said applied coating being of a dimension corresponding to a final desired predetermined design; during said applying, moving said surface in a direction that is transverse relative to the spray paint being applied from said nozzle means, said array of spray nozzle means including individual nozzle means having a center to center spacing perpendicular to the direction of relative movement of the surface that is substantially smaller than a diameter of the individual nozzle means; and, applying a light in an ultraviolet range to the coating in order to cure the applied coating of paint. 6. The method according to claim 5 wherein the paint detailing of the surface of an automobile further includes the steps of applying at least a second coating of ultraviolet light radiation curing paint of a color different from the initially applied paint onto the surface, said second coating being of a dimension corresponding to a final desired predetermined design; and applying the light in an ultraviolet range to the coating in order to cure the second applied coating of paint.
