A control software system for generating and distributing motion media for operating a target motion device. The control software system generates the motion media based on a motion program generated at a content server. The control software system distributes the motion media to a client browser associated with the target motion device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of communicating motion data through a distributed network, the method comprising the steps of: providing a content server, where the content server stores a plurality of hardware independent motion programs; providing a control software system for generating hardware dependent motion media based on hardware independent motion programs; providing a client browser for operating a target device based on hardware dependent motion media; connecting the control software system, the content server, and the client browser to the distributed network; using the client browser to identify over the distributed network a selected hardware independent motion program from the plurality of hardware independent motion programs stored by the content server; transferring the selected motion program from the content server to the control software system over the distributed network; generating selected hardware dependent motion media at the control software system based on the selected hardware independent motion program; and transmitting the selected hardware dependent motion media over the distributed network to operate the target device associated with the client browser based on the selected hardware dependent motion media. 2. A method as recited in claim 1, further comprising the steps of: creating non-motion data at the content server; combining the non-motion data with selected hardware dependent motion media at the control software system to obtain enhanced selected hardware dependent motion media; and transmitting the enhanced selected hardware dependent motion media to the client browser. 3. A method as recited in claim 1, further comprising the steps of: storing ratings rules associated with the client browser; and modifying the hardware dependent motion media based on which the target device operates based on the ratings rules.
