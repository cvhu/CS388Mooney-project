Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 41, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 77, 79, 86 or 87 which inhibits the expression of Interferon gamma receptor 1. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 2 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 6 wherein the modifiec nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of Interferon gamma receptor 1 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of Interferon gamma receptor 1 is inhibited. 11. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
