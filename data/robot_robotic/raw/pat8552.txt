The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleotides 57 to 89 of a region which overlaps at least one nucleotide of a start codon, nucleotides 72 to 1315 of a coding region, or nucleotides 4 to 55 of a 5'-untranslated region of human Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2 (SEQ ID NO: 1), wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 31, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 14, 15, 19, 21, 26, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 44 or 46. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 31, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 or 45. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-2 is inhibited.
