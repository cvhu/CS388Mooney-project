A quick disconnect tooling apparatus for releasably latching an end effector tool to a manipulator. The present invention provides a base module connectable to a manipulator, and a tool module connectable to the end effector tool. A power source coupling has a first portion coupled to the base module, and a second portion coupled to the tool module, wherein the first and second portions of the power source coupling may cooperatively engage one another to allow for the passing of power between the manipulator and the end effector tool. A releasable latch is connected to the base module and is moveable between a latched position, wherein the latch cooperatively engages a latch pin connected to the tool module to secure the tool module to the base module and allow the first and second portions of the power source coupling to communicate with one another, and an unlatched position, wherein the releasable latch does not engage the latch pin thereby allowing the base module and the tool module to be disconnected and the first and second portions of the power source coupling to be disconnected.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A manually actuated quick disconnect tooling apparatus for releasably latching an end effector tool to a manipulator, comprising: a base module having at least one first slot and at least one second slot, the base module connectable to the manipulator; a tool module having a hinge pin extending across one side of said tool module and operative to be received by said first slot and a latch pin extending across the opposite side of said tool module and operative to be received by said second slot, the tool module connectable to the end effector tool; at least one power source coupling having a first portion coupled to said base module and a second portion coupled to said tool module wherein said first and second portions cooperatively engage one another to allow for the passing of power between the manipulator and the end effector tool; and a releasable latch connected to said base module and manually moveable between a latched position, wherein said latch cooperatively engages said latch pin to secure said latch pin in said second slot, so as to secure said tool module to said base module and allow said first and second portions of said power source coupling to communicate, and an unlatched position, wherein said latch does not engage said latch pin thereby allowing said base module and said tool module to be disconnected and said first and second portions of said power source coupling to be disconnected. 2. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 1, wherein said at least one power source coupling further comprises: at least one air valve mounted in one of said base module and said tool module, and said at least one air valve moving between an open position, wherein the other of said base module and said tool module engages said at least one air valve to allow pressurized air or vacuum to flow through said base module and said tool module, and a closed position, wherein said other of said base module and said tool module does not engage said at least one air valve thereby allowing said at least one air valve to bias toward a closed position to prevent said pressurized air or vacuum from passing through said base module and said tool module. 3. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 1, wherein said at least one power source coupling further comprises: at least one electrical connector having a female connector in one of said base module and said tool module, and a male connector in said other of said base module and said tool module, wherein said male and female connectors engage one another in said latched position to allow electrical power to flow between said base module and said tool module. 4. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 1, further comprising: an alignment device having a pin connected to and extending from one of said base module and said tool module, and a recess formed on the other of said base module and said tool module for receiving said pin to ensure a single assembled configuration of said base module to said tool module. 5. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 1, wherein said releasable latch further comprises: a release handle pivotally connected to said base module and having a cam surface for engaging said latch pin in the latched position; and a torsional spring coupled to said release handle for biasing said release handle toward said latched position. 6. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 1, wherein: said first and second slots are different sizes; said hinge pin has a different diameter than said latch pin; and said first slot is sized to receive said hinge pin and said second slot is sized to receive said latch pin. 7. A manually actuated quick disconnect tooling apparatus for releasably latching an end effector tool to a manipulator, comprising: a base module connectable to the manipulator, and said base module having a mounting block and at least one first slot and at least one second slot; a tool module connectable to the end effector tool, and said tool module having a mounting block and a hinge pin extending across one side of said tool module and operative to be received by said first slot and a latch pin extending across the opposite side of said tool module and operative to be received by said second slot; at least one power source coupling having a first portion housed within said mounting block of said base module and a second portion housed within said mounting block of said tool module wherein said first and second portions of said power source coupling may cooperatively engage one another to allow for the passing of power between the manipulator and the end effector; and a releasable latch pivotally connected to said base module, and said releasable latch manually pivotal between a latched position, wherein said latch cooperatively engages said latch pin to secure said latch pin in said second slot, so as to secure said tool module to said base module and allow said first and second portions of said power source coupling to communicate with one another, and an unlatched position, wherein said latch does not engage said latch pin, thereby allowing said base module and said tool module to be disconnected and allowing said first and second portions of said power source coupling to be disconnected. 8. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 7 wherein said at least one power source coupling further comprises: at least one air valve housed within said mounting block of said base module, and said air valve moving between an open position, wherein said mounting block of said tool module engages said air valve to allow pressurized air or vacuum to flow through said base module and said tool module, and a closed position, wherein said mounting block of said tool module does not engage said air valve, thereby allowing said air valve to prevent pressurized air or vacuum from passing through said base module to said tool module. 9. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 7, wherein said at least one power source coupling, further comprises: at least one electrical connector having a female connector in one of said mounting block of said base module and said tool module, and a male connector in said other of said mounting block of said base module and said tool module, wherein said male and female connectors engage one another in said latched position to allow electrical power to flow between said base module and said tool module. 10. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 7, further comprising: an alignment device having a pin connected to and extending from one of said base module and said tool module in a non-symmetrical location relative to said one of said base module and said tool module, and a recess formed on the other of said base module and said tool module for receiving said pin to provide proper alignment of said base module to said tool module. 11. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 7, wherein said releasable latch further comprises: a release handle pivotally connected to said base module and having a cam surface for engaging said latch pin in said latched position; and a torsional spring coupled to said release handle for biasing said release handle toward said latched position. 12. The quick disconnect tooling apparatus stated in claim 7, wherein: said first slot is substantially vertical oriented; and said second slot is substantially horizontal oriented and wherein said vertical and horizontal slots, as well as said latch pin and said hinge pin, are different sizes to ensure a predetermined orientation of said base module and said tool module.
