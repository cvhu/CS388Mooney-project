A pipetting apparatus has a fluidic space to which a pressure transducer with a pressure sensor is attached with a gas filled space. The fluidic space is defined by a pipette tip, a first tubing that connects the pipette tip to a pump, and an active part of the pump. The pipetting apparatus further has an impulse generating mechanism that is in operative contact with a column of system liquid inside the fluidic space. The impulse generating mechanism induces a vertical movement in the system liquid column, which results in a pressure variation in the gas filled space that is pneumatically connected with the fluidic space. This pressure variation, as recorded with the pressure transducer and as processed by a first data processing unit during utilization of this pipetting apparatus, is taken as an indicator for the detection of penetration or of quitting of a surface of a liquid, with an orifice of the pipette tip, of which liquid an amount is to be aspirated and dispensed. This pressure variation is also taken as an indicator for the detection of the presence or the absence of gas bubbles in the system liquid contained in the fluidic space of this pipetting apparatus.
