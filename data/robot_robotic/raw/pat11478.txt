A robot or other manipulator has an end effector useful for gripping a part and performing an assembly operation to a second part, the assembly requiring, for example, an insertion and a rotation motion. A sensor is mounted between the manipulator and the end effector and comprises a pair of telescoping sections mounted for relative axial and rotational movement with springs for normally inhibiting any movement beyond a range caused by normal assembly forces. An excessive force caused by the failure of the parts to join normally results in a relative axial or rotational movement which is sensed by one or more cam operated switches. The switches are arranged to yield a plurality of signals which contain coded information on the specific type of overload movement. The information can be used by a robot or manipulator controller to stop the assembly operation and then to make the appropriate movements to solve the problem or to simply indicate to an operator the type of malfunction. The sensor utility is not limited to assembly applications, but can detect excessive force or movement in other automatic operations.
Claims The embodments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A sensor for monitoring operations performed by a manipulator which drives an end effector through at least two degrees of freedom, the sensor comprising: input and output sections between and mounted to the manipulator and the end effector respectively for transmitting forces to the end effector, the output section having a generally cylindrical portion, the input section having a bore for receiving the cylindrical portion for axial and rotational motion in the bore, first spring means acting between the input and output sections for maintaining the output section in a normal axial position unless overcome by a predetermined axial load, second spring means acting between the input and output sections for maintaining the output section in a normal rotary position unless overcome by a predetermined torque, first, second, and third switches mounted on the input section, and cam means carried by the output section for movement therewith and operatively connected to the switches including a first cam for operating the first switch whenever the output section moves from a normal position in either the axial or rotary sense to yield an indication of an abnormal position, a second cam for operating the second switch when the output section moves from the normal position in the rotary sense to yield information on the mode of any abnormal position, and a third cam for operating the third switch when the output section rotates in a given direction from the normal rotary position to yield information on the direction of any abnormal rotation. 2. A sensor for monitoring operations performed by a manipulator which drives an end effector through at least two degrees of freedom, the sensor comprising; input and output sections between and mounted to the manipulator and the end effector respectively for transmitting forces to the end effector and for allowing axial and rotational motion, spring means acting between the input and output sections for maintaining the output section in a normal axial position unless overcome by a predetermined axial load, and in a normal rotary position unless overcome by a predetermined torque, first, second, and third switches mounted on one of the sections, and cam means carried by the other of the sections for movement therewith and operatively connected to the switches including a first cam for operating the first switch whenever the output section moves from a normal position in either axial or rotary sense to yield an indication of an abnormal position, a second cam for operating the second switch when the output section moves from the normal position in the rotary sense to yield information on the mode of any abnormal position, and a third cam for operating the third switch when the output section rotates in a given direction from the normal rotary position to yield information on the direction of any abnormal rotation.
