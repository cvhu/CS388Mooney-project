A hybrid robotic joint actuator utilizing both the quick response time of an electric motor and the high torque capacity of a pneumatic motor. In one preferred embodiment, the hybrid motor includes a pneumatic rotor coupled to an electric rotor in a common stator housing.
Claims I claim: 1. A hybrid drive comprising; a. a housing; b. a first rotor within said housing, said first rotor comprising a pneumatic rotor, said housing including a pneumatic stator, said pneumatic rotor and pneumatic stator comprising a pneumatic motor; c. a second rotor coupled to said first rotor, such that the first and second rotors share the load of said hybrid motor, said second rotor comprising an electric rotor, and said hybrid motor further including an electric stator which engages said electric rotor, said second rotor and electric stator comprising an electric motor; d. a controller which continuously adjusts the torque applied by the pneumatic motor so that the electric motor's load is decreased so as to prevent overheating the electric motor, and said controller further adjusts the torque of the electric motor to compensate for torque deficiencies of the pneumatic motor. 2. The hybrid motor of claim 1 wherein said electric motor and said pneumatic motor occupy a common housing. 3. The hybrid motor of claim 1 wherein said pneumatic stator is integral with said housing. 4. The hybrid motor of claim 1 wherein said pneumatic motor is a pneumatic vane motor. 5. The hybrid motor of claim 1 wherein said electric motor is a direct drive motor.
