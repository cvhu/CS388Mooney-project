High throughput screening of crystallization of a target material is accomplished by simultaneously introducing a solution of the target material into a plurality of chambers of a microfabricated fluidic device. The microfabricated fluidic device is then manipulated to vary the solution condition in the chambers, thereby simultaneously providing a large number of crystallization environments. Control over changed solution conditions may result from a variety of techniques, including but not limited to metering volumes of crystallizing agent into the chamber by volume exclusion, by entrapment of volumes of crystallizing agent determined by the dimensions of the microfabricated structure, or by cross-channel injection of sample and crystallizing agent into an array of junctions defined by intersecting orthogonal flow channels.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A device for positioning protein crystal within an energy beam comprising: a chip for holding said crystal therein, said chip being made from an elastomeric block having disposed therein a deflectable membrane; an adapter plate for connecting said chip to a post, said chip being connected to said adapter plate through one or more posts penetrating into said chip; and, a goniometer, wherein said goniometer is connected to said adapter plate for positioning said crystal within said beam. 2. The device of claim 1 wherein said adapter plate is movably translatable so as to further position said crystal within an axis perpendicular to said beam. 3. The device of claim 1 wherein said goniometer is rotatable about an axis perpendicular and intersecting said beam, and said chip is rotated about said axis of said beam so as to expose different facets of said crystal to said beam.
