A purge concentrate for purging paint spraying and other coating equipment has about 20%-60% by weight water; about 10%-40% by weight of an active solvent; about 10%-50% by weight of a co-solvent; about 1-9% by weight of a penetrant; and about 0.2-2.0% by weight wetting agent. It need not be heated to the curing temperature of heat curing paints and thus purges these paints more effectively.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A purge concentrate for purging coating equipment comprising: about 20%-60% by weight water; about 10%-40% by weight of an active solvent; about 10%-50% by weight of a co-solvent; about 1%-9% by weight of a penetrant; about 0.2%-2.0% by weight wetting agent; and about 0.5%-1.5% by weight EDTA; the solvent being a dibasic ester mixture and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, the co-solvent being an ether and the wetting agent being a non-ionic surfactant, the purge concentrate being adapted for purging coatings which are resistant to water-based solvents. 2. A purge concentrate according to claim 1 wherein the penetrant is a soap. 3. A purge concentrate according to claim 1 wherein the penetrant comprises an amine compound and the concentrate has a pH in the range of about 8 to about 9.5. 4. A purge concentrate according to claim 3 wherein the amine compound is selected from the group consisting of monoethylene amine, triethanol amine, heterocyclic amide and amine derivatives of N. Methyl pyrrolidine. 5. A purge concentrate according to claim 1 wherein the wetting agent is a surfactant selected to have high foaming characteristic and high critical micelle temperature which enhances purging at a temperature range of 150 to 190.degree. F. 6. A purge concentrate according to claim 1 wherein the wetting agent is a surfactant chosen to have low foam and low critical micelle temperature which improves purging at temperatures up to 100.degree. F. to avoid curing of heat curable coatings to be purged.
