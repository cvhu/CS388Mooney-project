The present invention provides for systems and methods that utilize automated and integratable workstations for identifying chemicals having useful activity. The present invention is also directed to chemical entities and information (e.g., chemical or biological activities of chemicals) generated or discovered by operation of workstations of the present invention. The present invention includes automated workstations that are programmably controlled to minimize processing times at each workstation and that can be integrated to minimize the processing time of the liquid samples from the start to finish of the process.
Claims We claim: 1. A computer program product, comprising a computer useable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon for enabling a computer processor in a system to assist in performing a liquid sample process having a predetermined set of liquid sample process properties, said system comprising a storage and retrieval module to store and retrieve, in accordance with store and retrieve instructions, a plurality of addressable wells; a sample transporter to transport, in accordance with transport instructions, a plurality of addressable wells, and a reaction module to react chemicals or to detect a physical property, in accordance with reaction or detection instructions, in a plurality of addressable wells, wherein said computer program logic comprises: a) a workflow model means for enabling said computer processor to define said process properties of integrated components of said system to enhance distribution of workflow in said system, and b) a processing instruction means for enabling said computer processor to generate processing instructions for routing workflow comprising: 1) store and retrieve instructions, 2) transport instructions, and 3) reaction and detection instructions that, when executed, enable said system to rapidly process addressable wells.
