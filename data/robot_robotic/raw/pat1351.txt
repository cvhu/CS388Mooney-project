An apparatus for transporting a storage media cartridge in a data storage library is disclosed. The apparatus includes an accessor, a pinion and a rack having a straight section and a curved section. The curved section includes multiple rack teeth that are capable of rotating independently from each other to allow the pinion to travel along the straight section and onto the curved section of the rack, or vice versa, without any interruption.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for transporting a storage media cartridge within a storage media library, said method comprising: utilizing an accessor for carrying said storage media cartridge; providing a rack having a straight section and a curved section within said storage media library, wherein said curved section includes a plurality of rack teeth that are capable of rotating independently from each other; and driving said accessor via a pinion, wherein said pinion is capable of traveling along said straight section and said curved section of said rack. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein one of said plurality of rack teeth includes a head and a cylindrical shaft. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said curved rack includes a plurality of cylindrical holes for receiving said plurality of rack teeth. 4. The method claim 1, wherein said pinion causes each of said plurality of rack teeth in said curved section to rotate slightly to conform with said pinion.
