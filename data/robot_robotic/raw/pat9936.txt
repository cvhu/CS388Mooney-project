A deduction inference system is connected to a plurality of sensor elements, a display device, and an actuator mechanism. The deduction inference system processes stimulus sensor signals received from responding sensor elements. Each sensor signal uniquely identifies condition/status information representative of the particular sensor element transmitting that signal. Using preestablished knowledge rules previously programmed into its memory, the deduction inference system is capable of executing and solving a "non NP-complete" deduction inference on the inputted stimulus sensor signals. The resulting data can then be presented onto a display device as a user friendly "smart" informational message or transmitted to an actuator mechanism attached thereto to control electro-mechanical devices and provide a real-time response to changing condition/status information transmitted form the plurality of sensor elements.
