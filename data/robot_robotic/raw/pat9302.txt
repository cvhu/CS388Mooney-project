A process and apparatus for forming a leak proof body and cap. The process including the steps of defining a mold cavity between a first mold part and a second mold part, injecting a molten material into the mold cavity thereby forming from the molten material a body and cap, and retracting the first mold part from the second mold part to separate the first mold part from the body and cap. Thereafter, engaging at least the body with a robotic arm and moving the body with the robotic arm into a capping device while the body and cap are at a temperature at which the material is not fully set. The body is then sealed by moving the cap into engagement with the body to form a leak proof seal.
Claims We claim: 1. A process for forming a leak-proof body and cap comprising the steps of: defining a mold cavity between a first mold part and a second mold part; injecting a molten plastic material into at least one mold cavity in the second mold part thereby forming from the molten material a body and cap; retracting the first mold part from the second mold part to separate the first mold part from the body and cap; engaging at least one of the body and cap before the material is fully set with engagement means on a robotic arm; removing the body and cap from the mold; moving the body and cap with the robotic arm into a capping device while the body and cap are at a temperature at which the material is not fully set; and sealing the body in the capping device before the material is fully set by moving the cap into engagement with the body to form a leak-proof seal before the material is fully set. 2. The process claim 1, wherein the engaging step comprises: inserting a receiving means between the first mold part and the body with the robotic arm; ejecting the body partially from the mold until the body and cap engage the receiving means; removing the body completely from the second mold part with the robotic arm. 3. The process of claim 2, wherein the ejecting step comprises activating a poppet in the mold. 4. The process of claim 2, wherein the receiving means inserted between the first mold part and the body is a plate having at least one suction cup thereon. 5. The process of claim 4, wherein the ejecting step comprises activating a suction source connected to the at least one suction cup. 6. The process of claim 1, further comprising a step, prior to the retracting step, of cooling the vial to a temperature at which the material will maintain its shape but is not fully set. 7. The process of claim 1, wherein the sealing step comprises pivoting a pivoting part to move the cap with respect to the body so as to guide the cap into engagement with the body to form a leak proof seal. 8. The process of claim 7, further comprising the steps of: providing a signal which indicates when the pivoting part has sealed the cap on the body; and dropping the sealed body from the capping device in response to the signal. 9. The process of claim 1, wherein the temperature of the vial during the grasping, moving and sealing steps is about 100.degree.-120.degree. F. 10. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step or applying suction through the engagement means to engage said one of the body and cap. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein the engagement means is softer than the material. 12. The process of claim 1, wherein the step of engaging is performed without damaging sealing surfaces on the body and cap. 13. The process of claim 1, wherein the body and cap are formed with a connecting hinge. 14. The process of claim 1, wherein both the body and the cap are engaged by the engaging means. 15. A process for forming an aseptic, leak-proof vial with a cap comprising the steps of: defining a mold cavity between an end mold part and an interior mold part on one side and a second mold part on the other side, wherein said interior mold part and said second mold part are in direct contact with each other; injecting a molten material into the mold cavity thereby forming from the molten material a vial and a cap, said vial having an annular region at the top edge thereof for interlocking with an annular region at the interior periphery of the cap; retracting the end mold part from the interior mold part to separate the end mold part from the vial and cap while applying a biasing force against the interior mold part so as to bias the interior mold part against the rest of the mold to retain the vial and cap within the second mold part; limiting the distance that the end mold part is separated from the interior mold part; retracting the interior mold part from the second mold part when the end mold part has been retracted a predetermined distance from the interior mold part; ejecting the vial and the cap at least partially from the mold before the material is fully set; engaging at least one of the vial and cap with engagement means on a robotic arm; moving the vial with the robotic arm into a vial holder having a pivoting part while the vial is at a temperature at which the interior of the vial is in an aseptic condition and the material has not fully set; pivoting the pivoting part to move the cap with respect to the vial so as to guide the interlocking annular region of the cap onto the corresponding interlocking annular region of the vial so as to seal the cap on the vial before the material is fully set and while the interior of the vial is in an aseptic condition. 16. The process of claim 15, further comprising the steps of: providing a signal which indicates when the pivoting part has sealed the cap on the vial; and dropping the sealed vial from the vial holder in response to the signal. 17. The process of claim 15, further including a step of venting from the mold cavity gases that are released during the injecting step. 18. The process of claim 15, further comprising a step of cooling the vial and cap to about 100.degree.-120.degree. F. before retracting the end mold part. 19. The process of claim 15, wherein the temperature of the vial during the grasping, moving and sealing steps is cool enough so that the material is not deformed and is hot enough so that the material is not fully set. 20. The process of claim 19, wherein the temperature of the vial during the grasping, moving and sealing steps is about 100.degree.-120.degree. F. 21. A process for forming a leak-proof body and cap comprising the steps of: defining a mold cavity between a first mold part and a second mold part; injecting a molten plastic material into at least one mold cavity in the second mold part thereby forming from the molten material a body and cap; inserting a receiving means between the first mold part and the body with a robotic arm; ejecting the body partially from the mold before the body and cap are fully set until the body and cap engage the receiving means; removing the body completely from the second mold part with the robotic arm; moving the body and cap with the robotic arm into a capping device while the body and cap are at a temperature at which the material is not fully set; and sealing the body before the material is fully set by moving the cap into engagement with the body to form a leak-proof seal. 22.
