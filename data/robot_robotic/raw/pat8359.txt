A method and an industrial robotic device for uniformly applying coatings at appropriate thickness and pitch upon a surface moves a spray applicator foam dispenser between two parallel tracks. The uniform application of foam at each pass is assured, by accelerating the speed of the foam dispenser at the end of each pass, by providing respective curved uphill distal ends of the tracks, so that the spray applicator foam dispenser moves up the curved distal ends and returns quickly while changing speed tilt and direction at the end of each pass.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of applying a spray-applied foam substance coating upon a structural surface, comprising the steps of continuously applying said foam substance in liquid form in adjacent axially extending bands of said foam substance to form a coating of a resultant solid layer of said substance, upon said structural surface, from a spray applicator source moving in alternate directions along a track having a straight, horizontal portion and respective arcuate uphill opposite end portions, said spray applicator source moving transverse to an axially extending direction of each band of said bands of said substance, each said band having a predetermined width and axially extending length, said spray applicator source moving laterally in a horizontal plane parallel to said structural surface, said nozzle being moved in a vertical plane away from said lateral horizontal plane parallel to said structural surface, subjecting said spray applicator source of said substance in liquid form to an arcuate uphill movement upon said respective arcuate, uphill opposite end portions of said track at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said spray applicator source of said substance in liquid form, wherein said transverse movement of said spray applicator source of said substance in liquid form accelerates in speed, alone said track, moving said spray application source of substance along said respective arcuate, uphill opposite end portion of said track in liquid form outward as said spray applicator source of said substance in liquid form moves arcuately uphill, and tilts, thereby reducing the amount of said substance in liquid form being applied to said respective edge portions of each said band of said substance upon the structural surface at an end of each pass of said spray applicator source across each said linearly extending band of said substance. 2. A method of applying a solid roofing polyurethane foam coating upon a structural surface, comprising the steps of: continuously applying said polyurethane foam in liquid form in adjacent axially extending bands of foam, said polyurethane foam being a coating of a resultant solid foam layer upon said structural surface, applying said coating from a foam applicator source moving in alternate directions along a track having a straight horizontal portion and respective arcuate uphill opposite end portion, said spray applicator source moving transverse to an axially extending direction of each band of said bands of said foam, each said band having a predetermined width and axial length, said applicator source moving laterally in a horizontal plane parallel to said structural surface, said nozzle being moved in a vertical plane away from said lateral horizontal plane parallel to said structural surface, subjecting said applicator source of polyurethane foam to an arcuate uphill movement upon said respective arcuate uphill opposite end portions of said track at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said applicator source of liquid form, wherein said transverse movement of said foam applicator source of liquid form accelerates in speed, moving said foam applicator source of liquid foam along said respective arcuately uphill opposite end portion of said track outward as said foam applicator source of liquid foam moves arcuately uphill; and tilts, thereby reducing the amount of said liquid foam applied to said respective edge portions of each said band of foam upon the roof at an end of each pass of said liquid foam applicator source across each said linearly extending band of foam. 3. The method as in claim 2 wherein said foam applicator source is a nozzle. 4. The method as in claim 3 wherein said step of applying said liquid foam in alternately directions transverse to an axially extending direction of each said band of said foam further comprises the step of moving said foam applicator source transversely along at least one track extending transverse to said axial direction of each said band of said liquid foam. 5. The method as in claim 4, wherein a radially extending swinging arm with a telescoping slide mechanism provides said transverse movement of said foam applicator source along said at least one track, so that said foam applicator source moves linearly, as said swinging arm pivots about a pivot fulcrum point. 6. The method as in claim 4 further comprising the steps of controlling the thickness of said liquid foam upon the structural surface by varying a rate of flow of discharge of said liquid foam emanating from said foam applicator source, whereby ground movement speed of said transverse movements of said foam applicator source determines the weight of said coating of foam per unit area applied, to determine the thickness of said resultant solid foam layer. 7. The method as in claim 6 further comprising the step of applying said polyurethane foam upon a slope of a drain on the portion of said resultant solid foam layer roof, by reducing ground movement speed of said foam applicator source on successive passes away and parallel to a drainage line of said drain, resulting in a stepwise slope approximating a predetermined contour of said drain. 8. The method as in claim 4 further comprising the step of tilting said foam applicator source a predetermined amount cyclically as said foam applicator source moves transversely along said track, thereby minimizing variation in foam thickness in the form of rounded ridges due to a hollow-cone pattern of the application of said liquid foam from said foam applicator source. 9. The method as in claim 4 further comprising the step of applying a layer of fabric from a fabric roll to said layer of liquid foam, thereby reinforcing said solid foam layer with said fabric layer, whereby during solidification of said liquid foam, said fabric layer becomes imbedded in said resultant solid foam layer. 10. The method as in claim 9 further comprising the step of applying an elastomeric sheet covering over said liquid foam layer, thereby forming a coating skin over said resultant solid foam layer. 11. A method of applying a solid roofing polyurethane foam layer upon a structural surface, comprising the steps of: continuously applying said substance in liquid form in adjacent linearly extending bands from a spray applicator source moving laterally in a horizontal plane parallel to said structural surface, comprising means for varying the distance between said spray applicator source and a structural surface target surface, said spray applicator source moving on a track in alternate directions transverse to an axial direction of each band, each said band having a predetermined width and axial length; and wherein said means for varying the distance between said spray applicator source and a structural surface target surface comprises subjecting said applicator source to an uphill movement by the bending of said track at each end portion of each said transverse movement of said applicator source; said foam applicator source being tilted outwardly by said track as said foam applicator source moves uphill on said track, said nozzle being moved in a vertical plane away from said lateral horizontal plane parallel to said structural surface, thereby reducing the amount of said liquid foam being applied to said respective edge portions of each said band of foam upon the roof at an end of each pass of said liquid foam applicator source across each said linearly extending band of foam.
