A system for providing cash to users in a self-service environment such as in dispensing motor fuel includes a self-service dispensing machine (12). A user is enabled to dispense merchandise from the self-service dispensing machine and is also enabled to selectively receive cash value by charging the amount of such value to a monetary source associated with a machine readable article (80, 82). A user may receive cash value by presenting a printed voucher or other item to a service provider located at a facility (14) at which the service provider exchanges the voucher or other item for cash. Alternatively, cash may be dispensed to the user directly from the self-service dispensing machine.
