A method for producing an anticoagulation effect in a blood coagulation assay, said method comprising contacting a sample of blood with an effective amount of apolipoprotein CIII or fragment, derivative, homologue, analogue, chemical equivalent, functional equivalent or mimetic thereof.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of a condition characterised by the aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate blood coagulation in a subject, said method comprising administering to said subject, an effective amount of a composition comprising apolipoprotein CIII or a lipid binding fragment of apolipoprotein CIII, wherein said lipid binding fragment of apolipoprotein CIII comprises amino acids 41-79 of apolipoprotein CIII. 2. The method according to claim 1 wherein said condition is selected from the group consisting of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation, cardiac valve replacement, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, ischemia-reperfusion injury and post-operative thromboembolism. 3. The method according to claim 1 where said subject is a mammal. 4. The method according to claim 3 wherein said mammal is a human. 5. The method according to claim 1 wherein said composition comprises additional active ingredients, wherein said additional active ingredients are an additional anticoagulant and/or a thrombolytic agent.
