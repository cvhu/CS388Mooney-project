A joining method directs polychromate, non-coherent electromagnetic radiation (14) through a radiation transmitting material (16) to an absorbing material (18) that absorbs the radiation with the generation of heat. The heat is used to heat a bond line (20) formed from the transmitting material (16) and a substrate (18) sufficiently to bond the transmitting material (16) and substrate (18). A radiation filter (22) of the same material as the transmitting material is used to reduce effectively unwanted absorption (and heat) in the transmitting material (16). Radiation focusing, masking, transmitting plastic cooling, bond line component drying, double pass welding, and additional bond line pressure are used to improve the bond of the resulting manufacture. A moving double radiation source units improves welding speed at least 5-6 times that of a moving single radiation source unit.
