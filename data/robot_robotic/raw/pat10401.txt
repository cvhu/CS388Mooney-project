A powder coating system particularly adapted for coating large objects such as automotive and other vehicle bodies comprises a spray booth having a manual/robotic spraying area for the application of powder to the inner door flanges and other hard to reach areas of the vehicle body using manually or rotatably operated powder dispensers, and an automatic spraying area wherein the remainder of the vehicle body is coated using automatically manipulated powder dispensers. A powder collection and recovery system is associated with the spray booth which includes removable cartridge filters arranged in V-shaped filter banks within powder collection chambers beneath the floor of the booth, a system for the transfer of powder collected in the powder collection chambers to hoppers located exteriorly of the booth and an air exhaust system for equalizing the negative pressure within clean air chambers which receive clean air after filtering by the cartridge filters.
Claims We claim: 1. The method of applying powder coating material onto an object, comprising: spraying powder coating material onto objects moving through the interior of a spray booth; drawing air and air-entrained, oversprayed powder material which does not adhere to the objects from the interior of the spray booth into a powder collection chamber; directing the powder entering the powder collection chamber through powder openings in a powder receiving device connected to the powder collection chamber so that the powder is collected within the interior of the powder receiving device; sealing the powder openings in the powder receiving device; and introducing pressurized air into the interior of the powder receiving device with its powder openings sealed to force the powder therein out of the powder receiving device and into a recovery means for storage or reuse. 2. The method of claim 1 in which said step of introducing pressurized air into the interior of the powder receiving device comprises forcing the powder within said powder receiving device into a header pipe, and then introducing a volume of pressurized air into the interior of the header pipe to force the powder therein into a hopper means located exteriorly of the spray booth. 3. The method of applying powder coating material onto objects, comprising: spraying powder coating material onto objects moving through the interior of a spray booth; drawing air and air-entrained, oversprayed powder material which does not adhere to the objects from the interior of the spray booth into a number of powder collection chambers wherein the oversprayed powder is collected and filtered from the air to form clean air; creating a negative pressure within a number of clean air chambers each connected to one of the powder collection chambers to draw the clean air into each clean air chamber; drawing the clean air out of each of the clean air chambers into a common clean air plenum; and initially adjusting the flow of clean air between each of the clean air chambers and the common clean air plenum so that the negative pressure within each of the clean air chambers is substantially equal. 4. The method of claim 3 in which said step of initially adjusting the flow of clean air between the clean air chambers and the common clean air plenum comprises adjusting a damper interposed between each clean air chamber and the common clean air plenum between an open position and a closed position so that the negative pressure within all clean air chambers is initially substantially equal. 5. The method of applying powder coating material onto objects, comprising: dispensing powder coating material onto objects moving through the interior of a spray booth; drawing air and air-entrained, oversprayed powder material which does not adhere to the objects from the interior of the spray booth into a number of powder collection chambers wherein the oversprayed powder is collected and filtered from the air by filters to form clean air for discharge into a number of clean air chambers each connected to the filters and to one of the powder collection chambers; creating a negative pressure within each of the clean air chambers to draw the filtered, clean air into the clean air chambers; drawing the clean air out of each of the clean air chambers into a common clean air plenum; initially adjusting the flow of clean air between each of the clean air chambers and the common clean air plenum so that the negative pressure within each of the clean air chambers is initially substantially equal; sensing the negative pressure within each of the clean air chambers as the oversprayed powder coating material is collected on the filters connected thereto; and dislodging the collected powder coating material from the filters connected to any one of the clean air chambers in the event the negative pressure sensed within such clean air chamber falls below a predetermined level.
