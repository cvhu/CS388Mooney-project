The capacity of a rack-mounted storage library having a media element handling assembly is expanded by mounting a panel segment to a rack side such that the panel segment faces the rack interior. At least one of media element housing cells and a media player are supported on the panel segment such that the cells and the player face the rack interior. The library capacity is increased by mounting another panel segment having cells or a player to another rack side. The panel segments are mounted to the rack sides independent of one another or are connected together prior to being mounted to the rack sides. The handling assembly moves through the rack interior to load media elements held by cells into a player. The panel segments may be mounted to the rack sides at the same or different rack length positions.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A rack-mounted storage library comprising: a four-sided rack having an interior and a length with spacings along the length of the rack; a media element handling assembly; a first segmented panel assembly removably plugged within a spacing of the rack at a first rack length position, the panel assembly having tear-apart first and second panels, each panel having first and second ends, the first ends of the panels being interconnected such that the panels are perpendicular to one another, each panel having an inner surface, wherein the panels are respectively mounted to first and second sides of the rack at the first rack length position with the inner surfaces of the panels facing the rack interior; and media element housing cells supported on the inner surfaces of the panels such that the housing cells face the rack interior at the first rack length position; wherein the handling assembly is operable for moving through the rack interior to the first rack length position to manipulate media elements held by the housing cells. 2. The library of claim 1 wherein: the panel assembly further includes a tear-apart third panel having first and second ends, the first end of the third panel being interconnected to the second end of the second panel such that the second and third panels are perpendicular to one another and the first and third panels are parallel to one another, the third panel having an inner surface, wherein the third panel is mounted to a third side of the rack at the first rack length position with the inner surface of the third panel facing the rack interior; and a media element player supported on the inner surface of the third panel such that the player faces the rack interior at the first rack length position; wherein the handling assembly is operable for moving through the rack interior to the first rack length position to load media elements held by the housing cells into the player. 3. The library of claim 1 wherein: a media element player is supported on the inner surface of the first panel such that the player faces the rack interior at the first rack length position; wherein the handling assembly is operable for moving through the rack interior to the first rack length position to load media elements held by the housing cells into the player. 4. The library of claim 1 further comprising: a second segmented panel assembly removably plugged within a spacing of the rack at a second rack length position, the second panel assembly having tear-apart first and second panels each having first and second ends with the first ends being interconnected such that the panels of the second panel assembly are perpendicular to one another, each panel of the second panel assembly having an inner surface, wherein the panels of the second panel assembly are respectively mounted to the first and second sides of the rack at the second rack length position with the inner surfaces of the panels of the second panel assembly facing the rack interior; media element housing cells supported on the inner surface of the panels of the second panel assembly such that the housing cells face the rack interior at the second rack length position; wherein the handling assembly is operable for moving through the rack interior to the second rack length position to manipulate media elements held by the housing cells. 5. The library of claim 4 wherein: the first and second rack length positions are adjacent to one another such that the first and second panel assemblies are adjacent to one another within the rack without touching one another, wherein the rack supports the weight of the panel assemblies without either panel assembly supporting the weight of the other panel assembly. 6. A rack-mounted storage library comprising: a four-sided rack having a vertically upright, rectangular form formed by top and bottom rack portions and four legs extending therebetween, the legs being placed at respective corners of the top and bottom rack portions, the legs forming a rectangular interior within the rack bounded by four rack sides; a media element handling assembly movably connected to the rack for moving through the rack interior; a first segmented panel assembly removably plugged to the rack at a first rack length position, the first panel assembly having tear-apart first and second panels each panel having first and second ends, the first ends of the panels being interconnected such that the panels are perpendicular to one another, each panel having an inner surface, wherein the panels are respectively mounted to first and second sides of the rack at the first rack length position with the inner surfaces of the panels facing the rack interior, the first panel assembly being void of hardware for moving the handling assembly; and media element housing cells supported on the inner surfaces of the panels such that the housing cells face the rack interior at the first rack length position; wherein the handling assembly moves through the rack interior to move to the first rack length position to manipulate media elements held by the housing cells. 7. The library of claim 6 further comprising: a second segmented panel assembly removably plugged to the rack at a second rack length position, the second panel assembly having tear-apart first and second panels each having first and second ends with the first ends being interconnected such that the panels of the second panel assembly are perpendicular to one another, each panel of the second panel assembly having an inner surface, wherein the panels of the second panel assembly are respectively mounted to the first and second sides of the rack at the second rack length position with the inner surfaces of the panels of the second panel assembly facing the rack interior; media element housing cells supported on the inner surface of the panels of the second panel assembly such that the housing cells face the rack interior at the second rack length position; wherein the handling assembly is operable for moving through the rack interior to the second rack length position to manipulate media elements held by the housing cells. 8. The library of claim 7 wherein: the first and second rack length positions are adjacent to one another such that the first and second panel assemblies are adjacent to one another without touching one another, wherein the rack supports the weight of the panel assemblies without either panel assembly supporting the weight of the other panel assembly.
