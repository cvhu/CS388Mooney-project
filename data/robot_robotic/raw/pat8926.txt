The present invention provides a wafer cassette generally comprising one or more wafer support plates defining two or more coplanar wafer seats, a movable stem supporting the wafer support plates, and an actuating member connected to the stem to move the wafer support plates.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A wafer cassette, comprising: (a) one or more wafer support plates defining two or more coplanar wafer seats; (b) a movable stem supporting the wafer support plates; and (c) an actuating member connected to the stem to move the wafer support plates. 2. The wafer cassette of claim 1 further comprising two or more channels formed in the wafer seats in which a wafer support rail is disposed. 3. The wafer cassette of claim 2 wherein the wafer support rail is comprised of a ceramic. 4. The wafer cassette of claim 1 wherein the wafer support plates are spaced from each other to allow a wafer handling blade to pass therebetween. 5. The wafer cassette of claim 4 wherein the wafer support plates include a central cooling passage formed in the wafer seats. 6. The wafer cassette of claim 5 wherein the wafer support plates are comprised of aluminum. 7. The wafer cassette of claim 6 wherein the wafer seats comprise an annular recess formed in the wafer support plates. 8. A wafer cassette, comprising: (a) one or more wafer support plates having one or more wafer seats disposed thereon; (b) two or more wafer support rails disposed on the wafer seats to support a wafer above the wafer support plates, and (c) two or more channels formed in each wafer seat wherein the wafer support rails are disposed. 9. The wafer cassette of claim 8 wherein the wafer seats are comprised of an annular recess formed in the wafer support plates. 10. The wafer cassette of claim 9 further comprising a passage formed in the annular recess. 11. The wafer cassette of claim 10 wherein the passage is centrally disposed in the annular recess.
