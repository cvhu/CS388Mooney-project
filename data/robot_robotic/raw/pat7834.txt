Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of C/EBP alpha. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding C/EBP alpha. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of C/EBP alpha expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of C/EBP alpha are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 19, 20, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 73, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 92 or 94 which inhibits the expression of human or mouse C/EBP alpha. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human or mouse C/EBP alpha in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human or mouse C/EBP alpha is inhibited.
