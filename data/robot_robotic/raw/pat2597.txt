An annuloplasty system for repairing incompetent heart valves is provided. This system includes a substantially circular valve reinforcing device adapted to be surgically implanted into around a heart valve annulus; anchoring means for attaching the substantially circular valve reinforcing device to the heart valve, wherein attaching the substantially circular valve reinforcing device to the heart valve annulus reduces the circumference of the heart valve annulus by plicating annular tissue underneath the valve reinforcing device; and constricting means for, if necessary, reducing the circumference of the substantially circular valve reinforcing device, wherein reducing the circumference of the substantially circular valve reinforcing device further reduces the circumference of the heart valve annulus.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An annuloplasty system for repairing incompetent heart valves, comprising: (a) an adjustable heart valve reinforcing device adapted to be surgically implanted around a heart valve annulus and to reduce the circumference thereof by plicating annular tissue underneath the heart valve reinforcing device, wherein the valve reinforcing device includes: (i) a plurality of individual suture support components, wherein the plurality of suture support components includes: a) at least one anchor component, wherein the at least one anchor component further includes at least two channels passing lengthwise therethrough; and b) a plurality of intermediate components adapted to be implanted into the heart valve annulus after the anchor component, wherein each intermediate component further includes at least two channels passing lengthwise therethrough; and (b) anchoring means for attaching each individual suture support component in the plurality of suture support components around the heart valve annulus, wherein the anchoring means is integrated into each suture support component prior to implantation of the heart valve reinforcing device around a heart valve annulus, and wherein the anchoring means includes: (i) at least two sutures pre-attached to the at least one anchor component, wherein at least one of the sutures includes a surgical needle attached thereto; and (ii) at least two sutures pre-attached to each of the plurality of the intermediate components wherein at least one of the sutures includes a surgical needle attached thereto; and (c) constricting means for reducing the circumference of the adjustable heart valve reinforcing device, wherein a portion the constricting means passes through each individual suture support component and is operative to further reduce the circumference of the adjustable heart valve reinforcing device following implantation thereof around a heart valve annulus, and wherein the constricting means includes: (i) at least two supportive drawstrings, wherein one end of each drawstring is attached to one end of the at least one anchor component, wherein the drawstrings pass through the two channels in each intermediate component, and wherein the ends of the drawstrings are tied together over a final individual suture support component after the heart valve repair is completed. 2. The annuloplasty system of claim 1, wherein the supportive drawstrings comprise suture material, biodegradable suture material, a Teflon strip, a band, a filament, a wire, a strap, or combinations thereof. 3. The annuloplasty system of claim 1, wherein the individual suture support components are rigid or semi-rigid and are cylindrical, tubular, square, round, oval, or combinations thereof. 4. The annuloplasty system of claim 1, wherein the individual suture support components are rigid or semi-rigid and resist bucking when the anchoring means are tied and reduce the potential of over-plication of annular tissue underneath the suture support components when the anchoring means are tied. 5. The annuloplasty system of claim 1, wherein the individual suture support components are radio-opaque, inert, non-corrosive, non-thrombogenic, and biocompatible with blood and tissue. 6. The annuloplasty system of claim 1, wherein the individual suture support components further include a textured surface or coating for promoting tissue in-growth and reducing thromboembolism. 7. The annuloplasty system of claim 1, wherein the each of the plurality of individual suture support components includes at least one suture stored therein. 8. A method for surgically implanting the annuloplasty system of claim 1, comprising: (a) utilizing the anchoring means for securing the valve reinforcing device to the heart valve annulus, wherein securing the valve reinforcing device to the heart valve annulus reduces the circumference of the annulus by plicating annular tissue underneath the valve reinforcing device, and wherein utilizing the anchoring means further includes: (i) affixing the at least one anchor component to a dilated heart valve annulus by passing one of the surgical needles attached to the sutures on the at least one anchor component through the heart valve annulus; (ii) pulling the suture and surgical needle which has passed through the heart annulus until the at least one anchor component aligns with the heart valve annulus; (iii) securing the at least one anchor component to the heart valve annulus by tying the ends of the sutures on the at least one anchor component together; (iv) using the supportive drawstrings to guide one of the plurality of intermediate components through a minimally-invasive tube or small incision to the position above the heart valve annulus adjacent to the at least one anchor component; (v) affixing one of the plurality of intermediate components to the heart valve annulus by passing one of the surgical needles attached to the sutures on one of the plurality of intermediate components through the heart valve annulus; (vi) pulling the surgical needle and suture which has passed through the heart annulus until one of the plurality of intermediate components aligns with the heart valve annulus; (vii) securing one of the plurality of intermediate components to the heart valve annulus by tying the ends of the sutures on one of the plurality of intermediate components together; (viii) repeating steps (iv)-(vii) until the desired circumference around the heart valve annulus is covered by the plurality of intermediate components; and (ix) testing the annuloplasty system to verify that appropriate constriction has been achieved; and (b) utilizing the constricting means to reduce the circumference of the valve reinforcing device, wherein reducing the circumference of the valve reinforcing device further reduces the circumference of the heart valve annulus by plicating the annular tissue between adjacent components of the valve reinforcing device, and wherein utilizing the constricting means further includes: (x) pulling both ends of the supportive drawstrings to the desired tension to further decrease the circumference of the heart valve annulus; and (xi) tying the ends of the supportive drawstrings around the final individual suture support component.
