A system and method for sensing and compensating for unintended joint movement of a robotic arm caused by application of a load. The system may have a plurality of external encoders each in intimate contact with an external edge portion of one of a plurality of robotic arm joints to sense joint movement caused by application of the load, and a computing device configured for calculating a compensation amount based on the sensed joint movement and sending the calculated compensation amount to a corresponding robot motor encoder to correct the position of the joint by the compensation amount. The method may comprise applying the load one portion at a time, such that a portion of the load is applied, the compensation amount is calculated, the position of the joint is corrected, and then the process repeats, with another portion of the load applied to the robotic arm.
