The present invention relates to fungal histidine kinases. In particular, the present invention is directed to histidine kinases from Neurospora (e.g., N. crassa), Candida (e.g, C. albicans), and Aspergillus (e.g., A. fumigatus), and related compositions. Furthermore, the present invention provides compositions and methods for the identification of compounds having antifungal activity, as well as compositions and methods for the treatment of fungal infections.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:35, and its fully complementary sequence. 2. A composition comprising the nucleotide sequence of claim 1. 3. An isolated nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:34, SEQ ID NO:36, and their fully complementary sequences. 4. A composition comprising the nucleotide sequence of claim 3. 5. A vector comprising the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:35. 6. The vector of claim 5, wherein said vector is an expression vector. 7. A host cell containing the vector of claim 5, where said host cell is selected from the group consisting of prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. 8. An isolated nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes to the complement of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:36 under stringent conditions in 0.5 M NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4, pH 7.2, containing 5% SDS at 65.degree. C. overnight, followed by washing once in 40 mM Na.sub.2 HPO.sub.4, containing 5% SDS, and once in 40 mM Na.sub.2 HPO.sub.4 containing 1% SDS, wherein said nucleotide sequence encodes a protein having histidine kinase activity, and the complement of said nucleotide sequence.
