Disclosed is a method and system for compensating for the load a part places on a part positioner system that positions the part for work operations by a robot. The part positioner system rotates a part holding assembly about the axis of rotation of a shoulder drive. The part holding assembly may have a column that extends perpendicular to the shoulder center line. A counter weight system is incorporated into the column that includes a counter weight pack that is moved along the length of the column. The shoulder drive drives the part and part holding assembly load in order to measure a torque applied to the shoulder drive. A load offset may be calculated based on the applied torque. The counter weight pack may then be moved to a position on the column calculated to balance the load of the part and part holding assembly. Alternatively, the counter weight may be moved empirically in a feedback loop in response to repeated torque measurements of the shoulder drive until an optimum torque is achieved at the shoulder drive.
