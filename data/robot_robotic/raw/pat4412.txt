Various embodiments of roller hemming apparatus and methods are disclosed including one wherein multiple rollers are carried on a single mount to hem a flange in a single pass, another including induction heating and air quenching means movable with a roller to anneal the flange just prior to hem forming, and another in which friction from a rotatably driven roller heats the flange to reduce bending stresses during hemming of the flange.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for roller hemming together edges of at least two metal panels to form an edge hemmed panel assembly, the method comprising: positioning at least first and second metal panels with edges aligned in mated face engagement, the first panel having a flange portion bent from the mated edge of the first panel across and beyond the mated edge of the second panel; providing hemming apparatus having a roller hemming portion operable in a process capable of completing a finished edge hem in at least one pass of relative motion along the length of the mated edge of the panels wherein the flange portion of the first panel is folded over in a gradual bend from one end to another of the mated edges to effectively engage the flange with an outer side of the mated edge portion of the second panel and thereby maintain the panels in an assembly; wherein the hemming portion included a mount carrying annealing apparatus and at least a final roller positioned to serially operate on the flange portion as the mount is traversed along the length of the mated edges such that the annealing apparatus heats and quenches the flange prior to bending toward the second panel and the final roller finishes folding of the flange against the second panel to form the finished hem, the gradual folding of the flange being completed in at least one pass of the mount with the rollers moving from one end to an opposite end of the mated edges of the panels; and operating the apparatus according to said process to complete a finished hem of the mated edges of the panels; wherein the annealing apparatus includes an induction coil and an air quenching knife positioned to carry out further method steps of sequentially induction heating and then air cooling the flange portion to relieve internal stresses in the flange portion prior to bending by the final roller; and wherein the apparatus includes pivoting arms supporting the induction coil, and guide rollers operative to maintain the induction coil in a desired position relative to the flange portion to provide a desired heating of the flange portion prior to the quenching step. 2. A method for roller hemming together edges of at least two metal panels to form an edge hemmed panel assembly, the method comprising: positioning at least first and second metal panels with edges aligned in mated face engagement, the first panel having a flange portion bent from the mated edge of the first panel across and beyond the mated edge of the second panel; providing hemming apparatus having a roller hemming portion operable in a process capable of completing a finished edge hem in at least one pass of relative motion along the length of the mated edges of the panels wherein the flange portion of the first panel is folded over in a gradual bend from one end to another of the mated edges to effectively engage the flange with an outer side of the mated edge portion of the second panel and thereby maintain the panels in an assembly; wherein the hemming portion includes a mount carrying a motor driven roller, and the method further includes: engaging the flange with the roller, including a curved portion of the bend, while rotatably driving the roller to heat the flange by friction sufficiently to enable sharper bending of the flange in a final pass without cracking; and traversing the roller along the length of the flange while continuing rotation of the roller to gradually fold over the flange from one end to another to form a flat hem while the temperature of the flange at the location of folding remains at a level of increased formability. 3. Roller hemming apparatus for attaching panel edges in face to face assembly by folding a flange portion adjacent an edge of one panel over a mated edge of another panel to form a hemmed panel assembly, the apparatus comprising: a hemming portion having at least one roller capable of completing a finished edge hem along the length of the mated edges of the panels wherein the flange portion of the first panel is folded over in a gradual bend from one end to another end of the mated edges to effectively engage the flange with an outer side of the mated edge portion of the second panel and thereby maintain the panels in an assembly; wherein the hemming portion includes a mount carrying annealing apparatus and at least a final roller positioned to serially operate on the flange portion as the mount is traversed along the length of the mated edge such that the annealing apparatus heat and quenches the flange and the final roller thereafter finishes folding of the flange against the second panel to form the finished hem, the gradual folding of the flange being completed with the roller moving from one end to an opposite end of the mated edges of the panels; wherein the annealing apparatus includes an induction coil and an air quenching knife positioned to carry out method steps of sequentially induction heating and then cooling the flange portion to relieve internal stresses in the flange portion prior to bending by the final roller; wherein the apparatus includes pivoting arms supporting the induction coil, and guide rollers operative to maintain the induction coil in a desired position relative to the flange portion to provide a desired heating of the flange portion prior to the quenching step. 4. Roller hemming apparatus for attaching panel edges in face to face assembly by folding a flange portion adjacent an edge of one panel over a mated edge of another panel to form a hemmed panel assembly, the apparatus comprising: a hemming portion having at least one roller capable of completing a finished edge hem along the length of the mated edges of the panels wherein the flange portion of the first panel is folded over in a gradual bend from one end to another end of the mated edges to effectively engage the flange with an outer side of the mated edge portion of the second panel and thereby maintain the panels in an assembly; wherein the hemming portion includes a motor connected to rotatably drive the roller to create friction heating and the roller is shaped with a flared shoulder portion adapted to engage the bend portion of the flange to concentrate heating of the flange in the bend portion during rolling of the flange.
