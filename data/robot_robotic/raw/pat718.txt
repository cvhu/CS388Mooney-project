A method of diagnosing a disease that includes obtaining experimental data on gene selections. The gene selection functions to characterize a cancer when the expression of that gene selection is compared to the identical selection from a noncancerous cell or a different type of cancer cell. The invention also includes a method of targeting at least one product of a gene that includes administration of a therapeutic agent. The invention also includes the use of a gene selection for diagnosing a cancer.
