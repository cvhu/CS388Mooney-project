A fixture for in-situ chemical etch monitoring of an etching process during etching of at least one wafer contained in a wafer carrier is disclosed. The fixture comprises a set of primary guide members for engaging and guiding a front portion of the wafer carrier. A set of rear guide members engages and guides a rear portion of the wafer carrier. A set of electrode arms is included for receiving a respective electrode and corresponding electrode wire thereon. A mounting plate establishes a prescribed spacing of the set of primary guide members with respect to the set of electrode arms. A means for self-locking the first wafer contained in the wafer boat is connected to the mounting plate and further positioned in a prescribed manner with respect to the set of primary guide members and the set of electrode arms. Lastly, a connecting means connects the mounting plate, the set of primary guide members, and the set of electrode arms to the set of rear guide members, whereby insertion of the wafer boat into the fixture establishes a prescribed distance between the set of electrode arms and the first wafer, and further wherein the first wafer is passively fixed by the self-locking means.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A fixture for in-situ chemical etch monitoring of an etching process during etching of at least one wafer contained in a wafer carrier, one of the at least one wafers being positioned in a first slot of the wafer carrier, said fixture comprising: a) a set of primary guide members for engaging and guiding a front portion of the wafer carrier; b) a set of rear guide members for engaging and guiding a rear portion of the wafer carrier; c) a set of electrode arms for receiving a respective electrode and corresponding electrode wire thereon; d) a mounting plate for establishing spacing of said set of primary guide members with respect to said set of electrode arms; e) a means for self-locking the first wafer contained in the wafer carrier, said self-locking means connected to said mounting plate and further positioned in a manner with respect to said set of primary guide members and said set of electrode arms; and f) means for connecting said mounting plate, said set of primary guide members, said set of electrode arms to said set of rear guide members, whereby insertion of the wafer carrier into the fixture establishes a distance between the set of electrode arms and the first wafer, and further wherein the first wafer is passively fixed by said self-locking means.
