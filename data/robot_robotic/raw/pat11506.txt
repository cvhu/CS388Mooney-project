Contact insertion and wire lay apparatus for manufacture of wire harnesses which provides for insertion of a contact affixed to the trailing end of a wire segment after wire lay. The invention provides for gripping a wire segment while the segment is caused to lay in a desired configuration. A pair of sets of tip jaws enable forward and trailing end contacts of the wire segment to be inserted into selected contact holding devices. In addition, the apparatus is arranged to facilitate lateral receipt and rejection of the wire segments.
Claims We claim: 1. A contact insertion and wire lay apparatus, comprising: a collar capable of cooperative engagement with a robot arm; means coupled to said collar for receiving a wire segment which has a first and second contact affixed thereto, said receiving means including a housing defining an upper and a lower housing section, said sections defining a longitudinal wire-access slot therebetween; means coupled to said housing for manipulating said received wire segment into a desired layout, said manipulating means including a drive belt and at least one drive roller; a plurality of auxiliary wire grips for gripping said wire segment, said auxiliary wire grips being in the form of an upper pair of grips pivotally coupled to said upper housing section and a lower pair of grips pivotally coupled to said lower housing section, a first one of said upper and of said lower pair of grips capable of cooperating to grip said wire segment therebetween and a second one of said upper and of said lower pair of grips capable of cooperating to grip said wire segment therebetween; and means for rotating said receiving means; and first means coupled to said housing for inserting said first contact of said wire segment into a first connector, and second means coupled to said housing for inserting said second contact of said wire segment into a second connector, wherein each of said inserting means includes a pair of tip jaws defining a wire-segment recess therebetween. 2. A contact insertion and wire lay apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said means for rotating said receiving means is capable of rotating said receiving means with respect to said collar.
