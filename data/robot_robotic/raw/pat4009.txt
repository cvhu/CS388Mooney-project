A sample processing system (101) that may be automated and methods are disclosed where samples) (198) are arranged on a carrier element (197) and a process operation control system (171) automatically processes the samples) perhaps robotically with an operationally-influential exteriorly-consequential information monitor (402) or a data capture element (414). Significant process details as well as operationally-influential exteriorly-consequential information may be monitored and an automatic notice element (404) may cause notification of a person at some display (415) that may be remote. Various people may be notified, such as an administrator, a supplier, or a manufacturer of an opportunity for some action such as reagent reordering or the like. A simulated motion display may be included to "watch" simulated operation in real time or long after completion of the actual processing.
