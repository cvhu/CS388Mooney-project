In a microvolume liquid handling system, a system reservoir is connected with tubing to a pressure control system for controlling the liquid system pressure in the system reservoir. The system reservoir is coupled to one or more microdispensers through a distribution tube having a branched section for each microdispenser. In this embodiment, each microdispenser is coupled to its own flow sensor and to enable a system controller to respectively measure and control the flow of liquid in the each microdispenser.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A microvolume liquid handling system for dispensing small quantities of liquids, comprising: a system liquid reservoir containing a system liquid; a pressure control system having a pump capable of increasing or decreasing pressure of said system liquid in said system liquid reservoir; a hollow tube connecting said pressure control system to said system liquid reservoir; a distribution tube having at least one section; a microdispenser having a capillary portion for dispensing droplets of a transfer liquid through a nozzle and a constricting portion for constricting said capillary portion; a valve coupled at a first end to said system liquid reservoir through one section of said distribution tube, said valve coupled at a second end to said microdispenser; a sensor coupled to said section of said distribution tube, said sensor capable of detecting at least one of either pressure or flow of system liquid in said distribution tube and generating a corresponding signal; and a system controller coupled to said valve to control said valve, said system controller coupled to said sensor to receive said signal, said system controller coupled to said pressure control system to direct said pressure control system to increase or decrease pressure in said system liquid, and said system controller being coupled to said constricting portion to activate said constricting portion. 2. The microvolume liquid handling system for dispensing small quantities of liquids of claim 1, wherein said constricting portion is capable of being constricted at a frequency sufficiently high to dislodge foreign material adhering to said microdispenser. 3. The microvolume liquid handling system of claim 1 wherein said constricting portion of said microdispenser is capable of vibrating said microdispenser at a frequency sufficiently high to dislodge foreign material adhering to interior surfaces of said microdispenser.
