The conveyor system for clinical test apparatus includes a main transport conveyor and a plurality of auxiliary conveyors located alongside the main transport conveyor. The auxiliary conveyors define straight line paths of travel parallel to the straight line paths of travel of the main conveyor. Each of the auxiliary conveyors is operated by drive means separate from the main transport conveyor. Two crossover points are provided between the main transport conveyor and the auxiliary conveyor. One crossover point is an entrance from the main transport conveyor to the auxiliary conveyor and the other crossover point is an exit from the auxiliary conveyor to the main transport conveyor. Each crossover point is controlled by a gate. One of the gates is a divert gate which can be actuated to block the main transport path thereby diverting puck traffic onto the auxiliary conveyor. The other gate is an interface gate which is used primarily to read information on a sample tube before it is introduced into a test apparatus and also functions as a load and unload station for the clinical test apparatus. The conveyor system also has a main unload and load system wherein tubes that have been completely tested are removed from pucks and reloaded with new tubes that are to be tested.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A conveyor system for clinical test apparatus comprising, a) a main transport conveyor defining a closed circuit path of travel in a generally horizontal plane, the closed circuit path of travel permitting objects on the conveyor to repeat the path of travel when the conveyor is moving in one direction, the closed circuit path of travel including a straight line path and a curved path, b) an auxiliary conveyor defining a straight line path of travel in a generally horizontal plane, the straight line path of travel permitting objects on the conveyor to move from one point to another without retracing any point of travel when the conveyor is moving in said one direction, said auxiliary conveyor having an upstream end and a downstream end relative to said one direction of movement, c) said auxiliary conveyor being positioned alongside the straight line path of travel of said first transport conveyor to run in the same direction as said first conveyor, d) segregation means between the straight line path of said main transport conveyor and said auxiliary conveyor for normally preventing objects from said transport conveyor from moving onto said auxiliary conveyor and vice versa, e) said segregation means including first and second openings spaced a predetermined linear distance from each other along said straight line path, f) a divert gate device provided at one of said openings proximate an upstream end of said auxiliary conveyor, said divert gate device having diversion means for diverting movement of objects on said main transport conveyor through said one of said openings in said segregation means to said auxiliary conveyor, g) an interface gate provided downstream of said one opening and upstream of said other opening in said segregation means, and h) said other opening providing a flow path that leads directly from said auxiliary conveyor to said main transport conveyor, wherein said divert gate has a first protractible and retractable hold back means having a protracted position for holding back the movement of objects on said main transport conveyor as said objects approach said divert gate, said first hold back means being operable independently of said diversion means, and wherein said divert gate includes a second protractible and retractible hold back means having a protracted position for holding back the movement of objects on said main transport conveyor, said first and second hold back means being spaced a predetermined amount from each other to constitute a singulator means for singulating an object. 2. The conveyor system as claimed in claim 1 including automatic label reading means co-operable with said divert gate and said singulator means for reading a label on an object that is singulated at said divert gate by said first and second hold back means.
