The expandable magnetic tape cartridge storage system is designed to handle a moderate number of magnetic tape cartridges and is expandable without the need to add an additional robotic cartridge handling mechanism. This is accomplished by the use of a base module that consists of a half cylinder of magnetic tape cartridge storage locations. A center pivot robotic cartridge handling mechanism is included in the base module in order to transport the magnetic tape cartridges between the cartridge storage locations and a plurality of magnetic tape drives included in the base module. The capacity of this cartridge storage system can be increased by adding an additional half cylinder of magnetic tape cartridge storage locations to thereby create a complete cylinder of cartridge storage locations. The robotic cartridge storage mechanism is adaptable to operate in a half cylinder or a full cylinder environment to thereby accommodate the storage capacity increase without the need for additional robotic cartridge handling mechanisms. This cartridge storage system can also be used to expand the cartridge storage capacity of an existing automated cartridge storage system in moderate increments.
Claims We claim: 1. An expandable object handling apparatus for retrieving objects from a plurality of object storage structures, wherein a first configuration of said apparatus comprises: a first substantially semi-cylindrical array of said object storage structures, said first substantially cylindrical array of object storage structures having a center point and including n columns of object storage structures, each of said columns of object storage structures containing a plurality of vertically stacked radially inwardly disposed object storage structures; means for removing one of said objects from a selected one of said object storage structures; and means, centered on said center point and rotatable about said center point, for positioning said removing means juxtaposed to said selected one of id object storage structures in a selected one of said columns of said object storage structures to retrieve said objects in a radially inwardly direction from said selected one of said object storage structures; and wherein a second configuration of said apparatus further comprises: a second substantially semi-cylindrical array of object storage structures, including less than n said columns of object storage structures radially disposed bout said center point, each of said columns of said object storage structures containing a plurality of vertically stacked radially inwardly disposed said object storage structures, said second substantially cylindrical array of object storage structures being juxtaposed to said first plurality of object storage structures to form a substantially cylindrical array of said object storage structures. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising: means for rigidly interconnecting said first semi-cylindrical array and said second semi-cylindrical array of structures to form said substantially cylindrical array of structures. 3. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising: at least one cartridge access port means placed in at least one of said less than n said columns of object storage structures in said second semi-cylindrical array of object storage structures and radially inwardly disposed, for manually inputting and outputting said objects into/out of said expandable object handling apparatus. 4. An expandable object handling apparatus for retrieving object from a plurality of object storage structures comprising: a first plurality of object storage structures configured in a substantially semi-cylindrical array having a center point; means for removing one of said objects from a selected one of said first plurality of object storage structures; means, located at said center point and rotatable about said center point, for positioning said removing means juxtaposed to said object storage structures to retrieve said objects from said selected object storage locations, wherein a first configuration of said apparatus comprises: positioning arm means having a first end and a selection end, distal from said first end and connected to said removing means, pivot means, centered on said center point and connected to said first end of said positioning arm means, for rotating said positioning arm means bout said center point to position said removing means juxtaposed to said selected object storage locations to retrieve said objects from said selected object storage locations; at least one means or using said objects retrieved from said object storage structures; a second plurality of said object storage structures configured in a substantially semi-cylindrical array about said center point, juxtaposed to said first plurality of object storage structures to form a substantially cylindrical array of said object structures in said expandable object handling apparatus; and at least one access pot means located in said cylindrical array for manually inputting and outputting said objects into/out of said expandable object handling apparatus. 5. An expandable object handling apparatus for retrieving objects from a plurality of object storage structures comprising: a first substantially semi-cylindrical array of object storage structures, said first substantially cylindrical array of object storage structures having a center point and including n columns of object storage structure, each of said columns of object storage structures containing a plurality of vertically us tacked radially inwardly disposed said object storage structures; means for removing one of said objects form a selected one of said object storage structures; means, centered on said enter point and rotatable about said center point, for positioning said removing means juxtaposed to said selected one of said object storage structures in a selected one of said columns of said object storage structures to retrieve one of said objects in a radially inwardly direction from said selected one of said object storage structures, comprising: positioning arm means having a first end and a second end, distal from said first end and connected to said removing means, pivot means, centered on a center point and connected to said first end of said positioning arm means to align said positioning arm in said radial direction, for rotating said positioning arm means about said center point to position said removing means juxtaposed to said selected one of said object storage locations to retrieve said object from said selected one of said object storage locations; a second substantially semi-cylindrical array of object storage structures, including less than n said columns of object storage structures radially disposed about said center point, each of said columns of object storage structures containing a plurality of vertically stacked radially inwardly disposed object storage structures, said second substantially cylindrical array of object storage structures being juxtaposed to said first plurality of object storage structures to form a substantially cylindrical array of object storage structures in said expandable object handling apparatus; at least one means, placed in at least one of said columns of object storage structures and radially inwardly disposed, for using said objects retrieved from said object storage structures; and at least one cartridge access port means placed in at least one of said columns of object storage structures and radially inwardly disposed, for manually inputting and outputting objects into/out of said expandable object handling apparatus.
