A system for dispensing pulverulent coating material comprises a source of pulverulent coating material, a source of compressed gas, a device for movably supporting a nozzle, the nozzle coupled to the source of pulverulent material and providing an opening through which the pulverulent material is dispensed, a deflector supported by the device and spaced from the opening to aid in shaping a cloud of dispensed coating material, and a source of high-magnitude electrostatic potential coupled to impart electrostatic potential to the dispensed pulverulent material. The deflector includes at least one first passageway extending with a radial component of the deflector and communicating with the source of compressed gas to direct gas with a radial component into the cloud of dispensed coating material.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for dispensing pulverulent coating material in a direction toward an article to be coated by the dispensed pulverulent coating material, the system consisting essentially of: a source of pulverulent coating material; a source of compressed gas; a nozzle coupled to the source of pulverulent material, the nozzle providing an opening through which the pulverulent material is dispensed; a source of high-magnitude electrostatic potential coupled to impart electrostatic potential to the dispensed pulverulent material; a deflector spaced from the opening to aid in shaping a cloud of dispensed coating material, the deflector including a flat front surface facing in the direction toward an article to be coated by the dispensed pulverulent coating material; a hub including a front surface and a skirt, the hub mounted to the front surface of the deflector so that the skirt abuts the front surface of the deflector creating a gallery behind the front surface of the hub and within the skirt, the gallery being in communication with the source of compressed gas, the hub including at least one first passageway extending with a radial component and communicating with the source of compressed gas, the at least one first passageway extending through the skirt from the gallery to the exterior of the hub parallel to the front surface of the deflector when the hub is mounted to the deflector, the hub including a rearward threaded section to mount the hub to a complementary threaded region of the deflector. 2. A system for dispensing pulverulent coating material in a direction toward an article to be coated by the dispensed pulverulent coating material, the system consisting essentially of: a source of pulverulent coating material; a source of compressed gas; a device for movably supporting a nozzle, the nozzle coupled to the source of pulverulent material, the nozzle providing an opening through which the pulverulent material is dispensed; the device further supporting a deflector spaced from the opening to aid in shaping a cloud of dispensed coating material, the deflector including a flat front surface facing in the direction toward an article to be coated by the dispensed pulverulent coating material; a source of high-magnitude electrostatic potential coupled to impart electrostatic potential to the dispensed pulverulent material; a hub including a front surface, a skirt, and at least one first passageway extending with a radial component communicating with the source of compressed gas to direct gas with a radial component into the cloud of dispensed coating material, the hub mounted to the front surface of the deflector so that the skirt abuts the front surface of the deflector creating a gallery behind the front surface of the hub and within the skirt, the at least one first passageway extending through the skirt from the gallery to the exterior of the hub parallel to the front surface of the deflector when the hub is mounted to the deflector, the hub including a rearward threaded section to mount the hub to a complementary threaded region of the deflector.
