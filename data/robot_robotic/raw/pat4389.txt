A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system for managing and identifying locations for an RFID reader is disclosed. An expected location of a fixed radio frequency identification (RFID) reader is determined. A first signal is transmitted from the reader to a first RFID tag to determine whether the reader is at the expected location. The first tag is a fiducial RFID tag fixed at a first location. In one aspect, the reader receives a first response to the first signal from the first tag. The first response identifies the first location of the first tag. The first location is compared to the expected location. If the first location and the expected location are different, an alarm is triggered.
