A robotic parts handler system for removing containers filled with articles from a sorting, feeding and/or stacking apparatus such as a mail or package sorting apparatus, and moving the container to a selected location for insertion into another conveying system, transport device, carrier, or other apparatus at extremely high speeds.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic parts handling system, comprising: a platform forming a base including at least one linear servo magnetic motor affixed to and extending along the side beneath said platform; a track including a first master rail and a second minor balancing rail; a plurality of supporting rollers supporting and holding said platform to said first master rail and said second minor balancing rail; a plurality of magnets mounted along the length of said first master rail for cooperative magnetic engagement with said at least one linear servo magnetic motor; a plurality of positioning rollers mounted to said platform for maintaining a constant distance between said linear servo magnetic motor and said magnets mounted to said first master rail; a computer control unit; means in close proximity to said rail for generating pulses readable by a reader in communication with said control unit for positioning said platform at selected positions upon said rail; a frame mounted upon said platform including at least one pair of vertical rails spaced apart from and in alignment with one another; a pair of slide members each one including a plurality of rollers cooperatively engaging said vertical rails; means extending along said vertical rails in cooperative engagement with said slide members for moving said slide members up and down independently of one another along the vertical-axis; a saddle having distal ends extending in between said vertical rails attaching to said slide members, said saddle being tiltable from side to side and from front to back; means for tilting said saddle from front to back about a longitudinal axis of said saddle. at least one end effector mounted onto said saddle including means for engaging and removing a container from a preselected position on one side of said platform and transferring said container to the opposite side of the platform and positioning and releasing said container in a selected location.
