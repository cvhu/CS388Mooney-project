Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of CoREST. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding CoREST. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of CoREST expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of CoREST are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 20 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding CoREST (SEQ ID NO:11), wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid molecule encoding CoREST (SEO ID NO:11) and inhibits the expression of CoREST, wherein said compound is an antisense oligonucleotide and has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:80. 2. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 4. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 5. The compound of claim 4 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 7. The compound of claim 6 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5 -methylcytosine. 8. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 9. An antisense compound 20 to 50 nucleobase in length which specifically hybridizes with nucleobases 48225 to 48244 of a nucleic acid molecule encoding CoREST (SEQ ID NO: 11) and which inhibits expression of CoREST. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 furter comprising a colloidal dispersion system.
