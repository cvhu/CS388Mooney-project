An improved force transducer which may, for example, be used as a joystick control for computer display control. Co-planar strain gauges are configured for response to forces applied in each of three orthogonal directions. A post and underlying ceramic substrate, the latter having the strain gauges mounted thereon, are mounted to a printed circuit board by means of a conductive epoxy or solder in a gap between the substrate and the circuit board. A retainer may be used to limit the extent of post displacement in X and Y directions to prevent damage to the assembly from forces which would otherwise exceed the physical limits thereof.
Claims I claim: 1. A force transducer for generating an electrical response dependent upon the magnitude and direction of an applied force, the transducer comprising: a post and a substrate to which the post is affixed at a first end, a second end of said post being free; a plurality of strain gauges each mounted on said substrate adjacent said post at a selected location and configured for changing resistance in response to a force applied to said post, said resistance changes among said strain gauges being dependent on the magnitude and direction of said force in each of three orthogonal directions; and wherein said three orthogonal directions include two directions in a first plane and a third direction in a second plane and wherein at least some of said plurality of strain gauges measure forces applied to said post in said first plane during a first period of time and measure forces applied to said post in said first plane during a first period of time and measure forces applied to said post in said second plane during a second period of time; said transducer further comprising switches for configuring said strain gauges in a first configuration during said first period of time and in a second configuration during said second period of time and alternatively switching between said first and second configurations thereafter. 2. A force transducer for generating an electrical response dependent upon the magnitude and direction of an applied force, the transducer comprising: a post and a substrate to which the post is affixed at a first end, a second end of said post being free; and a plurality of strain gauges each mounted on said substrate adjacent said post at a selected location and configured for changing resistance in response to a force applied to said post, said resistance changes among said strain gauges being dependent on the magnitude and direction of said force; a printed circuit board, said substrate being affixed to said printed circuit board by a conductive material while said conductive material is semi-viscous, said conductive material being hardened thereafter; and wherein said conductive material being configured to leave a gap beneath said substrate adjacent said post.
