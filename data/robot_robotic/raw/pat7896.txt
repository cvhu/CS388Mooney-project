Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of MEKK2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding MEKK2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of MEKK2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of MEKK2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid encoding MEKK2, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid encoding MEKK2 and inhibits the expression of MEKK2. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NOS: 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79 or 81. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of MEKK2 in cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of MEKK2 is inhibited.
