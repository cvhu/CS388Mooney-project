Devices for monitoring, calibrating and maintaining a manufacturing robot. The first device comprises a reference pin mounted to a first member and a reference aperture located on a second adjacent member wherein the reference pin is inserted into the reference aperture when the two members are at their zero reference location. A second device checks tip alignment by periodically passing the welding tip of a welding torch through a V-shaped notch in a gauging block. The gauging block is electrically conductive and if the tip contacts the sidewalls of the V-shaped notch an electrical circuit is completed signalling the robot controller of tip misalignment. A third device comprises a shielding gas monitor having a closed tube to which the welding torch is applied for expelling shielding gas into the tube. The tube is in fluid communication with a flow gauge that measures gas flow and signals the controller if gas flow is insufficient.
Claims We claim: 1. A torch alignment monitor for a welding robot, the welding robot is provided with a welding wire that projects from the welding robot, the monitor comprising: an alignment gauging block mounted in a fixed location relative to the welding robot, the gauging block is provided with a V-shaped notch having electrically conductive sidewalls, the electrically conductive sidewalls are electrically connected to the welding robot, the welding wire is programmed to pass through the V-shaped notch on a periodic basis and not touch the sidewalls of the alignment gauging block; and means for transmitting a sensing electrical signal through the welding wire as it passes through the V-shaped notch, if the welding wire contacts the electrically conductive sidewalls of the gauging block as it passes through the V-shaped notch a circuit is completed whereby the electrical signal is transmitted to the welding robot indicating the welding wire is misaligned.
