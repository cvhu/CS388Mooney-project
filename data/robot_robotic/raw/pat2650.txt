A robot hand able to change the manner of holding an object while force applied from a plurality of finger mechanisms to the object is adjusted without using an auxiliary finger mechanism. When force F.sub.3 is applied to object w from a certain finger mechanism 13 among the plurality of finger mechanisms 11 to 13 is changed, the operation of each finger mechanism is controlled such that a "contact" of each of the finger mechanisms 11 to 13 in the object w and an "application force vector" from each of the finger mechanisms 11 to 13 to the object w satisfy a "stable gripping condition". The "stable gripping condition" is a condition in which (1) the sum of each of forces and moments applied from the plurality of finger mechanisms 11 to 13 to the object w becomes zero, and (2) a slip index fr becomes minimum.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot hand, comprising: a base portion; a plurality of finger mechanisms extended from the base portion and able to be bent and stretched; a first measuring section for measuring a contact point with each finger mechanism on an object; a second measuring section for measuring a force vector applied from each finger mechanism to the object; and a control section for controlling an operation of each finger mechanism on the basis of a measuring result of each of the first measuring section and the second measuring section; wherein said control section controls the operation of each finger mechanism such that the contact point with each finger mechanism on the object measured by the first measuring section and the force vector applied to the object from each finger mechanism measured by the second measuring section satisfy a stable gripping condition in a process for changing the force vector applied to the object from at least one of certain finger mechanisms among the plurality of finger mechanisms; and said stable gripping condition is a condition in which a sum of each of forces and moments applied from said plurality of finger mechanisms to said object becomes zero, and a slip index becomes minimum as a decreasing function of the magnitude of an inner product of a vector perpendicular to an axis of a frictional cone of said object with respect to each finger mechanism and an application force vector from each finger mechanism to the object becomes minimum. 2. The robot hand according to claim 1, wherein the robot hand further comprises a first finger mechanism, and second and third finger mechanisms abutting on said object oppositely to the first finger mechanism as said plurality of finger mechanisms, contacts on the object of each of the first, second and third finger mechanisms being defined as a first contact, a second contact and a third contact, respectively; and said control section controls the operation of each finger mechanism such that a ratio of the force applied to the object from each of the first, second and third finger mechanisms with respect to a direction perpendicular to a line segment connecting the second and third contacts in a plane including the first, second and third contacts in the process for changing the force vector applied from the third finger mechanism to the object is represented as -1:.alpha.:1-.alpha.(0.ltoreq..alpha.<1) by using a coefficient .alpha. determined so as to satisfy said stable gripping condition. 3. The robot hand according to claim 1, wherein said control section controls the operation of each finger mechanism such that the force applied to said object from at least one finger mechanism except for said certain finger mechanism, in which the force of this certain finger mechanism applied to said object is weakened, among said plurality of finger mechanisms reaches an upper limit value. 4. A legged mobile robot comprising, a base body; a plurality of leg bodies extended from the base body; an arm extended from an upper portion of the base body; a robot hand attached to a tip of the arm; and a control section for controlling a gripping operation of an object using the robot hand and operations of the plurality of leg bodies; said robot hand, comprising: a base portion; a plurality of finger mechanisms extended from the base portion and able to be bent and stretched; a first measuring section for measuring a contact point with each finger mechanism on said object; and a second measuring section for measuring a force vector applied from each finger mechanism to the object; wherein said control section controls the operation of each finger mechanism such that the contact point with each finger mechanism on the object measured by the first measuring section and the force vector applied to the object from each finger mechanism measured by the second measuring section satisfy a stable gripping condition in a process for changing the force vector applied to the object from at least one of certain finger mechanisms among the plurality of finger mechanisms; and said stable gripping condition is a condition in which the sum of each of forces and moments applied from said plurality of finger mechanisms to said object becomes zero, and a slip index becomes minimum as a decreasing function of a magnitude of an inner product of a vector perpendicular to an axis of a frictional cone of said object with respect to each finger mechanism and an application force vector from each finger mechanism to the object.
