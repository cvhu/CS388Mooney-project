The controller according to claim 1, wherein the target arbitrator outputs a reactive controller command for reaching the target based on the prediction by the predicting module or the planning by the planning module supplied from the target arbitrator as motor commands. 6. A robot comprising a controller for controlling a motion of the robot, the controller comprising: a target input interface for supplying the controller with information about a target to be reached, a predicting module predicting, using a computer, at least one future state of the controlled robot using an internal model of the robot, a planning module for planning, using the computer, at least one other future state of the robot, wherein the planning by the planning module starts from the at least one future state predicted by and supplied from the predicting module, a reactive controller for outputting motor commands in order to make the controlled robot reach the target, and a target arbitrator for outputting an actual target signal to the reactive controller, wherein, upon receiving an intermediate target of the at least one future state, the target arbitrator stores the target to be reached and outputs the intermediate target of the at least one future state, wherein the predicting module supplies an intermediate prediction result of the at least one future state to the planning module before a time at which the predicting module finalizes the prediction of the at least one future state and the predicting module triggers the planning module. 7.

The method according to claim 7, wherein planned motion information is computed based on the intermediate prediction result, and said planned motion information is stored in a database, in order to be used upon being triggered. 9. The method according to claim 7, wherein, while the predicting is performed, the intermediate prediction result is used for the planning of the at least one other future state, and subsequently the planning of the at least one other future state is triggered as soon as the predicting of the at least one future state is completed, and wherein planning information is computed based on the intermediate prediction result, and said planning information is stored in a database, in order to be used upon being triggered at the time.
