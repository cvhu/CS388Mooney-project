A system for the semiautomatic inspection of printed circuits on silicon wafers and other similar micro-electronic products which comprises in combination a floating table supporting a robot arm which has the function of grabbing a single wafer from a cassette in which it is housed, inverting same, or assuming a position with its axis defining the Y-axis of the scanning system, and of moving in this direction; and of placing after inspection such wafer in another cassette according to the grade it received; an optical inspection device, such as optical microscope combined with a TV camera or the like attached to said same table, said microscope being adapted to move in the direction of the X-coordinate of the inspection system, there being provided means for aligning the direction of the printed circuit with the X-Y coordinates of the scanning system. A sophisticated optoscanner system is used for the alignment of the wafer and for establishing its exact position. The wafer is held by a vacuum gripper from the moment of its removal from the first cassette and up to its insertion into another one.
Claims We claim: 1. A system for the inspection of printed circuits and other microelectronic elements on wafers of silicon and other semiconductors or suitable substrates comprising in a single transfer mechanism the combination of: a robot arm for holding wafers during the entire inspection sequence and adapted to carry out an angular motion in a given plane, to align itself along a defines axis (the Y axis), to turn about its axis, and to move as required along the Y axis; a vibration isolated table supporting said robot arm and cassettes for storing wafers before and after inspection, said vibration isolated table essentially eliminating vibrations of the wafer during the inspection process; inspection means arranged so as to point upwards for inspection of the wafer which faces downwards as held by the robot arm and for determining alignment and a center of a printed circuit on the wafer prior to start of actual inspection of its printed circuit, the robot arm and the inspection means being mounted on the same vibration isolated table, scanner means using the circumference of the wafer and a flat segment of the wafer for establishing the exact position of the wafer, center of the wafer and center of the printed circuit on the wafer, the robot arm being able to swing about a desired angle in the X--Y plane, to turn about its axis, and to extend or retract about its axis, and an axis of the robot arm defines the Y direction, and the inspection means moves perpendicular to the Y direction (in the X direction). 2. A system according to claim 1, further comprising a plurality of cassettes for housing the wafers, one being the container for wafers prior to inspection, the others being the containers for housing the wafers according to a selection, according to the results of the inspection. 3. A system according to claim 1, wherein said inspection means includes one of an optical microscope, UV microscope, IR microscope, particle beam device, surface scanning device, laser microscope, dark field inspection device, and tunneling microscope.
