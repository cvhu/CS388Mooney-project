An apparatus for gripping parcels which includes a pair of cooperating side clamps connected by a scissors actuator, configured for movement with a suction holding device. A controller and a trigger switch are likewise used to facilitate accurate gripping of parcels thereby.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for gripping parcels, comprising: an apparatus frame; a suction holding device attached to the underneath of said frame and positionable adjacent to an upper surface of a parcel by movement of said frame downwardly from above relative to said parcel; a scissors actuator attached relative to said apparatus frame; and a pair of side clamps connected by said scissors actuator mounted for movement with said suction holding device, said scissors actuator positioning said side clamps on opposite sides of said suction holding device, and being configured to move said side clamps synchronously toward or away from said suction holding device, and being operable to urge said side clamps inwardly against the sides of said parcel to grip said parcel while said parcel is being held by said suction holding device. 2. The gripping apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a contact sensor mounted for movement with said suction holding device, said contact sensor providing a contact signal indicative of said suction holding device being at a first predetermined distance from the upper surface of said parcel; and a controller programmed to operate said suction holding device responsive to said distance signal. 3. The gripping apparatus of claim 2, wherein said controller is configured to indicate a position of said gripping apparatus in a frame of reference; further comprising means for measuring the height of said parcel within said frame of reference; and wherein said controller is configured to: determine a first position in said frame of reference when said suction holding device is at said first predetermined distance from the upper surface of said parcel; lower said gripping apparatus a series of finite predetermined distances towards a series of associated target positions until said contact sensor is triggered within the last of said series of predetermined distances; determine the last target position corresponding to the last predetermined distance; determine the height of a gap between said suction holding device and the upper surface of said parcel by subtracting the difference between said last target position and said first position from said last predetermined distance; determine if said gap is less than a predetermined threshold; lower said suction holding device if said gap is not less than said threshold; and activate said suction holding device to hold said parcel if said gap is less than said threshold. 4. The gripping apparatus of claim 1, wherein said scissors actuator is mounted for vertical movement with respect to said suction holding device; and further comprising means for selectively moving said scissors actuator to a position in which said side clamps are below said suction holding device. 5. The gripping apparatus of claim 1, wherein said side clamps include inwardly facing suction devices. 6. An apparatus for gripping parcels, comprising: a suction holding device positionable adjacent to an upper surface of a parcel; means for measuring the height of said parcel within a frame of reference; a contact sensor mounted for movement with said suction holding device, said contact sensor providing a contact signal indicative of said suction holding device being at a first predetermined distance from the upper surface of said parcel; and a controller configured to: determine a first position within said frame of reference when said suction holding device is at said first predetermined distance from the upper surface of said parcel; lower said gripping apparatus a series of finite predetermined distances towards a series of associated target positions until said contact sensor is triggered within the last of said series of predetermined distances; determine the last target position corresponding to the last predetermined distance; determine the height of a cap between said suction holding device and the upper surface of said parcel by subtracting the difference between said last target position and said first position from said last predetermined distance; determine if said gap is less than a predetermined threshold; lower said suction holding device if said gap is not less than said threshold; and activate said suction holding device to hold said parcel if said gap is less than said threshold. 7. An apparatus for gripping parcels, comprising: a suction holding device positionable adjacent to an upper surface of a parcel; a pair of side clamps connected by a scissors actuator mounted for movement with said suction holding device, said scissors actuator positioning said side clamps on opposite sides of said suction holding device, said scissors actuator being configured to move said side clamps synchronously toward or away from said suction holding device, said scissors actuator being operable to urge said side clamps inwardly against the sides of said parcel to grip said parcel while said parcel is being held by said suction holding device, and said scissors actuator mounted for vertical movement with respect to said suction holding device; and means for selectively moving said scissors actuator to a position in which said side clamps are below said suction holding device. 8. An apparatus for gripping parcels, comprising: a suction holding device positionable adjacent to an upper surface of a parcel; a pair of side clamps connected by a scissors actuator mounted for movement with said suction holding device, said scissors actuator positioning said side clamps on opposite sides of said suction holding device, said scissors actuator being configured to move said side clamps synchronously toward or away from said suction holding device, said scissors actuator being operable to urge said side clamps inwardly against the sides of said parcel to grip said parcel while said parcel is being held by said suction holding device, and said scissors actuator mounted for vertical movement with respect to said suction holding device; and means for selectively moving said scissors actuator between a position in which said side clamps are below said suction holding device to a position in which said side clamps are above said suction holding device.
