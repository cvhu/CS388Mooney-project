In an article transporting system, a first linear moving arm and a second linear moving arm are juxtaposed to each other so as to be moved linearly while keeping a parallel positional relationship with each other. First end portions of the linear moving arms are coupled to an article transporting unit through first and second links. A linear drive mechanism is provided for linearly moving the article transporting unit in a direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the linear moving arms by the linear movement of the first and second linear moving arms. The first and second linear moving arms are synchronously linearly moved in opposite directions to each other. In this case, to avoid an unstable posture of the article transporting unit during the movement, a posture maintaining device is provided between one of the first and second linear moving arms and the article transporting unit. It is possible to save a space for the article transporting work by using the two linear moving arms and the link mechanism.
