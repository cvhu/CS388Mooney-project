In a data storage system with multiple output media types, each request to store a data object is automatically analyzed to select the optimal output media type. In choosing the output media type best suited to quickly and efficiently complete the storage requests, the storage system considers (1) attributes of the data object itself, such as its size, (2) any perceived urgency required to complete the data storage request, and (3) attributes of the system's storage devices, such as the availability of different output media types, presence of other storage requests queued for storage for each type, level of ongoing access of each storage type by concurrent storage tasks, delays to initiate storage such as mount/demount times, amount of storage space available in different output media types, and the like.
