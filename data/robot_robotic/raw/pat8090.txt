We apply manipulation planning to computer animation. A new path planner is presented that automatically computes the collision-free trajectories for several cooperating arms to manipulate a movable object between two configurations. This implemented planner is capable of dealing with complicated tasks where regrasping is involved. We have demonstrated the capability of this planner to generate realistic human arm motions involved in the manipulation of objects.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a data processing system having a display, a method for generating a collision free path for grasping and carrying a movable object from an initial location to a desired goal location on the display for a human or human-like figure having grasps and grasping arms, based on task level commands, which method comprises: (a) specifying a geometric model of the human or human-like figure; (b) specifying a kinematic model of the human or human-like figure including joint constraints; (c) specifying a geometry of an environment in which object manipulation motion is to take place; (d) specifying a desired goal location in the environment of the object to be manipulated; (e) identifying locations within the environment at which the human or human-like figure can grasp the object to be manipulated and identifying and enumerating all sets of grasps and grasping arms which can be achieved without collision; (f) generating a collision-free path for the object to be manipulated and the human or human-like figure to move the object to be manipulated to the desired goal location, using the geometric model of the human or human-like figure, the kinematic model of the human or human-like figure, the geometry of the environment and a search algorithm (1) to generate a set of non-intersecting paths for motion of the human or human-like figure and the object to be manipulated, (2) to identify locations at which the human or human-like figure may grasp objects to be manipulated, and (3) to verify that at each said location the object may be grasped by a permitted grasp; (g) generating movement as a series of configurations of grasps, grasping arms and the object to be manipulated on the display of the human or human-like figure to grasp the object at one of the identified locations; and (h) generating movement as a series of configurations of grasps, grasping arms and the object to be manipulated on the display of the human or human-like figure to move the object to the specified goal location. 2.

The method of claim 2 comprising defining a finite set of grasps, each grasp describing a rigid attachment of at least one end effector of at least one grasping arm with the movable object. 4. The method of claim 2 comprising generating the collision free path, where said collision free path comprises: (a) a series of configurations, each configuration associating a grasp and grasping arm, and (b) a series of subpaths connecting a pair of successive configurations. 5. The method of claim 2 comprising generating and displaying the collision free path for the geometrically and kinematically modelled anthromorphic figure having grasps and grasping arms, to grasp and carry a movable object from an initial location to a desired goal location on a display by implementing a high level command.
