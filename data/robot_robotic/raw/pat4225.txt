The present invention provides design and synthesis of oligomeric compounds and compositions that can be administered to reduce the activity of SARS virus in vivo or in vitro, to prevent or treat SARS virus-associated disease, to detect AARS virus, and to diagnose SARS virus-associated diseases.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonucleotide 12 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 2 to 73 of a nucleic acid molecule encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (SEQ ID NO: 29752), wherein said oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes with the nucleic acid molecule encoding SARS virus. 2. The oligonucleotide of claim 1 which is 15 to 30 nucleobases in length. 3. The oligonucleotide of claim 1 which is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 4. The oligonucleotide of claim 1 comprising at least one modified intemucleoside linkage, modified sugar moiety, or modified nucleobase. 5. The oligonucleotide of claim 4 comprising at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 6. The oligonucleotide of claim 4 comprising at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 7. The oligonucleotide of claim 4 comprising at least one 5-methylcytosine. 8. The oligonucleotide of claim 1 which is single-stranded. 9. The oligonucleotide of claim 1 targeted to nucleobases 2 to 71 of said nucleic acid molecule encoding SARS virus (SEQ ID NO: 29752). 10. The oligonucleotide of claim 9, comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 22, 23, 24 or 54. 11. The oligonucleotide of claim 10, wherein the nucleotide sequence consists of SEQ ID NO: 24. 12. The oligonucleotide of claim 5, comprising a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety at each nucleotide. 13. The oligonucleotide of claim 4, comprising at least one locked nucleic acid. 14. The oligonucleotide of claim 13, comprising a locked nucleic acid at each nucleotide. 15. The oligonucleotide of claim 4, comprising at least one peptide nucleic acid. 16. The oligonucleotide of claim 15, comprising a peptide nucleic acid at each nucleotide. 17. The oligonucleotide of claim 4, comprising at least one morpholino modification. 18. The oligonucleotide of claim 17, comprising a morpholino modification at each position.
