A system (100) is provided for storing knowledge, information and data (KID). The system includes a plurality of sources of KID (20), at least one receiver of KID (30) from the plurality of sources, a universal knowledge, information and data store (UKIDS 160) and an interface (150) coupling the receiver and the UKIDS. The interface provides a plurality of logical partitions (200) for storing KID within the UKIDS.
