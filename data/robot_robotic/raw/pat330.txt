An automated analyzer for performing multiple diagnostic assays simultaneously includes multiple stations in which discrete aspects of the assay are performed on fluid samples contained in sample vessels. The analyzer includes stations for automatically preparing a sample, incubating the sample, preforming an analyte isolation procedure, ascertaining the presence of a target analyte, and analyzing the amount of a target analyte. An automated receptacle transporting system moves the sample vessels from one station to the next. A method for performing an automated diagnostic assay includes an automated process for isolating and amplifying a target analyte, and, in one embodiment, a method for real-time monitoring of the amplification process.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An automated method for processing the contents of multiple reaction receptacles to determine the presence or amount of a target nucleic acid in each of the reaction receptacles, the method comprising the steps of: a) isolating and purifying target nucleic acid that may be present in a sample material contained within each of the reaction receptacles by: i) exposing each reaction receptacle to a magnetic field, thereby isolating magnetically responsive solid supports within each reaction receptacle, the solid supports being capable of directly or indirectly immobilizing the target nucleic acid thereon; ii) during step i), removing at least a portion of the sample material in each reaction receptacle from the isolated solid supports; and iii) after step ii), removing the magnetic field and washing the solid supports in each reaction receptacle with a wash solution; b) moving the reaction receptacles to a temperature-controlled chamber of an incubator, each reaction receptacle being provided with reagents sufficient to amplify and detect the presence of a target sequence contained within the target nucleic acid under the temperature conditions of the incubator, and effecting amplification of the target nucleic acid; c) exposing each reaction receptacle to a magnetic field within the incubator, thereby aggregating at least a portion of the solid supports within each reaction receptacle, wherein the incubator includes a reaction receptacle carrier that is rotatable about an axis of rotation and is configured to receive and hold reaction receptacles moved to the incubator, and wherein the receptacle carrier comprises: i) a plurality of receptacle carrier stations, each station being configured to receive and hold at least one reaction receptacle; and ii) a magnetic divider disposed between each of a pair of adjacent carrier stations and including one or more magnets configured to expose each reaction receptacle carried in one of the pair of adjacent carrier stations to a magnetic field in accordance with step c); and d) during step c), measuring the amount of a signal associated with an amplification product free in solution containing the target sequence or its complement in each reaction receptacle provided to the incubator in accordance with step b). 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the carrier comprises a circular carousel that is oriented horizontally and is rotatable about a vertical axis of rotation with the receptacle carrier stations arranged around the circumference of the carrousel, and wherein the magnetic dividers are angularly spaced about the axis of rotation. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein each magnetic divider comprises a divider wall that is oriented radially with respect to the axis of rotation. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein each magnet comprises neodymium-iron-boron.
