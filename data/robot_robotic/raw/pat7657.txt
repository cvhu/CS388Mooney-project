A graphical user interface for monitoring or controlling a process having a plurality of components. Graphical objects are operatively connected to one another such that movement of a representation of one of the graphical objects correspondingly affects the movement of a representation of the other graphical object. The graphical objects are associated with the plurality of components through data linking. Data received from the process relates to position or state changes of the components. Properties of the graphical objects are updated with the received data causing the representations of the graphical objects to move accordingly.
