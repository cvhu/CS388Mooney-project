A stable platform supports a cell, the stable platform comprises a lower mainframe, an upper mainframe, and a dampener system. The upper mainframe includes a plurality of recesses. Each recess is configured to receive a cell. The dampener system connects the lower mainframe to the upper mainframe. In one embodiment, the dampener system comprises a dampener element, such as sand, to dampen vibrations between the lower mainframe and the lower mainframe.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A platform to support a cell, comprising: a lower mainframe; an upper mainframe including a plurality of recesses, each one of the plurality of recesses configured to receive a cell, wherein the upper mainframe comprises a fastener structure positioned proximate each one of the recesses, wherein the fastener structure is configured to hold the cell; and a dampener system connecting the lower mainframe to the upper mainframe, wherein the dampener system comprises a plurality of support members that extend between the lower mainframe and the upper mainframe, wherein each support member composes: a hollow tubular member, a piston slidably disposed within the hollow tubular member, and a dampening element contained within the hollow tubular member, wherein the piston is biased against the dampening element. 2. A platform to support a cell, comprising: a lower mainframe; an upper mainframe including a plurality of recesses, each one of the plurality of recesses configured to receive a cell, wherein the upper mainframe comprises a rigidifying plate and a main base plate comprising the plurality of recesses, the rigidifying plate comprising at least one aperture and attached to the main base plate such that the at least one aperture is aligned with the recesses; and a dampener system connecting the lower mainframe to the upper mainframe, wherein the dampener system comprises a plurality of support member that extend between the lower mainframe and the upper mainframe, wherein each support member comprises: a hollow tubular member, a piston slidably disposed within the hollow tubular member, and a dampening element contained within the hollow tubular member, wherein the piston is based against the dampening element.
