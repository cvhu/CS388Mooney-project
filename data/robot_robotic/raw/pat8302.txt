An automotive paint booth containing multiple contiguous chambers can be supplied with down flowing air streams in the various chambers for removing airborne particulates produced by the painting operations. Cross flow of particulates between contiguous chambers can be controlled by slightly varying the down flow velocities in the respective chambers.
Claims What is claimed: 1. An automotive body paint booth comprising multiple connected contiguous treatment chambers adapted to have automotive bodies pass sequentially there through in repetitive fashion; means for moving air downwardly through selected ones of said chambers for removing contaminants from said chambers; and means for controlling cross flow of air between said chambers; said cross flow control means comprising means for measuring the cross flow between adjacent chambers and means for measuring the down flow within individual chambers. 2. The paint booth of claim 1, wherein said contiguous chambers are separated by vertical partitions; each said vertical partition having a relatively large opening adapted to pass an automotive body and a relatively small pilot opening adapted to pass air between contiguous chambers; said cross flow control means comprising a two axis ultrasonic anemometer located at each said partition proximate to the associated pilot opening; each anemometer having a first emitter-receiver combination oriented to measure cross flow through the respective pilot opening, and a second emitter-receiver combination oriented to measure down flow along the associated partition. 3. An automotive body paint booth comprising multiple connected contiguous treatment chambers adapted to have automotive bodies pass sequentially there through in repetitive fashion; means for moving air downwardly through selected ones of said chambers for removing contaminants from said chambers; and means for controlling cross flow of air between said chambers; said cross flow control means comprising a two axis ultrasonic anemometer having a first emitter-receiver combination oriented to measure cross flow between adjacent chambers, and a second emitter-receiver combination oriented to measure down flow within an individual chamber. 4. An automotive body paint booth comprising multiple connected contiguous treatment chambers adapted to have automotive bodies pass sequentially there through in repetitive fashion; means for moving air downwardly through selected ones of said chambers for removing contaminants from said chambers; and means for controlling cross flow of air between said chambers; said cross flow control means comprising multiple anemometers located between contiguous chambers; each anemometer comprising an ultrasonic anemometer having a first emitter-receiver combination oriented to measure cross flow between contiguous chambers, and a second emitter-receiver combination oriented to measure down flow within an individual chamber.
