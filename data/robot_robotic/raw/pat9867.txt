A closed loop control system for a pneumatic actuator using position and pressure feedback signals. The feedback signals are supplied to a microprocessor which successively generates a desired acceleration, a desired actuator force, a desired gas pressure, and a gas mass flow rate command for a gas flow controlling valve. The use of the gas flow rate as a control variable decouples pneumatic ronlinearities from the control loop. Nonlinear viscous friction, coulomb friction and load effects are decoupled from the control loop prior to the calculation of the desired pressure. An improved trajectory is achieved by employing a plurality of trajectory phases, including a velocity control phase.
