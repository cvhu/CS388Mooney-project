A method includes installing a device under test (DUT) into each of a plurality of burn-in boards. The method further includes docking each of the burn-in boards to a respective docking location, each of the burn-in boards with a single respective DUT installed therein. The method further includes subjecting the DUTs to a self-heating burn-in procedure while the burn-in boards are docked to the docking locations. Other embodiments are described and claimed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method comprising: applying a burn-in procedure to a device under test (DUT) at a burn-in station; sensing with a thermal sensing circuit included in the DUT an internal temperature of the DUT; the thermal sensing circuit included in the DUT comparing the sensed temperature with a programmed burn-in temperature; the thermal sensing circuit included in the DUT generating a signal that indicates the internal temperature of the DUT exceeds a target temperature; receiving in a driver circuit the signal generated by the thermal sensing circuit in the DUT; and controlling a cooling device at the burn-in station in response to said signal generated by the thermal sensing circuit in the DUT. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the cooling device is a fan. 3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: transmitting a control signal from the driver circuit to the fan. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the burn-in procedure is a self-heating burn-in procedure. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the burn-in station is a docking location that includes a connector adapted to be coupled to an edge connector of a burn-in board in which the DUT is installed.
