A method for transferring a pattern from an elastic stamp to a substrate in the presence of a third medium is described. A proximity contact is achieved between the stamp and the substrate. A layer of the third medium between the stamp and the substrate is controlled to a predetermined thickness. Stamps for carrying out this method are also described.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method, comprising: transferring a pattern from an elastic stamp to a substrate in the presence of a medium; wherein the transferring comprises bringing the stamp into contact with the substrate while controlling a layer of the medium between the stamp and the substrate to a predetermined thickness, and guiding excess medium away from the surface of the stamp, wherein the controlling comprises providing a plurality of first protrusions in the stamp separated from one another by first drainage channels; each first protrusion further being subdivided into a plurality of smaller second protrusions separated from one another by smaller second drainage channels, with both the first and second drainage channels configured to guide excess portions of the medium away from a contact surface of the stamp; and wherein the plurality of smaller protrusions are arranged in a hexagonal packing arrangement. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the second drainage channels form an open linked network. 3. A method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of smaller protrusions have a circular cross section.
