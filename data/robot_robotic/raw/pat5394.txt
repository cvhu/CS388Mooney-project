Disclosed herein is a laser welding system having a travel path to carry a first blank and a second blank. An upstream clamp assembly and a downstream clamp assembly are positioned on the travel path and each of the upstream and downstream clamp assemblies are movable to an open position to allow the first blank to pass through the upstream clamp assembly to a first location within the downstream clamp assembly. A laser welding source is directed at a weld location on the travel path between the upstream and downstream clamp assemblies. At least one locating means is operable to locate the first weld edge adjacent the weld location. A first displacement means displaces the first weld edge against the locating means. The downstream clamp assembly is movable from the open position to a closed clamped position to clamp the first blank with the first weld edge adjacent the weld location. The locating means is operable to be withdrawn from the travel path. The upstream clamp assembly is movable from the open position to an intermediate position, which is selected to guide the second blank to pass through the upstream clamp assembly in a substantially coplanar relationship with the first blank so that the second weld edge makes contact with, but not past, the first weld edge. A second displacement means displaces the second blank to a location adjacent the weld location where the second weld edge abuts the first weld edge. The upstream clamp assembly is movable from the intermediate position to a closed clamped position to clamp the second blank and the--the laser welding source is operable to fuse the first and second weld edges blanks together.

A conveyor system as defined in claim 1 wherein each of the lateral positioning arms includes an upwardly directed frame member and a plurality of stop members mounted on the frame member, the stop members being arranged to engage a corresponding side edge of the blank. 3. A conveyor system as defined in claim 2 wherein the magnetic conveyor has a travel path, each longitudinal positioning assembly further comprising a carriage mounted for travel along the travel path, one or more setting pins, and one or more drive units for driving the setting pins between an operative position interrupting the travel path and an inoperable position below the travel path. 4. A conveyor system as defined in claim 3 wherein the setting pins are located at a position in the travel path to engage the trailing edge of the blank. 5. Apparatus for delivering, successively, two groups of blanks of different dimensions along a travel path to a downstream processing station and for orienting each blank to arrive at the station in a precisely controlled orientation, each group of blanks having two sets of common blanks, comprising: a conveyor arrangement to convey the blanks along a travel path; means for providing a first group of blanks, the first group including a first set of blanks and a second set of blanks for producing a first article; a first pair of lateral positioning arms on opposite sides of the travel path at a first location; means for incrementally controlling the position of each first lateral positioning arm by a first servo positioner; a second pair of lateral positioning arms on opposite sides of the travel path at a second location; means for incrementally controlling the position of each of the second lateral positioning arms by a second servo positioner; means for processing the blanks of the first group by presetting the parameters of the first and second servo positioners to define an inoperative position and an operative position for each corresponding lateral positioning wherein, in the operative position, the arms engage opposing side edge of a corresponding blank to locate the corresponding blank of the first group in a precisely controlled orientation; means for actuating the first servo positioners to shuttle the first lateral positioning arms between the inoperative and operative positions to process, successively, the blanks of the first set; means for delivering, successively, each blank of the first set to the first location on the travel path; means for actuating the second servo positioners to shuttle the second lateral positioning arms between the inoperative and operative positions to process, successively, the blanks of the second set; means for delivering, successively, each blank of the second set to the second location on the travel path; means for processing a second group of blanks, the second group including a third set of blanks and a fourth set of blanks for producing a second article; means for processing the blanks of the second group by presetting the parameters of the first and second servo positioners to define an inoperative position and an operative position for each corresponding lateral positioning arm wherein, in the operative position, the arms engage opposing side edge of a corresponding blank to locate the corresponding blank of the second group in a precisely controlled orientation; means for actuating the first servo positioners to shuttle the first lateral positioning arms between the inoperative and operative positions to process, successively, the blanks of the third set; means for delivering, successively, each blank of a third set to the first location on the travel path; means for actuating the second servo positioners to shuttle the second lateral positioning arms between the inoperative and operative positions to process, successively, the blanks of the fourth set; and means for delivering, successively, each blank of the second set to the second location on the travel path.
