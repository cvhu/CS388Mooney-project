An orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus is adapted for use in combination with a robot to form a dispensing system. The orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus has a dispensing tube with a first end for receiving the materials to be dispersed and a second or nozzle end from which the material is finally dispersed onto the workpiece. The dispensing tube is compliantly supported at one end and supported at the nozzle end for orbital but not rotational motion about an axis.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus for the application of adhesives or sealants to a substrate comprising: dispensing tube means having a first end for receiving materials to be dispersed thereinto and a second, nozzle end from which the material is dispersed; drive means housing having a lower end and an upper end; support means extending from the lower end of said drive means housing and in which said dispensing tube means is disposed; a first mounting means at the upper end of said drive means housing means for compliantly supporting said dispensing tube means for non-rotational movement at a location proximate said first end thereof, said first mounting means facilitating orbital movement of said second end of said dispensing tube means; a second mounting means for supporting said dispensing tube means at a location proximate said second, nozzle end within said support means, said second mounting means being mounted in said support means for rotational movement about a first axis and having a bore therethrough which is offset with respect to said first axis, said second mounting means supporting said dispensing tube at a location proximate said second, nozzle end within said bore by bearing means for orbital movement about said first axes; and motive means mounted in said drive means housing operatively associated with said second mounting means for affecting the rotational movement of said second mounting means, said motive means including a motor having a hollow rotor drive shaft which has a bottom portion extending from the motor and through which the dispensing tube means depends and wherein the second mounting means is fixedly mounted in the bottom of the extending portion, whereby rotational movement about the first axis is imparted to the second mounting means by rotation of the rotor drive shaft such that the rotational movement of said second mounting means imparts orbital movement to said second, nozzle end of the dispensing tube means about the first axis. 2. The orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the first mounting means consists of neoprene. 3. The orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the motive means is a synchronous motor. 4. The orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus according to claim 1 including a sized output nozzle having a bore of a predetermined diameter therein removably disposed in the second end of the dispensing tube means. 5. In combination with a robot having at least an arm adapted to receive an end effector or the like thereon, an orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus for the application of adhesives or sealants to a substrate, operably associated with the arm of said robot, said orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus comprising: dispensing tube means having a first end for receiving materials to be dispersed thereinto and a second, nozzle end from which the material is dispersed; drive means housing having a lower end and an upper end; support means extending from the lower end of said drive means housing and in which said dispensing tube means is disposed; a first mounting means at the upper end of said drive means housing means for compliantly supporting said dispensing tube means for non-rotational movement at a location proximate said first end thereof, said first mounting means facilitating orbital movement of said second end of said dispensing tube means; a second mounting means for supporting said dispensing tube means at a location proximate said second, nozzle end within said support means, said second mounting means being mounted in said support means for rotational movement about a first axis and having a bore therethrough which is offset with respect to said first axis, said second mounting means supporting said dispensing tube at a location proximate said second, nozzle end within said bore by bearing means for orbital movement about said first axes; and motive means mounted in said drive means housing operatively associated with said second mounting means for affecting the rotational movement of said second mounting means, said motive means including a motor having a hollow rotor drive shaft which has a bottom portion extending from the motor and through which the dispensing tube means depends and wherein the second mounting means is fixedly mounted in the bottom of the extending portion, whereby rotational movement about the first axis is imparted to the second mounting means by rotation of the rotor drive shaft such that the rotational movement of said second mounting means imparts orbital movement to said second, nozzle end of the dispensing tube means about the first axis. 6. The combination according to claim 5 wherein the first mounting means consists of neoprene. 7. The combination according to claim 5 wherein the motive means is a synchronous motor. 8. The combination according to claim 5 including a robot control means in communication with the robot to effect the desired movement of the robot; and a material supply means including pump and material flow control means in communication with the orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus for the delivery of material thereto. 9. A material dispensing system for the application of adhesives or sealants to a substrate comprising in combination: a robot having an arm adapted to receive an end effector on the end thereof; robot control means in communication with said robot for affecting the desired movement thereof; and a material supply means including pump and material flow control means for the delivery of material to a material dispersion apparatus, which material dispersion apparatus is an orbiting nozzle dispersion apparatus comprising: dispensing tube means having a first end for receiving materials to be dispersed thereinto and a second, nozzle end from which the material is dispersed; drive means housing having a lower end and an upper end; support means extending from the lower end of said drive means housing and in which said dispensing tube means is disposed; a first mounting means at the upper end of said drive means housing means for compliantly supporting said dispensing tube means for non-rotational movement at a location proximate said first end thereof, said first mounting means facilitating orbital movement of said second end of said dispensing tube means; a second mounting means for supporting said dispensing tube means at a location proximate said second, nozzle end within said support means, said second mounting mmeans being mounted in said support means for rotational movement about a first axis and having a bore therethrough which is offset with respect to said first axis, said second mounting means supporting said dispensing tube at a location proximate said second, nozzle end within said bore by bearing means for orbital movement about said first axes; and motive means mounted in said drive means housing operatively associated with said second mounting means for affecting the rotational movement of said second mounting means, said motive means including a motor having a hollow rotor drive shaft which has a bottom portion extending from the motor and through which the dispensing tube means depends and wherein the second mounting means is fixedly mounted in the bottom of the extending portion, whereby rotational movement about the first axis is imparted to the second mounting menas by rotation of the rotor drive shaft such that the rotational movement of said second mounting means imparts orbital movement to said second, nozzle end of the dispensing tube means about the first axis.
