The system (50) includes at least one tread (52) secured to a tread drive means (54) for moving the tread (52) in a direction of a tread work-axis of motion (58) adjacent an object (78) to be moved. A head (57) is secured to the tread (52), and the head (57) includes a device (66) for grabbing the object (78). The head (57) selectively moves in at least a direction opposed to the tread work-axis of motion (58) and at a rate of speed at least the same as the rate of speed the drive means (54) moves the tread (52) in the tread work-axis of motion (58) direction to thereby achieve a net-zero motion relative to the object (58) to facilitate picking and placing the object (58). A plurality of treads (52) with such heads (57) may be secured in an endless loop (56).
