An improved robot arrangement for performing predetermined tasks, such as paint finishing, features equipping a robot with a plurality of manipulatable arms, with at least two of the arms performing like operations. Alternatively, a plurality of commonly controlled manipulator arms may be provided by clustering a plurality of conventional single arm robots on a common mounting stand.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a robotic system for performing predetermined operations under direction of a controller, the improvement comprising: clustering a plurality of single manipulator arm robots such that a separation distance between attachment points of robot arms of any two of the robots is less than twice a length of a longest arm segment in the cluster. 2. The improvement of claim 1 further comprising: at least two of the plurality of arms performing like operations and at least two of the plurality of arms having different lengths. 3. The improvement of claim 2 wherein the like operations comprise paint application. 4. The improvement of claim 2 wherein each of the plurality of arms are positioned in a common plane. 5. The improvement of claim 4 wherein the common plane is a vertical plane.
