A fluid activated valving apparatus for controlling a very high pressure liquid being adapted for serving as a focused jet liquid stream for use in cutting materials comprising an axially-aligned spindle located sealingly in a liquid delivery conduit adapted to introduce the high pressure liquid into a chamber. One or more bearings are disposed slidably about the free end of a spindle enclosed within the valve body, adapted for sealing engagement, and also to permit unstressed rotation of the spindle through a 360.degree. arc about the spindle longitudinal axis in response to torsional stresses being intermittently exerted on the exposed free end of the spindle.
Claims Having described the invention, what is claimed is: 1. A swivel valve for fluid jet cutting comprising: a fluid flow switch; a piston reciprocally movable in response to the switch and mounted to a valve body; an axially-moveable valve stem means pinned to said piston at one longitudinal end for acting in concert therewith; first conduit means for receiving a stream of a high-pressure liquid; an expansion chamber disposed in a liquid transfer relationship with said conduit means located within said valve body; an apertured valve seat located at one end of the expansion chamber; the valve stem being functionally oriented in said expansion chamber and having on its other longitudinal end a tip surface adapted to effect an interruptible sealing engagement with the valve seat; seal means disposed between a shaft portion of the valve stem and said chamber to preclude commingling of fluid and high pressure liquid; second conduit means for liquid outflow connected to said expansion chamber and providing the valve seat for engaging a free end tip of said valve stem when said piston is actuated in said sealing direction; an expansion section in said second conduit means for developing a laminar flow of said high pressure liquid; nozzle means on a distal end of said second conduit means for shaping the flow pattern of the liquid cutting jet stream upon release from the assembly, wherein the nozzle means is modified to receive a fluid injection means for introduction of a particulate abrasive material into the liquid cutting jet stream before emerging from said assembly; and spindle means associated with the first conduit means adaptable mounted within the valve body to be rotatable through a 360.degree. degree arc, whereby unstressed permitted movements of the spindle means are possible. 2. The valve of claim 1 wherein the valve containing the expansion chamber and the first and second conduits is secured upon and made movable by a robot arm, adapted to traverse in both linear and curvilinear directions, said first conduit means including an axially-aligned spindle located sealing therein, and with the free end of the spindle means being adapted to permit its unstressed rotation in response to torsional stresses being intermittently exerted upon it by a linked external liquid feed conduit means. 3. The valve of claim 1 wherein the valve body and first and second conduits are secured directly to a robot arm, being moveable therewith in the X and Y dimensions of the plane of said arm, and said body concurrently having an axially aligned spindle means located sealingly in the first conduit, which spindle is externally and operationally connected to a feed liquid supply conduit means and is adapted to undergo unstressed rotation in response to torsional forces being exerted upon the axis of said spindle by said feed liquid supply conduit. 4. In a fluid activated valving apparatus for controlling a very high pressure liquid being adapted for serving as a focused liquid cutting jet stream assembly including hydraulic switching means, a piston responsive to the switching means, a valving stem pinned to the piston, an expansion chamber associated with the stem, a liquid conduit delivery means for receiving a high pressure liquid stream and directing same to the chamber, a valved liquid outlet means disposed spaced apart in the expansion chamber cooperating with the stem to valve high pressure liquid outflow from the chamber, a nozzle means at a distal end of the liquid outflow means for forming a focused liquid jet stream for use as a cutting means, all located within or connected to a valve body, the improvement comprising: an axially-aligned spindle means located sealingly in the liquid conduit delivery means of the valve body for introducing the high pressure liquid into the chamber, and a bearing means disposed slidably about the free end of the spindle means enclosed within the valve body for making sealing engagement therewith, but also permitting unstressed rotation of the spindle means in response to torsional stresses being intermittently exerted on said exposed free end of the spindle means, wherein the nozzle means is modified to receive a fluid injection means for introduction of a particulate abrasive material into the cutting stream before emerging from said assembly. 5. The valve of claim 4 wherein the valve body is secured upon and made movable by a robot arm, adapted to traverse in both linearly and curvilinear directions, said liquid conduit delivery means including an axially-aligned spindle located sealingly therein, and with the free end of the spindle means being adapted to permit its unstressed rotation in response to torsional stresses being intermittently exerted upon it by a linked external liquid free conduit means. 6. The valve of claim 4 wherein the valve body is secured directly to a robot arm, being movable therewith in either of the X and Y dimensions of the plane of said arm, and said body concurrently having an axially aligned spindle means located sealingly in the liquid conduit delivery means of the valve body, which spindle is externally and operationally connected to a feed liquid supply conduit means and is adapted to undergo unstressed rotation in response to torsional forces being exerted upon the axis of said spindle by said feed liquid supply conduit.
