An electrical switch apparatus including a movement sensitive form is disclosed. The apparatus includes a housing, a motion sensor and a processing unit, where motion on, near or about the motion sensor is translated into output commands adapted for list scrolling, where the list can be arranged in a hierarchy such as menus or for changing a value of an attribute of a electrical device under the control of the switch.

The apparatus of claim 2, wherein each electrical device or electronic device is a sound system, a display system, an alarm system, a control system, a medical device, a robot, a robotic control systems, a hot and cold water supply devices, an air conditioning system, a heating system, a ventilation system, an air handling system, a lighting device, a camera, an oven, a dishwasher, a stove, a computer, a computer system, or a chemical plant control system. 5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein if the selected system has a single adjustable attribute, then the second output results in changing the value of the single adjustable attribute. 6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the motion sensor is a digital camera, optical scanner, optical roller ball device, touch pad, inductive pad, capacitve pad, holographic device, laser tracking device, or thermal device. 7. A method comprising the steps of providing: a user interface for displaying information to a user, a motion sensor for sensing motion on, near, and/or about the motion sensor and producing an output signal, a processing unit for receiving output signals from the motion sensor and converting the output signal into a command function, where the command function is a scroll function or a simultaneous select and activate function, and one system or a plurality systems in electronic communication with the processing unit and controllable by the processing unit, where one system or a plurality of systems includes a plurality of controllable attributes and where the processing unit includes a system list having a system identifier for each system and system specific attribute lists, each attribute list having an attribute identifier sensing motion on, near, and/or about the motion sensor; producing a first output signal, corresponding to motion in a first direction; causing the processing unit to issue a scroll function for scrolling through the system list, if there is a plurality of systems or scrolling through a system specific attribute list if there is a single system, where the first direction has a positive component and a negative component; sensing motion on, near, and/or about the motion sensor; if the sensed motion is in a direction sufficiently different from the first direction to allow direction discrimination by the processing unit or the motion sensor, producing a second output signal corresponding to a second direction; causing the processing unit to issue a select and activate function to simultaneously select a member from either the system list or the system specific attribute list and activate the selected member; if the selected member is a system specific attribute list, then the processing unit scrolls through the system specific attribute list and until motion in a third direction sufficiently different from the second direction to allow direction discrimination by the processing unit or the motion sensor, producing a third output signal, causing the processing unit to issue a select and activate function to simultaneously select a member from the system specific attribute list and activate the selected member and changes a value of the attribute depending on whether the motion in the third direction increases or decreases the attribute value, and if the selected member is a system specific attribute, then the processing unit changes a value of the attribute depending on whether the motion in the second direction increases or decreases the attribute value. 8.
