Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of G-alpha-i2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding G-alpha-i2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of G-alpha-i2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of G-alpha-i2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonucleotide up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human G-alpha-i2 comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 8, 12, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 36, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 11, 27, 28, 37 or 42 and which inhibits expression of human G-alpha-i2. 2. An antisense oligonucleotide targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human G-alpha-i2 consisting of SEQ ID NO: 13 or 26, wherein said antisense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human G-alpha-i2. 3. The antisense compound of claim 1 or 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 1 or 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 1 or 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 or 2 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of G-alpha-i2 in human cells or tissues in water comprising contacting said cells or tissues in water with the antisense compound of claim 1 or 2 so that expression of G-alpha-i2 is inhibited.
