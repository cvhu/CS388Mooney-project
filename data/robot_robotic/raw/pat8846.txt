A data processing device includes a circuit having status conditions wherein a particular set of the status conditions can occur in operation of the circuit. An instruction register operates to hold a branch instruction conditional on a particular set of the status conditions. A decoder is connected to the instruction register and the circuit. A program counter is coupled to the decoder wherein the decoder is operable to enter a branch address into the program counter in response to the branch instruction when the particular set of the status conditions of the circuit are present.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for pipelined data processing within a data processing device or system including at least one conditional instruction, comprising: fetching a conditional instruction from a first address in a memory which is associated with the data processing device; fetching a conditioned instruction from a second address in the memory while the conditional instruction is being processed within an instruction pipeline of the data processing device; fetching a third instruction from a third address in the memory while the conditional instruction and the conditioned instruction are being processed within the instruction pipeline; wherein the first address, the second address and the third address are sequential addresses within the memory; executing the conditional instruction by determining if a condition specified by the conditional instruction is true; executing the conditioned instruction without regard to the conditional instruction if the condition is a first value and ignoring any result of the conditioned instruction if the condition is a second value; and executing the third instruction without regard to the step of executing the conditional instruction, such that sequential instruction processing proceeds and the conditioned instruction is conditionally executed without flushing the instruction pipeline. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein: the step of executing the conditional instruction further comprises decoding a value that specifies that the third instruction is also a conditional instruction; and the step of executing the third instruction further comprises executing the third instruction without regard to the conditional instruction if the condition is the first value and ignoring any result of the third instruction if the condition is the second value. 3. A method for pipelined data processing within a data processing device or system including at least one conditional instruction, comprising: fetching a plurality of instructions, including a conditional instruction, at least one conditioned instruction, and at least one non-conditioned instruction from a memory which is associated with the data processing device; sequentially processing the plurality of instructions in a pipelined manner by sequentially transferring each instruction through a plurality of pipeline stages, such that the non-conditioned instruction is processed sequentially after the conditioned instruction; decoding a status condition in response to the conditional instruction; storing a first result produced by a first conditioned instruction if the status condition has a first value and ignoring the first result produced by the first conditioned instruction if the status condition has a second value. 4. The method of claim 3, further comprising storing a second result produced by a second conditioned instruction if the status condition has the first value and ignoring the second result produced by the second conditioned instruction if the status condition has the second value.
