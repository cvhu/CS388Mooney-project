The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human bc1-6 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human bc1-6 is inhibited. 14. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, 82, 83, 85 or 88 which inhibits the expression of human bc1-6. 15. The antisense compound of claim 14 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 16. The antisense compound of claim 14 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 17. The antisense compound of claim 16 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 18. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 19. The antisense compound of claim 18, wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 20. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 21. The antisense compound of claim 20 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 22. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 23. A method of inhibiting the expression of human bc1-6 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 14 so that expression of human bc1-6 is inhibited.
