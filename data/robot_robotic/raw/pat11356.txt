Method and apparatus for assembling a spline-type connection wherein a plurality of angularly spaced spline teeth on a first member project radially from a circular edge thereof and are disposed in an imaginary annulus concentric with the circular edge, a staging annulus corresponding in size to the imaginary annulus is formed on a second member at one end of and perpendicular to a cylindrical wall on the second member adapted to slidably receive the circular edge of the first member, a frusto-conical centering guide shoulder is formed on the second member around the staging annulus and extends longitudinally outboard from the staging annulus, and a plurality of spline grooves are formed in the cylindrical wall and intersect the staging annulus at a corresponding plurality of notches angularly spaced to register with the spline teeth. During assembly, the first member is advanced to a staged position on the second member wherein the spline teeth rest on the staging annulus and is then rotated in the staged position to register the spline teeth with the notches to permit advancement of the spline teeth along the spline grooves.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method of assembling a spline connection between a first member and a second member comprising the steps of, forming on said first member a circular edge having a first diameter, forming on said first member at least two angularly spaced spline teeth projecting from said circular edge to a concentric imaginary circle having a second diameter so that each of said spline teeth is disposed in an imaginary annulus between said first and said second diameters, forming on said second member a cylindrical wall aligned on and parallel to an axis of said second member having a diameter generally equal to said first diameter, forming on said second member at an end of said cylindrical wall and in a plane perpendicular to said axis a staging annulus corresponding in size to said imaginary annulus with a first edge thereof coincident with an edge of said cylindrical wall, forming on said second member a centering guide shoulder extending longitudinally outboard from the plane of said staging annulus having one edge coincident with a second edge of said staging annulus, forming at least two spline grooves in said cylindrical wall intersecting said staging annulus at a corresponding number of notches angularly spaced to register with said spline teeth, advancing said first member to a staged position on said second member wherein said spline teeth abut said staging annulus and during which advancement one of said first and said second members forms a reaction member whereby said centering guide shoulder effects relative translation perpendicular to said axis between said first and said second members to establish concentricity between said circular edge on said first member and said cylindrical wall on said second member in said staged position, rotating said first member in said staged position to register each of said spline teeth with a corresponding one of said notches, and advancing said first member along said axis relative to said second member. 2.
