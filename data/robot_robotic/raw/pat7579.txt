A central system controller located at a remote service facility performs the centralized processing of the various refueling transaction requests originating from a network of service station sites. The transaction request is transmitted by the customer from a vehicle RF transceiver to a dispenser-equipped RF transceiver where it is routed through an on-site dedicated controller to the central system controller over a long-haul communications link. The central system controller processes the transaction and directs the dedicated controller to render operative control of the fuel dispenser and an associated hydraulic arm assembly that selectively maneuvers the nozzle assembly into fueling engagement with the vehicle in an automated fashion. The central system controller is connected to other commercial retailers such as online merchants to permit the customer to request additional transactions unrelated to the refueling activity. Video linkage between the system controller and other commercial retailers is also possible.
