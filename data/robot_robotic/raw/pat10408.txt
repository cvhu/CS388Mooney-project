Joining of thermoplastic parts (2, 4) of indeterminate thickness to each other is effected by application of heat to selected surface areas thereof (42, 44) by intense focussed infrared heat lines produced by parabolic-elliptical-reflection heat sources (22, 24) displaced by a reciprocating linear actuator (26), removable by a robotic controller (36) after completion of heating to enable immediate pushing together of the parts by further actuators (32, 34) for bonding.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for bonding two thermoplastic objects comprising: first means for carrying a first thermoplastic object to be bonded along a predetermined first bonding area; second means for carrying a second thermoplastic object to be bonded to such first thermoplastic object along a predetermined second bonding area; heating means for producing a first focused beam of infrared heat impinging upon such first object within substantially only such first bonding area and for producing a second focused beam of infrared heat impinging upon such second object within substantially only such second bonding area; means for effecting movement of said first and second focused beams relative to and impinging within such first and second bonding areas, respectively, to repeatedly heat such objects within such bonding areas to a melt fusion point; and means effecting relative movement of said first means and said second means toward one another for joining such first and second objects along such predetermined bonding areas. 2. The apparatus as specified in claim 1 wherein: said means for effecting relative movement of said first and second focused beams reciprocates said beams with respect to such areas. 3. The apparatus as specified in claim 1 wherein: said means for effecting relative movement of said first and second focused beams causes said beams to move along an endless path.
