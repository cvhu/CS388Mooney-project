A feed apparatus employs a vision controlled robotic manipulator in which components are dispersed into a single layer with a random orientation. The dispersing mechanism comprises a vibratory feed plate having an input hopper which receives components to be dispersed. The feed plate is controllably vibrated such that components are urged along its top surface. Located in the travel path of the components above the feed plate is a rotating cylindrical brush, which sweeps components as they are being vibrated by the feed plate and causes a single layer of components to emerge from beneath the brush and pass to a viewing/pick-up zone. This zone is backlighted, so that the components may be observed by a camera mounted directly above the backlighted layer. The camera image is analyzed by a video data processor to determine the location and orientation of a component. This information is applied to a manipulator control program for driving a robotic manipulator to pick-up a component for transport to a workpiece. The end effector of the robotic manipulator comprises a vacuum tip mounted to an end of the arm of the manipulator which is pivotable about an axis from a vertical position whereat a component may be seized to a horizontal position. At the horizontal position a set of gripping fingers is provided for seizing a component that has been captured and pivoted thereto by the vacuum tip and which is displaced in the vertical direction to cause the component to be released by the vacuum tip.
Claims What is claimed: 1. An end effector for an arm of a robotic manipulator comprising: a first component seizure device mounted to an end of said arm and controllably pivotable about an axis from a first position whereat a component may be seized thereby to a second position; and a second component seizure device mounted to said end of said arm adjacent to said second position and including means for seizing a component delivered thereto by said first component seizing device and causing said delivered component to be released by said first component seizure device; and wherein said first component seizure device comprises a vacuum element engageable with a component to be captured thereby by means of suction between said vacuum element and said component, said vacuum element being pivotable about said axis between said first position and said second position, and wherein said second component seizure device comprises a mechanical gripping device for mechanically gripping said component that has been captured by said vacuum element and causing said component to be released therefrom. 2.
