The present invention provides methods for identifying an agent that specifically binds and/or modulates one topology of a chemokine receptor but not a second topology of the receptor. Such agents are useful as therapeutics for diseases or conditions associated with a particular chemokine receptor topology. Moreover, the agents are useful for detecting a particular topology of a chemokine receptor, thereby diagnosing disease or predisposition for a disease. In addition, the agents are useful for identifying and isolating cells that express a particular topology of a chemokine receptor.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of identifying a cancer cell having a chemokine receptor, wherein the cell is from a tissue, the method comprising contacting the cell with I-TAC and SDF-1; and determining whether I-TAC and SDF-1 compete with each other for binding on the chemokine receptor, wherein competition for binding indicates the presence of a cancer cell. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the identified cancer cell is selected from the group consisting of a breast cancer cell, an ovarian cancer cell, cervical cancer cell, a Burkitt's lymphoma cell and a glioblastoma cell.
