Compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of exportin 5. The compositions comprise oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acid encoding exportin 5. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of exportin 5 expression and for diagnosis and treatment of diseases and conditions associated with expression of exportin 5 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inhibiting expression of exportin 5 in a cell comprising: contacting said cell with an antisense compound comprising an oligonucleotide consisting of 20 linked nucleosides, wherein the oligonucleotide has a nucleobase sequence comprising at least 12 contiguous nucleobases of SEQ ID NO:83, wherein nucleosides 1-5 are 2'-O-methoxyethyl modified nucleosides, nucleosides 6-10 are 2'-deoxyribonucleosides, nucleosides 11-20 are 2'-O-methoxyethyl modified nucleosides, wherein each of the internucleoside linkages is a phosphorothioate. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said oligonucleotide is 100% complementary to the nucleic acid molecule encoding exportin 5. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound inhibits exportin 5 by at least 40% as compared to saline. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound inhibits exportin 5 by at least 50% as compared to saline. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound inhibits exportin 5 by at least 60% as compared to saline. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the nucleic acid encoding exportin 5 has the nucleobase sequence described in SEQ ID NO: 4.
