A moving coil linear motor having a central row of alternating, permanent magnets, with multi-phase, multi-pole coil assemblies located on both sides of the magnet row. Magnetic circuit completion material is located approximately the same height as the magnets and outside the coil assemblies. The coil assemblies are formed of a series of individual coils connected in a multi-phase, multi-pole relationship. At locations other than the coil assembly ends, the individual coils of a phase are adjacent and connected so that a current passes through them in a uniform direction. The individual coil total width is equal to the distance from a point on a magnet to the same point on the adjacent magnet, with the individual coil thickness being the total width divided by twice the number of phases. The coil assembly is coated with an epoxy to improve thermal mass and thermal conductivity and a phenolic to resist abrasion and the environment.
