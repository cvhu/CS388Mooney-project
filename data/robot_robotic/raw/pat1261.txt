An injection molding process for the preparation of an oral delivery device comprising a core which contains a pharmaceutically active agent, having a coating with one or more openings leading to such a core. The invention also relates to devices produced by the process, and to injection molds suitable for performing the process.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A mold for forming a device comprising a core which includes a pharmaceutically active agent covered by an injection-molded outer coating having at least one opening communicating from the exterior of the device to the core, in which the outer coating is applied by injection molding of said coating around said core, said mold having a cavity in which said core may be located with a space around the said core to define the required shape and dimensions of the coating and a guide channel leading from the mold cavity to the exterior of the mold, said mold cavity having an interior surface, at least one internal member extending from the interior surface of the mold cavity, and mounted for sliding movement relative to the mold cavity in said guide channel in both directions along an imaginary line extending through said core, to abut the said core and to define the shape and position of the said at least one opening, means for injecting a moldable fluid into said space around said core to form said outer coating, and resilient means bearing on a portion of said at least one internal member located outside the mold and urging said at least one internal member into abutment with the core with a biasing force sufficient to prevent pressure exerted by the injected moldable fluid on said at least one internal member from moving said at least one internal member out of engagement with the core. 2. A mold according to claim 1, having two parts which are separable from each other, and which come together by relative vertical movement.
