The present invention relates to a substrate for attachment of biomolecules. The substrate is coated with a multiamino organosilane. If desired, the substrate can be further modified prior to coating with a multiamino organosilane. Optional surface modifications include coating the substrate with SiO.sub.2 or leaching with acid to form a SiO.sub.2 rich layer. DNA, nucleic acids, or any bimolecules can be attached to the coated substrates of the invention. Although a variety of substrates are contemplated, the preferred substrate is a low self-fluorescent glass.
