The present invention defines a unique, flexible system that may be applied to the manufacture and assembly of a plurality of highly configurable and reusable virtual robotic control devices. It is specifically concerned with providing a plurality of self contained virtual control systems that comprise a moving part that is detected by an associated sensor whereby signals may be generated and transmitted to a plurality of other devices to operate a plurality of robotic microscopes directly or, when configured through a robot control program, through an intermediate computer and network. Furthermore, these virtual robotic control systems may be assembled into a number of partial or complete robotic microscopes so that the degree of realism and control over the examination of a slide may be matched more exactly to the needs and requirements of a microscopist.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A First Virtual Slide Device comprising: at least one first panel with a size and shape comparable to a glass slide such that the at least one first panel is configured to be movable across a surface as at least one first microscopist would move a glass slide across a microscope stage; at least one first slot manufactured into said at least one first panel; at least one second slot manufacture into said at least one first panel such that each said at least one first and said at least one second slot are located at opposite corners of said at least one first panel; at least one second panel of same size and shape with at least one third and at least one fourth slot manufacture into said at least one second panel such that each said at least one third and said at least one fourth slot are located at opposite corners in mirror image to said at least one first and said at least one second slots whereby when said at least one first panel is placed over said at least one second panel said at least one first slot and said at least one third slot line up and said at least one second and said at least one fourth slot line up; at least one first electromagnetic device enclosed by said at least one first and said at least one third slot; at least one second electromagnetic device enclosed by said at least one second and said at least one fourth slot; at least one fifth slot manufactured into said at least one first panel; at least one sixth slot manufactured into said at least one second panel; and at least one first power source enclosed by said at least one fifth and said at least one sixth slot whereby, when connected to said at least one first and said at least one second electromagnetic devices causes signals to be generated that are detectable by at least one other device. 2. The First Virtual Slide Device as recited in claim 1, further comprising: at least one second panel attached to at least one surface of said at least one first virtual slide device to facilitate movement of said at least one virtual slide device across a surface by a said at least one first microscopist using said at least one second panel. 3. The First Virtual Slide Device as recited in claim 1, further comprising: at least one first depression made in at least one surface of said at least one first virtual slide device to facilitate movement of said at least one first panel across a surface by placement of a finger or other object in said at least one first depression. 4. The First Virtual Slide Device as recited in claim 1, further comprising: at least one first video display device assembled to at least one surface of said at least one first virtual slide device whereby images and symbolic data are receivable from at least one other device and displayed such that at least one first image of a microscopic object residing on at least one first slide residing on at least one first robotic microscope is visible and that at least one first alphanumeric symbol representing identification of said at least one first slide is visible. 5. The First Virtual Slide Device as recited in claim 1, further comprising: at least one first glass slide.
