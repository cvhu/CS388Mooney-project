Plastic injection-compression multi-cavity molding of flash-free improved-cleanliness thermoplastic spectacle lenses are suitable to be robotically dip hardcoated. Special spring-loaded molds having variable-volume mold cavities are used in an injection-compression molding process to form, without parting line flash, pairs of a wide range of differing optical power of polycarbonate Rx spectacle lenses. These pairs have special molded-on design features which are specially suited for full automation, starting with a novel way for ejection out of the mold into a takeout robot which is integrated via full automation with subsequent dip hardcoating. A molded-on tab with each pair of lenses is specially suited for manipulation by SCARA type robot. This combination produces micro-clean hardcoated paired molded lens made entirely within a single continuous cleanroom air enclosure surrounding the lenses, without any human operators therein, nor requiring any cutting or trimming of the molded paired lens or runner system before hardcoating, nor use of Freon (tm) CFC nor aqueous cleaning protocols before dipcoating. An extension of this cleanroom enclosure and robotic handling scheme may optionally provide in-line continuous-product-flow automatic inspection of optical power and lens cosmetic quality, and/or may optionally provide in-line continuous-product-flow anti-reflective thin film vacuum coating, before the molded-and-hardcoated polycarbonate lenses exit out of the continuous cleanroom air enclosure and/or receive any manual handling.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An improved-cleanliness molding process for particulate-minimizing automated ejection of molded pairs of thermoplastic spectacle lenses out of a multi-cavity injection-compression moldset, comprising the steps of: a.) Forming at least one molded pair of lenses within paired variable-volume mold cavities having a cavity height determined by extendable resilient members in the injection-compression moldset, said mold cavities having optically polished partforming surfaces on opposing paired first side convex inserts and second side concave inserts, said mold cavities being edge-gated along a side quadrant of said lens and in fluid communication with an injection source of molten thermoplastic located substantially equidistant between said mold cavities to form at a parting line a cold sprue and cold runner when allowed to cool, the cold sprue and cold-runner having a mechanical retention on one side of the parting line, with at least one hanger tab per pair of molded lenses extending from said cold sprue and cold runner, and said molded paired lens edges having a drafted surface suited for clean release from bores of said mold cavities; b.) Cooling said molded paired lenses until the thermoplastic is shape stable; c.) Ejecting said molded paired lenses by: i) decreasing mold clamping forces exerted along the parting line until the mold clamping forces are less than a force exerted by said resilient members, so as to extend said resilient members, thereby separating said molded paired lenses from the optically-polished partforming surfaces of the first side convex inserts and creating a release space, before the parting line formed between the first side and the second side separates, ii) pulling said molded paired lenses off the optically-polished partforming surfaces of the second side concave inserts as the parting line begins to separate, while mechanical retaining said molded paired lenses onto the first side, iii) stripping said molded paired lens off the first side mechanical retention, once the moldset is fully open along the parting line, only after an end-of-arm tooling of a takeout robot is in place to receive said molded paired lenses, the takeout robot gripping the paired lenses. 2. An improved-cleanliness molding process for particulate-minimizing automated ejection of molded pairs of thermoplastic spectacle lenses out of a multi-cavity injection moldset within one cleanroom air envelope within which no human operators work, comprising the steps of: a.) Forming at least one molded paired lenses within paired mold cavities having optically polished partforming surfaces on opposing paired A side concave inserts and B side convex inserts, said mold cavities being edge-gated along a side quadrant of said lens and in fluid communication with an injection source of molten thermoplastic located substantially equidistant between said mold cavities to form a cold sprue and cold runner therebetween when allowed to cool, the cold sprue and cold-runner having a B side mechanical retention, with at least one hanger tab per pair of molded lenses extending from said cold sprue and cold runner, the hanger tab having a head geometry mated to a robotic device workholder, and said molded paired lens edges having a drafted surface suited for clean release from bores of said mold cavities; b.) Cooling said molded paired lenses until the thermoplastic is shape stable; c.) Ejecting said molded paired lenses by i) releasing mold clamping force but not substantially opening the parting line, while separating said molded paired lenses off the optically-polished partforming surfaces of A side concave inserts with a filtered air blowoff assisted by an edge seal and separating said molded paired lenses off the optically-polished partforming surfaces of B side convex inserts by a filtered air blowoff, with a drafted surface of the lens edge assisting separation off the mold cavity bore surface; ii) completely opening a parting line and stripping said molded paired lenses off the B side mechanical retention that held them, once the moldset is fully opened up along the parting line and after an end-of-arm tooling of a takeout robot is in place to receive said molded paired lenses while being stripped off of the B side mechanical retention; d.) removing automatically the end-of-arm tooling of the takeout robot in coordination with clamping motions of the injection molding machine, so the moldset can close and the injection molding machine can start another molding cycle, and the end-of-arm tooling of the takeout robot retracts to at least a second position of travel within said one cleanroom air envelope, wherein at least one robotic transfer takes place so that said molded paired lenses are now gripped by at least a second robotic device at a head on a topmost end of a stem of said hanger tab, and said second robotic device also operating within said one cleanroom air envelope then performs a prescribed dip immersion and withdrawal of said molded paired lenses into and out of a liquid hardcoating solution maintained within a continuously circulating and filtered diptank; e.) transferring robotically within said one cleanroom air envelope, through a curing workstation wherein any devolatilization of solvent occurs and wherein at least partial cure to a tackfree state is achieved by a chemical crosslinking reaction of the hardcoating; f.) Transferring said molded paired lenses now hardcoated, out of said one cleanroom air envelope, at which point they can be safely handled by human operators without fear of airborne contamination which could not be removed by cleaning or wiping. 3. A process of claim 2 wherein an additional step of robotic transfer of immersion within a circulating filtered alcohol bath for a predetermined length of time takes place after the ejecting steps but before the dip immersion and withdrawal step. 4. A process of claim 3 wherein said prescribed dip immersion and withdrawal of said molded paired lenses into and out of a liquid hardcoating solution is to a liquid level at least higher than the topmost lens edge surface of said paired lens but below the head on the topmost end of the stem of the hanger tab, thereby avoiding liquid dipbath contact with gripping means of the second robotic device. 5. A process of claim 2 wherein said head at topmost gripping position of said hanger tab is inserted by the second robotic device into a tapered lead-angle aperture, for positive retention as a molded plastic spring therein by means of an open-end horseshoe shape with retention detents on each of two legs which can be deflected into a narrower shape when squeezed together or pushed in insertion. 6. A process of claim 2 wherein said head at topmost gripping position of said hanger tab is handed off by the second robotic device into a workholder nest which retains said molded paired lens therein by gravity, by means of said head joining to the stem in a transition from wide to narrow in a tapered lead-angle geometry which by design is mated to the workholder nest having substantially mirror-image geometry of slightly greater lead angle taper, in the automated transfers from molding to alcohol bath to hardcoating dipbath to curing workstation. 7. A process of claim 2 wherein said spectacle lenses are for vision correction, and wherein the thermoplastic of said spectacle lenses is polycarbonate.
