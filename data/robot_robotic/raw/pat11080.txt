A tooling support apparatus in which a linear tooling boom has one end adapted to support a tooling member and its opposite end connected to a scissors-lift apparatus for adjusting the height and horizontal position of the tooling boom.
Claims Having described my invention, I claim: 1. Tooling support apparatus, comprising: a support; an elongated tooling boom having a first end and an opposite second end, the first end being adapted to support tooling means; structure connecting the second end of the boom to the support for adjusting the distance between the support and the boom to relocate the position of the tooling means, said structure comprising: a first scissors arm having an upper end and a lower end; a second scissors arm having an upper end and a lower end; a first pivot means pivotally connecting the upper end of the first scissors arm to the support; second pivot means pivotally connecting the lower end of the first scissors arm to the boom; third pivot means connecting the upper end of the second scissors arm to the support; fourth pivot means connecting the lower end of the second scissors arm to the boom; fifth pivot means connecting the first scissors arm to the second scissors arm; and first means for moving the first scissors arm and the second scissors arm with respect to one another so as to move the lower ends of the first scissors arm and the second scissors arm with respect to the support, whereby the boom is raised or lowered depending upon the motion of the upper end of the first scissors arm with respect to the upper end of the second scissors arm. 2. A combination as defined in claim 1, including a threaded rod mounted on the support, an internally threaded member mounted on the threaded rod so as to be moveable therealong as the threaded rod is being rotated about its longitudinal axis; a handle connected to the threaded rod for rotating it; and means connecting the upper end of one of the scissors arms to the internally threaded members for moving it as the handle is being rotated. 3. A combination as defined in claim 1, in which the structure comprises a first tubular member connected to the lower end of one of the scissors arms; a second tubular member connected to the lower end of the second scissors arm, the second tubular member being telescopically received in the first tubular member so as to be moveable therealong as the first scissors arm is being moved with respect to the second scissors arm; and means for connecting the boom to one of said tubular means such that the boom is moveable in a horizontal direction as the first scissors arm is being moved with respect 4. A combination as defined in claim 1, in which the tooling boom is a linear member along its full length. 5. Tooling support apparatus, comprising: an upper support; a lower support; scissors means connecting the upper support and the lower support, such that the lower support may be raised toward or lowered from the upper support as the scissors means is being moved; an elongated threaded member mounted on the upper support; a nut mounted on the threaded member so as to be moveable therealong as the threaded member is being rotated about its longitudinal axis, either in a first rotational direction to increase the distance between the lower support and the upper support, or in the opposite, second rotational direction to reduce the distance between the lower support and the upper support; means connecting the scissors means to be the nut for moving the scissors means as the threaded member is being rotated; an elongated tooling boom having a first end and a second end, the second end being adapted to support tooling means; and means for adjusting connecting the first end of the tooling boom to the lower support so as to adjust the horizontal distance between the upper support and the second end of the tooling boom; whereby the tooling boom is suspended beneath the upper support, and the distance between the tooling boom and the upper support depends upon the location of the nut on the threaded member. 6. Tooling support apparatus as defined in claim 5, including a handle connected to the threaded member for rotating same.
