A method of developing a new coating having a desired performance characteristic with regard to a property of a coating is provided. The method includes the steps of: a) providing an array of coating wells, each well configured for receiving a coating material having a known parameter; b) placing a coating material having the known parameter in each coating well, varying the parameter so as to provide a plurality of coating material having different parameter values in a plurality of coating wells; c) correlating the value of the parameter for the coatings deposited in each of the plurality of coating wells with the position of the coating well in the array, whereby a parameter value is associated with each coating well position in the array; d) applying a coating leveling force to the array of coating wells to level the coating material in the coating wells; e) testing the coatings in the array to analyze the relationship between the position in the array and performance with regard to the property of the coating material, whereby the value of the parameter can be correlated to the performance of the coating with regard to the property of the coating. Optionally, the coatings in the array may be dried while the leveling force is applied. The above combinatorial, high-throughput method of screening candidate coat materials results in a substantial increase in the discovery rate of new coating materials. The moisture barrier characteristics of a film may be determined by providing a vapor sensitive color changing layer, with the film to be measured overlying the vapor sensitive layer, exposing the film to the vapor, and subsequently measuring the color changes.
