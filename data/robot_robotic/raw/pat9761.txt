An apparatus and method for detecting anomalies in ferrous pipe structures is presented. An electrical current is passed through the ferrous pipe structure so as to create a magnetic field in the pipe. A sensor having one or more sensor shoe members is placed in the interior of a ferrous pipe structure to be inspected. Each sensor shoe member has one or more magnetometer elements for detecting the magnetic fields in the region of the ferrous pipe structure adjacent to which the sensor shoe member is placed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure, of the kind employing an apparatus including a sensor to be positioned in and propelled along the interior of the ferrous pipe structure wherein the sensor includes at least one sensor shoe member; the method for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure comprising the steps of: placing the at least one sensor shoe member within the interior of the ferrous pipe structure at a desired location to be inspected; measuring any present remnant magnetic field within the ferrous pipe structure; imposing a first magnetic field, from an external source, onto the ferrous pipe structure and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure; imposing a second magnetic field of reversed polarity onto the ferrous pipe structure with the external source and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure; comparing the remnant magnetic field measured with the magnetic fields measured after imposition of the first and second magnetic fields to yield data representative of anomalies in the ferrous pipe structure at the desired location. 2. The method for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure, according to claim 1, wherein the steps of imposing a first magnetic field, from an external source, onto the ferrous pipe structure and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure; and imposing a second magnetic field of reversed polarity onto the ferrous pipe structure with the external source and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure, further comprise the steps of: providing a source of electrical current; connecting the source of electrical current to the pipe structure, at positions upstream and downstream from the desired location to be inspected; actuating the source of electrical current so as to cause electrical current to pass along the pipe structure through the desired location to be inspected; reversing the polarity of the source of electrical current, relative to the pipe structure and actuating the source of electrical current, so as to cause the current to flow in reverse direction through the pipe structure through the desired location to be inspected.
