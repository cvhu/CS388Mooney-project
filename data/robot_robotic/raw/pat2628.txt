A number of wafer center finding methods and systems are disclosed herein that improve upon existing techniques used in semiconductor manufacturing.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A semiconductor handling device comprising a plurality of center-finding systems including: a first system that determines a location of a center of a wafer by detecting wafer presence during a robotic movement that includes at least one rotation; a second system that determines the location of the center of the wafer using a plurality of sensors consisting of two sensors for each one of a plurality of entrances to an interior of a robotic handler, the second system applying an extended Kalman Filter to estimate a position of the wafer based upon encoder data from one or more robots; and a third system that determines the location of the center of the wafer using a contact image sensor to capture image data from a second interior of a second robotic handler while the wafer moves therethrough.
