An autonomous robot, that is for example, suitable for operations such as vacuuming and surface cleaning includes a payload configured for vacuum cleaning, a drive system including a steering system, a navigation system, and a control system for integrating operations of the aforementioned systems.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for confining an apparatus for autonomous operation to a portion of an area comprising: providing an apparatus for autonomous operation comprising: a drive system; and at least one sensor in communication with the drive system, the at least one sensor configured for detecting at least a first signal and a second signal for controlling the drive system; transmitting a first signal and an adjacent second signal to create a boundary for the portion of the area in which the apparatus for autonomous operation is to be confined, and, to create a boundary space between the first signal and the second signal; and operating the apparatus for autonomous operation in the portion of the area including: maintaining the apparatus for autonomous operation in the portion of the area in response to detecting the first signal; and maintaining the apparatus for autonomous operation in the portion of the area and preventing the apparatus from leaving the portion of the area in response to detecting the second signal, if one of: i) the first signal is not detected, or ii) the apparatus for autonomous operation is located in the boundary space between the first and second signals. 2. The method of claim 1, additionally comprising, positioning a transmitter for transmitting the first signal and the second signal to designate the portion of the area in which the apparatus for autonomous operation is to be confined. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein operating the apparatus for autonomous operation additionally includes vacuum cleaning.
