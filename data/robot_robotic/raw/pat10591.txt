In a soldering system which utilizes a fine jet of very hot gas for heating the work point the hot air may impinge directly on the work point or it may heat a soldering tip from within whereby it may be used in a more conventional mode of soldering or desoldering. A regulated flow of gas to the heater of the soldering instrument may be somewhat preheated by passing along the leads carrying the electric power to the heating element. The same supply of air may also be used to cool the handle of the handle of the soldering instrument for operator comfort and safety. The temperature of the heating element is remotely electronically controlled by a time share use of the power leads as temperature sensing and feedback.
Claims I claim: 1. Hot gas soldering system comprising: base housing body; electric power supply means carried therein for energizing a soldering gas heater; electronically remotely controlled temperature control circuit carried by said housing body; gas supply flow conrol means carried by said housing body; soldering tool holding means carried by said housing body; hot gas soldering tool having handle portion, electric heating element carried by said handle portion and coupled to said electric power supply and said temperature control circuit, gas heating means connected to said gas supply control means for transferring heat from said heating element to said gas, soldering gas jet forming means coupled to said gas heating means for causing the heated gas to impinge upon and heat a predetermined soldering point, and combination hose and electric conductors means connecting said housing body and said handle portion, the conductors being disposed within said hose, and said hose also constituting a carrier of said gas from said housing body to said hot gas soldering tool, said hot gas tool further including: a hollow metal tubular sheath carried by said handle portion and extending forwardly therefrom, a hollow ceramic cylindrical heating element support tube upon the outer surface of the forward end of which is disposed said electric heating element, said heating element support tube being carried within and radially spaced from said metal tubular sheath to form a first heating chamber component of said gas heating means, an inner, gas circulator tube carried by the forward end of said metal tubular sheath and extending rearwardly therefrom for approximately the length of said electric heating element and being disposed within and radially spaced from said hollow ceramic support tube to form thereby a second heating chamber component of said gas heating means, and gas flow means connecting to the interior of said handle portion for carrying gas from said combination hose means, through the interior of said handle portion, forwardly along the length of said first heating chamber, radially inwardly over the forward end of said ceramic heating element support tube, rearwardly along the length of said second heating chamber, radially inwardly over the rear end of said circulator tube, and forwardly toward said soldering work point. 2. The invention as set forth in claim 1 in which said gas heating means includes a spiral filamentary body wrapped about said ceramic support tube along the length of said first heating chamber for increasing the heat exchange between said heating element and the gas. 3. The invention as set forth in claim 2 in which said gas heating means includes a spiral filamentary body wrapped about said collector tube along the length of said second heating chamber for increasing the heat exchange between said heating element and the gas. 4. The invention as set forth in claim 1 which further includes a soldering tip carried by the forward end of said tubular metal sheath, said soldering tip having a hollow interior open to its rear to receive the gas flow from said circulator tube, closed across its front, soldering surface end for impingement of the gas flow thereon, and having gas exhaust ports rearwardly of said front, soldering surface end for releasing the spent gas to the environment of said tool.
