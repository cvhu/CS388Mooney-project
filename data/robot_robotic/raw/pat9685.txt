A control apparatus and method for controlling a remote actuator, the control apparatus having a kinesthetic feedback system for providing a kinesthetic sensation to the operator as a physical sensation representative of the resistive forces encountered by the remote actuator. The control apparatus is configured to be releasably mounted to the hand of the operator with control modules supported at preselected joints of the hand. The control modules sense changes in the angular orientation in the respective joints and generate a control signal as a function of the change. This control signal is used to drive the corresponding actuator. Each actuator includes a sensor to sense resistive forces encountered by the actuator and generate a response signal as a function of the resistive forces. A magnetostrictive clutch mechanism on the control module is controlled by the response signal to provide a resistive force against movement of the control module thereby providing a kinesthetic sensation to the hand of the operator.
