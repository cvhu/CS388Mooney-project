The present disclosure describes 6-disubstituted bicyclic nucleosides, oligomeric compounds prepared therefrom and methods of using the oligomeric compounds. More particularly, the 6-disubstituted bicyclic nucleosides each comprise a 2'-O--C(Ri)(R2)-4' or 2'-O--C=(R3)(R.4)-4' bridge wherein each R is, independently a substituent group and Ri and R2 include H. The 6-disubstituted bicyclic nucleosides are useful for enhancing properties of oligomeric compounds including nuclease resistance. In certain embodiments, the oligomeric compounds provided herein hybridize to a portion of a target RNA resulting in loss of normal function of the target RNA.
