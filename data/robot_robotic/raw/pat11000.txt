Robotic liquid separation operates independently of liquid volume, viscosity, or optical characteristics, by sensing changes in the dielectric constant of the liquid as it is being drawn through a cannula. The cannula has electrodes which form a sensing capacitor for detecting the changes in the liquid dielectric constant as the liquid is drawn therethrough.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A liquid separation sensor for use in combination with a cannula liquid delivery system for detecting when a liquid being delivered through the system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of such properties of the liquid as volume, viscosity, optical characteristics, or the time required for the liquid to be delivered, comprising: (a) a substantially non-metallic conduit portion in the liquid path in the cannula liquid delivery system; (b) a first electrode located substantially adjacent said non-metallic conduit portion; (c) a second electrode located substantially adjacent said first electrode and also substantially adjacent said non-metallic conduit portion; (d) said electrodes being configured to form a sensing capacitor for detecting changes in the dielectric constants of liquids passing therepast in said non-metallic conduit portion; (e) capacitance sensing means connected to said electrodes for detecting such changes in the dielectric constants of such liquids as the liquids are delivered through the cannula system, and thereby detecting when a liquid being delivered through the cannula system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of other properties of the liquid; (f) a reversible pump disposed in the cannula liquid delivery system for moving said liquids therethrough; and (g) means for reversing said pump upon detection of such a change in the liquid to expel a predetermined volume of liquid from the cannula liquid delivery system substantially equal to the volume of the system between its intake and said electrodes. 2. The sensor of claim 1 wherein said electrodes each substantially surround a portion of said non-metallic conduit portion. 3. A liquid separation sensor for use in combination with a cannula liquid delivery system for detecting when a liquid being delivered through the system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of such properties of the liquid as volume, viscosity, optical characteristics, or the time required for the liquid to be delivered comprising: (a) a substantially non-metallic conduit portion in the liquid path in the cannula liquid delivery system; (b) a first electrode substantially surrounding a first portion of said non-metallic conduit portion; (c) a second electrode substantially surrounding a second portion of said non-metallic conduit portion, said second electrode located substantially adjacent said first electrode; (d) said electrodes being configured to form a sensing capacitor for detecting changes in the dielectric constants of liquids passing therepast in said non-metallic conduit portion; (e) capacitance sensing means connected to said electrodes for detecting such changes in the dielectric constants of such liquids as the liquids are delivered through the cannula system, and thereby detecting when a liquid being delivered through the cannula system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of other properties of the liquid; (f) a reversible pump in the cannula liquid delivery system for moving such liquids therethrough; and (g) means for reversing said pump upon detection of such a change in the liquid to expel a predetermined volume of liquid from the cannula liquid delivery system substantially equal to the volume of the system between its intake and said electrodes. 4. A liquid separation method for use in combination with a cannula liquid delivery system for detecting when a liquid being delivered through the system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of such properties of the liquid as volume, viscosity, optical characteristics, or the time required for the liquid to be delivered, comprising: (a) positioning the electrodes of a sensing capacitor substantially adjacent a substantially non-metallic conduit portion in the liquid path in the cannula liquid delivery system, said conduit portion and the liquid flowing therethrough forming the dielectric of said sensing capacitor; (b) detecting changes in the dielectric constants of liquids passing between said electrodes in the non-metallic conduit portion as the liquids are delivered through the cannula system to detect when a liquid being delivered through the cannula system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of other properties of the liquid; (c) moving the liquids through the cannula liquid delivery system with a reversible pump; and (d) reversing the pump upon detecting of such a change in the liquid to expel a predetermined volume of liquid from the cannula liquid delivery system substantially equal to the volume of the system between its intake and the sensing capacitor. 5. A liquid separation method for use in combination with a cannula liquid delivery system for detecting when a liquid being delivered through the system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of such properties of the liquid as volume, viscosity, optical characteristics, or the time required for the liquid to be delivered, comprising: (a) positioning a sensing capacitor substantially adjacent a substantially non-metallic conduit portion in the liquid path in the cannula liquid delivery system, the sensing capacitor being comprised of a first electrode located substantially adjacent the non-metallic conduit portion, and a second electrode located substantially adjacent the first electrode and also substantially adjacent the non-metallic conduit portion, the electrodes each substantially surrounding a portion of the non-metallic conduit portion; (b) detecting changes in the dielectric constants of liquids passing the sensing capacitor in the non-metallic conduit portion as the liquids are delivered through the cannula system to detect when a liquid being delivered through the cannula system has changed to another type of liquid, independently of other properties of the liquid; (c) moving the liquids through the cannula liquid delivery system with a reversible pump; and (d) reversing the pump upon detection of such a change in the liquid to expel a predetermined volume of liquid from the cannula liquid delivery system substantially equal to the volume of the system between its intake and the electrodes.
