A robot gripper module having a housing pivotally mountable to an end of a robot arm. The housing encloses a first motor for pivoting the housing about a pivot joint, and a second motor operating a rack-and-pinion gear arrangement for extending and retracting fingers. Two opposed groups attached to a rack on opposite sides of a pinion gear. Turning the pinion gear causes the fingers to move toward or away from one another. The motors which may operate independently of the robot arm, may be either servo or stepper motors. The gripper module provides additional degrees of freedom from that of the robot arm, enabling it to work with many kinds of robot arms.
