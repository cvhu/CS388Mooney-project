A process for preweakening the inside of an automotive trim piece cover layer of various constructions by use of a laser beam so as to enable formation of an air bag deployment opening in the trim piece formed at the time the air bag deploys. The laser beam impinges the inside surface of the cover to form a groove scoring or spaced perforations to form a preweakening pattern. A robot arm may be used to move a laser generator so as to form the preweakening pattern. The laser beam can be controlled in accordance with sensed conditions to achieve accurate preweakening, and may also be used to trim substrate panels and to perform other cutting operations.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A process for constructing a preweakened automotive interior trim piece comprising an instrument panel covering an air bag installation, said preweakening extending in a predetermined pattern enabling formation of an air bag deployment opening in said instrument panel by pressure exerted by an air bag deploying from said air bag installation mounted on the inside of said trim piece, said process including the steps of: constructing said instrument panel with a thin pliant plastic outer cover layer defining an outer surface extending smoothly and uninterruptedly over said predetermined pattern; preweakening said constructed instrument panel by directing a laser beam at an inner surface of said instrument panel and along said predetermined pattern so as to produce a scoring therein partially penetrating an inner surface of said outer cover layer along said predetermined pattern; and said preweakening step including controlling said scoring by said laser beam so as to cut a series of repeating spaced apart deep scoring penetrations extending partially into the inside of said trim piece cover with intervening uncut material between said deep scoring penetrations thereby forming a varying depth laser scored groove in said outer cover layer which has a lower resistance to tearing along said predetermined pattern by the pressure exerted by said deploying air bag because of the presence of said deep scoring penetrations while said intervening uncut material strengthens said outer cover layer to reduce any tendency for preweakening said pattern to become visible from said outer surface prior to air bag deployment or to develop cracks in said outer cover sensing the remaining thickness of said instrument panel outer cover layer beyond said scoring during said laser beam scoring, and controlling said laser beam scoring in correspondence to said sensed remaining thickness so as to maintain a predetermined minimum remaining thickness of said instrument panel outer cover layer beyond said scoring to avoid cracking along said pattern. 2. The process according to claim 1 wherein said sensing step is carried out using a sensor located on the outer surface side of said instrument panel. 3. A process for constructing a preweakened automotive interior trim piece comprising an instrument panel covering an air bag installation, said preweakening extending in a predetermined pattern enabling formation of an air bag deployment opening in said instrument panel by pressure exerted by an air bag deploying from said air bag installation mounted on the inside of said trim piece, said process including: constructing said instrument panel with a thin pliant plastic outer cover layer defining an outer surface extending smoothly and uninterruptedly over said predetermined pattern; preweakening said constructed instrument panel by directing a laser beam at an inner surface of said instrument panel and along said predetermined pattern so as to produce a scoring therein partially penetrating an inner surface of said outer cover layer along said predetermined pattern; said laser beam is controlled during said scoring of said inner surface of said outer cover layer so as to score a series of closely spaced repeating partial penetrations into said inner surface of said outer cover layer while leaving unscored intervening cover layer material between said partial penetrations, said series of repeating partial penetrations extending along a path defining said predetermined pattern and comprising a stepped depth scoring into said inner surface of said outer cover layer; and sensing the remaining thickness of said instrument panel outer cover layer beyond said scoring during said laser beam scoring, and controlling said laser beam scoring in correspondence to said sensed remaining thickness so as to substantially maintain a predetermined minimum remaining thickness of said instrument panel outer cover layer beyond said scoring such that said minimum remaining thickness of said instrument panel outer cover layer along said predetermined pattern is sufficiently thin to be readily severed by said pressure exerted by said deploying air bag but sufficiently thick so that said predetermined pattern will not be visible from said outer surface prior to air bag deployment nor develop cracks in said outer cover layer.
