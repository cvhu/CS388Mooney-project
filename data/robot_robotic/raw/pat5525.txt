In an arrangement for the transfer of plates between a plate conveyor and a holding structure by a transport arm, which is pivotally supported with one end on a support structure and pivotally supports at its other end a plate holder for engaging a plate selectively from the top or the bottom thereof, and wherein the conveyor includes a recess for receiving the plate holder to permit engagement of a plate on the conveyor from the bottom thereof, two linkages are provided for controlling the pivot movement of the plate holder during the transfer of the plates and provided with releasable engagement structures for a selective connection with the plate holder to control the pivoting of the plate holder during plate transfer such that the plate surface opposite the plate holder is disposed adjacent the holding structure.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An arrangement for transferring plates between a plate conveyor (1) and a holding structure (2) comprising: a support structure (3), a transport arm (4) pivotally supported with one end on said support structure (3) and carrying, at its free end remote from said support structure (3), a plate engagement device (5) for engaging and holding a plate P to be transferred between said plate conveyor and said holding structure (2), said plate engagement device (5) being pivotally supported on said transport arm (4) and having engagement devices selectively facing downwardly for engaging a plate (P) on said plate conveyor (1) from the top side thereof or facing upwardly so as to engage said plate (P) from the bottom side thereof, said plate conveyor (1) having recesses permitting the introduction of the plate engagement device (5) into the plate conveyor (1) below a plate disposed on the conveyor (1) to permit engagement of a plate P disposed on the conveyor (1) from the bottom of the plate P, and said arrangement including two separate linkages connected with one of their ends to said support structure (3) and being provided at their opposite ends with an engagement mechanism for operative connection to the plate engagement device (5) such that selectively either one of the two linkages is connected to the plate engagement device (5) while the other is idled, said linkages being so arranged that, upon pivoting of the transport arm (4) with the plate engagement device (5) disposed above or respectively below the plate (P) controls the pivot movement of the plate engagement device (5) such that in each case, the face of the plate P opposite the plate engagement device (5) is disposed adjacent the holding structure (2). 2. An arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the plate engagement device (5) is a suction frame with a plurality of suction heads (51) forming engagement members. 3. An arrangement according to claim 1, wherein each linkage (6, 7) comprises a link member (61, 71) connected to the support structure (3, 8) and another link pivotally connected to the respective link member (61, 71) and to the engagement device (5) and being provided at the opposite end with an engagement structure including a coupling mechanism for coupling the respective link member (61, 71) to the plate engagement device (5) for controlling its pivot movement by the movement of the transport arm (4) depending on the position of the plate engagement device (5) below or above the plate (P).
