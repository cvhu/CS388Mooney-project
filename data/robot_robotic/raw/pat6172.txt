A polymer is plasticized in a plasticizing unit and is thereafter fed into a transfer device which is moved into alignment with a clamping press which is remotely located from the plasticizing unit. The polymer from the transfer device is deposited on a carrier which moves into the forming device. An impress preforming device allows the carrier with the deposited polymer to be shaped in the mold or forming device. Alternatively, the transfer device can be connected with a chamber which is capable of coating continuous or chopped fibers which are deposited on a carrier in a continuous or chopped manner. The carrier with the fiber and polymer composite layer are shaped in the forming device.
