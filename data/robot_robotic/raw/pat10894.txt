A vehicle automatic fueling assembly having an automatic teller-type control command center which is energized by insertion of money or credit card by the vehicle driver from within the vehicle to select and pay for the amount of fuel desired. A computer control assembly is provided in operative command control engagement with the automatic teller-type command center so as to selectively actuate a robot controlled fueling assembly having an automatic cut-off fueling nozzle assembly into mating fueling engagement with an automatic cut-off fuel receiving valve assembly provided in associated with the modified gasoline tank of a vehicle. The vehicle automatic fuel assembly is also provided with wheel stop lock means and windshield cleaning and drying means which are also automatically controlled by the computer control assembly. The modified gas tank is provided with a gasoline tank closure door assembly which is selectively actuated to provide fueling access to the fuel receiving valve provided in association therewith.
