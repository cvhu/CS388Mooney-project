An apparatus comprising an electrolyte cell, an anode, and a porous rigid diffuser. The electrolyte cell is configured to receive a substrate to have a metal film deposited thereon. An anode is contained within the electrolyte cell. A porous rigid diffuser is connected to the electrolyte cell and extends across the electrolyte cell. The diffuser is positioned between a location that the substrate is to be positioned when the metal film is deposited thereon and the anode.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An electrochemical plating cell, comprising: a cell body configured to contain a plating solution and having an open upper portion configured to receive a substrate for plating; an anode positioned in the cell body; and a substantially rigid diffusion member positioned across the cell body between the anode and the open upper portion, wherein the diffusion member has a substantially uniform thickness and is made form a porous material, wherein the porous material has pores having a diameter of between about 0.1 microns and about 500 microns, and wherein the diffusion member comprises a plurality of spherically shaped ceramic particles that occupy between about 40% and 80% of a volume of the diffusion member, and wherein the pores are formed with a gradient across a width of the diffusion member, the gradient of pores being configured to compensate for non-uniformities in fluid flow through the diffusion member. 2. An electrochemical plating cell, comprising: a cell body configured to contain a plating solution therein; an anode positioned in the cell body; a rigid diffusion member positioned across the cell body above the anode, wherein the diffusion member has a substantially uniform thickness and is made from a porous material, wherein the diffusion member is configured to generate a substantially uniform vertical flow of fluid therethrough; and a membrane positioned across the cell body above the anode and below the diffusion member.
