A method to autonomously determine a destination in navigation system is disclosed. The system is preconfigured with all the routes that a vehicle takes. The system constantly checks if the vehicle takes known routes. After finding out that the vehicle has been taken a known route, a final destination is determined.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method to autonomously determine a destination of a vehicle employing a GPS-based navigation system comprising: a one-time configuration process and a destination determination process, said one-time configuration process comprising: (a) inputting one or more routes to be autonomously determined in said system, each route including a starting point and an end point, by entering said starting point and said end point in said GPS-based navigation system; (b) displaying said route through a map with a series of decision points; (c) manually selecting a subset of said decision points as close to the starting point as possible to identify a vehicle's movement; (d) ordering said subset of said decision points; (e) storing said ordered subset and said end point as a pattern key for said route, said pattern key uniquely identify said route from said starting point to said end point; (f) repeating (a)-(e) for inputting each route to be autonomously determined; said destination determination process comprising: (g) continuously comparing a vehicle's current location with each ordered decision point of each pattern key based on said GPS-based navigation system; (h) if said vehicle's location matches with said decision points of one or more pattern keys, checking if said vehicle passed through all decision points of said pattern keys; (i) if said vehicle passed through all decision points of a pattern key in said defined order, said end point of said pattern key is dynamically predicted as said vehicle's destination; and (j) returning to step (g). 2. The method according to claim 1 further comprising: (k) displaying said route through a list with said series of decision points.
