This invention includes methods and systems for processing hydrogel biomedical devices, such as ophthalmic lenses using polyethylene glycol to facilitate release of the devices from a mold part.
Claims What is claimed: 1. An ophthalmic lens formed from a reaction mixture comprising: a high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer; an effective amount of an hydroxyl-functionalized silicone-containing monomer; and an amount of polyethylene glycol effective to facilitate release of the lens from a mold part in which the device is formed, wherein the polyethylene glycol comprises one or more of: PEG 2000, mPEG and PEG DME. 2. The ophthalmic lens of claim 1 wherein the amount of said polyethylene glycol effective to facilitate release of the lens from a mold part in which the lens is formed comprises between 0.005 to 10 weight %. 3. The ophthalmic lens of claim 1 wherein the amount of said polyethylene glycol effective to facilitate release of the lens from a mold part in which the lens is formed comprises between 0.05 to 5 weight %. 4. The ophthalmic lens of claim 1 wherein the amount of said polyethylene glycol effective to facilitate release of the lens from a mold part in which the lens is formed comprises between 0.01 to 3 weight %. 5. The ophthalmic lens of claim 1 wherein the ophthalmic lens is a silicone hydrogel contact lens. 6. The ophthalmic lens of claim 1 wherein the polyethylene glycol comprises PEG 2000. 7. The ophthalmic lens of claim 2 wherein the polyethylene glycol comprises mPEG. 8. The ophthalmic lens of claim 2 wherein the polyethylene glycol comprises PEG DME.
