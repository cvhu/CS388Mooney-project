A circuit breaker panelboard modular assembly employs a plurality of interdependent molded plastic and metal parts to multifunctionally adapt breakers of different ratings for electrical connection within the panelboard enclosure. Anti-turn connector connects the line strap terminal. Captive bolts or plug-in connections are employed to attach the breakers to the power bus. A novel concealed hinge construction is used to connect the panelboard door to the panelboard housing and the breakers are individually identified within the housing by extruded plastic circuit markers.
Claims Having described our invention, what we claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent is: 1. A circuit breaker panelboard assembly comprising: closure means housing at least one main circuit breaker and a plurality of branch circuit breakers; access means movably arranged on said closure means for providing access to said main and said branch circuit breakers from outside of said closure means; mounting means within said closure supporting said branch circuit breakers and providing electrical connection between said branch circuit breakers and electrical bus bars within said closure means and connectable with an external circuit; and shield means intermediate said access means and said main and branch circuit breakers preventing contact with electrical terminals on said main and branch circuit breakers; said shield means further including a plurality of marking means carrying indicia to identify each of said branch circuit breakers, said marking means comprising plastic clips, each clip attached to opposing surfaces of said shield means. 2. The circuit breaker panelboard assembly of claim 1 wherein each of said plastic clips consists of a bight portion and two depending legs, said legs toeing in toward each other to tightly engage said shield surface.
