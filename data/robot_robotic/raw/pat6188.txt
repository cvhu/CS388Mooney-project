A metal detector system including a chassis for supporting electromagnetic sensor components above a medium such as soil or water. A transmitter coil and two receiver coils are attached to the chassis. A propulsion system is attached to the chassis between or adjacent to the receiver coils. The location of the propulsion system causes electromagnetic interference signals emanating from the propulsion system to be received at a nominally equal magnitude by each of the receiver coils.
