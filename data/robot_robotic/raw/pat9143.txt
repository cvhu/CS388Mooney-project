An overload release apparatus for a robot supports a cutting tool such as an abrasive grinding wheel. A force sensor detects an amount of force applied to the cutting tool by a workpiece while a force release mechanism reduces the force applied to the cutting tool. The force release mechanism includes an electromagnet secured within a housing, a follower disposed within the housing which is allowed to move both linearly and angularly, and an elastic element interposed between an upper wall of the housing and the follower. During normal operation, the follower maintains contact with and is supported by a shoulder formed on an inner circumferential wall of the housing by an attractive force of an electromagnet. When a cutting tool, such as an abrasive cutting wheel, engages with an irregularity on a workpiece, an axial force and a moment are applied to the follower causing the follower to move both linearly and angularly inside the housing. The follower and the housing maintain contact through engagement between a toroidal shaped circular protrusion, formed on the follower, and a cylindrical surface disposed about a hole in the housing. Vibrations transmitted from the cutting tool to the follower are received by an elastic vibration damping medium which is interposed between the follower and the housing to thereby absorb high frequency vibrations.
