A method and apparatus for image acquisition utilizing a non-planar beam of electro-magnetic radiation, such as, a hollow conical beam of light, to illuminate at least a portion of an object. The conical beam of light is generated by impinging a light beam on the surface of a concave, cylindrical reflector. The light beam enters the concave cylindrical reflector through the hollow shaft of a motor. The illuminated portion of the object is imaged on an array of photosensitive elements to produce corresponding signals that are representative of the image on the array. These signals can be used to obtain identification information concerning the object and guidance information for a plural axis manipulator employed in conjunction with the object. In one application the image acquisition apparatus is used in a robot to provide control signals for guiding the robot tool along a path, such as, a welding seam.
