An array of triboelectric sensors is used for testing the electrostatic properties of a remote environment. The sensors may be mounted in the heel of a robot arm scoop. To determine the triboelectric properties of a planet surface, the robot arm scoop may be rubbed on the soil of the planet and the triboelectrically developed charge measured. By having an array of sensors, different insulating materials may be measured simultaneously. The insulating materials may be selected so their triboelectric properties cover a desired range. By mounting the sensor on a robot arm scoop, the measurements can be obtained during an unmanned mission.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of determining the triboelectric properties of a material comprising: selecting a plurality of insulators; simultaneously rubbing the plurality of insulators against the material; measuring a change in a magnitude and polarity of an electrical charge on each of a plurality of the insulators over time; and determining a triboelectric property of the material in response to results from said measuring. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising lifting the plurality of insulators from the material. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the change in electrical charge is stored in a capacitor. 4. The method of claim 3, further comprising discharging the capacitor prior to the rubbing step. 5. The method of claim 4, wherein the capacitor is discharged using a switch. 6. The method of claim 5, wherein the switch is a low-leakage solid state switch.
