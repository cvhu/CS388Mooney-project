The method comprises the steps of first extracting an image of a partial shape from a two-dimensional picture image representing at least one portion of the object article whose position and orientation are to be recognized, then calculating at least one of a center of gravity, an intersection of straight lines and a linear equation with respect to each of the extracted feature shapes, thereby obtaining at least one feature parameter, and calculating the position and orientation of the whole object article by arbitrarily combining such feature parameters.
