An alignment system includes two or more alignment devices arranged in close proximity and sharing a common processing device. The alignment devices are located adjacent to one another, yet while one substrate is being processed, a second substrate can be prepared for processing without affecting or interfering with the first substrate, thereby resulting in greater utilization of the process resource.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A substrate processing system, comprising: a process module having at least two alignment devices in close proximity; and a marking device located adjacent to the two alignment devices such that the marking device has a processing zone which overlaps a substrate located at each of the alignment devices. 2. The substrate processing system of claim 1, wherein the marking device can mark a substrate on each of the at least two alignment devices without incurring a positional shift. 3. The substrate processing system of claim 1, further comprising: a sensing system for sensing the orientation and position of the substrate in the alignment device. 4. The substrate processing system of claim 3, further comprising: means for adjusting each of at least two substrates in the alignment devices, the adjustment in accordance with information provided by said sensing system to achieve alignment between the substrates and the marking device. 5. The substrate processing system of claim 1, wherein the marking device produces a marking beam which can reach any location within the processing zone. 6. The alignment system according to claim 5, wherein the marking device includes at least one mirror for directing the marking beam.
