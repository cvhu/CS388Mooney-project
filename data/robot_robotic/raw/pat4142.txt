This invention relates to process sequence by high-speed atomic layer chemical vapor processing that includes deposition for diffusion barriers in the etched features on substrate followed by gap fill and subsequent in-situ removal of the blanket films on the top by plasma enhanced vapor phase processes. The apparatus and process sequences employed in these processing scheme allows the practitioner to complete all vapor phase process sequences of diffusion barrier deposition, gap fill and planarization of copper and diffusion barrier planarization. In case of copper metallization scheme, vapor phase gap fill can be employed to replace electrochemical deposition of copper and removal of copper and the diffusion barrier by vapor phase reactions can replace chemical-mechanical-polishing. Furthermore, such a processing scheme can be employed to deposit gate level dielectric layer, shallow trench isolation and also to form first metal contact plugs with a suitable barrier at the front end of line processing.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of filling a recess in the surface of an object comprising the steps of: providing a plasma enhanced monolayer processing apparatus having a working chamber, at least a first chemical supply unit for the supply of a first chemical agent and a second chemical supply unit for the supply of a second chemical agent into said working chamber, said first chemical agent and said second chemical agent reacting with each other to produce a deposition material; placing said object with top surface and recess into said plasma enhanced monolayer processing apparatus; said recess having side walls surface and bottom surface; supplying said first chemical agent and said second chemical agent to said working chamber; causing a reaction between said first chemical agent and said second chemical agent for producing reaction products that contains said deposition material; wherein the rate of deposition of said material on said bottom surface of said recess and said top surface of said substrate is higher than the rate of deposition of said material on said side walls surface of said recess; evacuating said working chamber for removing said reaction products except said deposition material; depositing said deposition material into said recess by a process selected from plasma enhanced monolayer deposition and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition for decomposing at least one of said first chemical agent and said second chemical agent in order to deposit said deposition material in the form of a deposited layer of varying thickness onto said surfaces and into said recess; filling said recess by a process selected from plasma enhanced monolayer deposition and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; continuously depositing said deposition material by said plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and by repeating said step of depositing said deposition material by said plasma enhanced monolayer deposition process until said recess is completely filled, said deposited layer on said top surface having a thickness being greater than the half of said width of said recess.
