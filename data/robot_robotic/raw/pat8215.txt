Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Integrin-linked kinase. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Integrin-linked kinase. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Integrin-linked kinase expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Integrin-linked kinase are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 1-120 of the 5' UTR region nucleobases 171-1507 of the coding region, the 3'UTR region, or the stop codon of a nucleic acid molecule encoding human Integrin-linked kinase (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human Integrin-linked kinase. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 or 89. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of Integrin-linked kinase in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of Integrin-linked kinase is inhibited.
