An end-of-arm tooling device for a robot or like manipulator is provided which, in a preferred embodiment, includes a differential separating a first torsional input into first and second torsional outputs, and two jaws for interacting with a workpiece powered by a separate one of the first and second torsional outputs, and wherein, upon interaction with the workpiece at a predetermined torque level by one of the jaws, the jaw's motion will be stopped and torque will be continually transferred to the remaining jaw.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. An end-of-arm tooling device for a robot for interacting with a workpiece comprising: power means providing a first torsional input; at least one input shaft powered by the power means; a cross shaft connected to the input shaft, the cross shaft having rotatably attached thereto first and second bevel planet gears; a first bevel output sun gear concentrically fitted over the input shaft meshed with the first and second bevel planet gears; a second bevel output sun gear concentrically fitted over the input shaft meshed with the first and second bevel planet gears; a first jaw means torsionally associated with the first bevel output sun gear to interact with the workpiece; and a second jaw means torsionally associated with the second bevel output sun gear to interact with the workpiece.
