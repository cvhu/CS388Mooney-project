A method to automatically align internal splines (20) of a torque converter (16) to mating external splines (18) of a transmission subassembly (14) during the assembly of the torque converter (16) to the transmission subassembly (14). The apparatus includes a robotic end effector assembly (26) coupled to an arm (22) of a robot (24). The end effector assembly (26) includes a counterbalance mechanism, such as spring assemblies (62) and a position sensor (64) that provide for a reduced effective weight of the torque converter (10) to allow the splines to align and detect if the splines are not properly aligned. Upon sensing non-engagement, robot (24) lifts, rotates and lowers the torque converter (16) until the position sensor (64) detects alignment of the mating splines.
Claims I claim: 1. An automated method of aligning splines of a torque converter with splines of a vehicle automatic transmission subassembly while assembling the torque converter to the transmission subassembly using an end effector assembly connected to an arm of a robot, the method comprising the steps of: positioning the transmission subassembly with the splines extending upwards in a substantially vertical direction; engaging the torque converter with the end effector assembly; positioning the torque converter over the transmission subassembly with the splines of the torque converter substantially centered over the splines of the transmission subassembly; providing a counterbalance mechanism in the end effector assembly such that a limited amount of relative movement can occur between the robot arm and the torque converter and the torque converter is resiliently supported relative to the robot arm; said counterbalance mechanism including spring assemblies providing sensing means such that the sensing means detects relative vertical position between the robot arm and torque converter; lowering the torque converter down onto the transmission subassembly until the sensing means detects a vertical change in relative position between the robot arm and torque converter; lifting the torque converter, rotating the torque converter and lowering the torque converter if the robot arm has not dropped a predetermined distance indicating full seating of the torque converter on the transmission subassembly until the sensing means detects a vertical change in relative position between the robot arm and torque converter; and repeating the lowering step and the lifting, rotating and lowering step until the robot arm has dropped the predetermined distance indicating a full seating of the torque converter. 2. A method according to claim 1 further including the steps of: providing a pre-alignment tool assembly having alignment tools with diameters and lengths generally matching that of the torque converter splines; and inserting the pre-alignment tool assembly to align said torque converter splines and removing it from the torque converter splines whereby the torque converter splines are generally aligned with the transmission subassembly splines prior to lowering the torque converter.
