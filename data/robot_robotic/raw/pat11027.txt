A part feeder (29) for moving individual parts (34) held on rolls (21) of tape (37) to a pickup point, as for handling by a robot arm (25) inserting parts (34) into PC boards (26) at a work station, the part feeder (29) including a cassette (30) having a housing portion (30a) to hold the roll (21) and side walls (85) having guide members (48,33,104) affixed to position the parts (34) for capture by a parts advancing mechanism (52) to be transferred into a part dressing assembly (43) where the parts (34) have their leads (35,36) straightened and cut to a desired length preparatory to presentation for pickup. (FIG. 7).
Claims I claim: 1. A part feeder (29) for moving individual parts (34,100) from a roll (21) containing a plurality of parts (34,100) formed of a component plus leads (35,36,100a) and joined by at least one tape (37,101) said parts (34,100) secured to said at least one tape (37,101) at a spaced distance therebetween, said parts (34,100) positioned by said part feeder (29) to be picked up and thereafter moved to a work station for insertion of a portion (35,36,100a) of the part (34,100) into a receiving opening (27) in a workpiece (26), said part feeder (29) comprising: a table (32) adapted to support at least one part feeder (29), a cassette (30) adapted to be detachably secured to said table (32) including a housing portion (30a) and a single reel (38) received in said housing portion (30a), means rotatably holding the reel to allow a tape roll (21) placed on the reel (38) to unroll and present the parts (34,100) in single file order; said cassette (30) further including walls (85) extending away from said housing portion (30a); guide means (48,33,104) affixed to said cassette walls (85) comprising means for prepositioning the at least one tape (37) and attached parts (34,100) unwound from said roll (21); a dressing assembly (43,107) separate from said cassette including a frame (83) fixed to said table (32), and readily releasable securement means (85,86,88,89) for readily releasably securing said cassette (30) with respect tos aid frame (83); said dressing assembly (43,107) including parts advancing means (51,52,54,70,109,110,112) at least partially enclosed by said cassette walls to align said guide means (48,33,104) with said parts advancing means so as to capture parts (34,100) prepositioned by said guide means (48,33,104) with said parts advancing means and advance said parts (34,100) one at a time from said guide means, and dressing said part leads (35,36,100a) by straightening and aligning the part leads (35,36,100a) preparatory to pickup. 2. A part feeder (29) as defined in claim 1, wherein said cassette (30) includes at least one handle (90,91) for easy carrying. 3. A part feeder (29) as defined in claim 2, wherein said guide means aligns said parts (100) in a vertical orientation for presentation to said dressing assembly (107) and preparatory to pickup after dressing of said part leads (35,36,100a). 4. A part feeder as defined in claim 2, wherein said guide means aligns said parts (34) in a horizontal orientation for presentation to said dressing assembly and preparatory to pickup after dressing said part leads (35,36,100a). 5. The part feeder (29) according to claim 1 further including cutting means (74,114) for cutting said part leads (35,36,100a) to length and thereby separating said parts (34,100) from said at least one tape (37,101) preparatory to dressing thereof. 6. The part feeder (29) according to claim 5 wherein said cutting means (74,114) is included in said dressing assembly (43,107), and wherein said part advancing means (51,52,70,109,119) engages said at least one tape (37,101) to advance said parts (34,100) into said dressing assembly (43,107). 7. A part feeder (29) as defined in claim 4, wherein said parts advancing means (51,52,54,70,109,110,112) comprises engagement means (52,109) adjacent said cassette for releasably engaging a portion of said at least one tape (37,101) positioned by said cassette guide means, and a first actuator means (70,112) for moving said dressing assembly (43,107) from a first position toward said tape roll (21) on said cassette (30) the distance equal to the spacing between the parts (34,100), a second actuator means (54,110) for actuating said engagement means to engage said at least one tape (37,101), said first actuator means thereafter moving said dressing assembly (43,107) back to said first position while said second actuator means causes said engagement means to be disengaged from said at least one tape (37,101) to thereby advance said at least one tape (37,101) the distance of the space between the parts to be disengaged from said at least one tape (37,101) to thereby advance said at least one tape (37, 101) the distance of the space between parts (34,100) to move another part (34,100) into said dressing assembly (43,107).
