A signal processing method for efficiently searching an optimum solution in a neural network by including a term of a nonlinear resistance in an equation of motion and changing such nonlinear resistance periodically. According to the method, the range of absolute values of connection weights between units in the neural network is limited by the equation of motion, hence preventing a prolonged search time that may otherwise be caused by excessive extension of the search scope beyond the requisite. A plurality of patterns are previously embedded or stored in the neural network and, upon input of a predetermined key pattern, the nonlinear resistance is changed periodically to recall a pattern similar to the key pattern, whereby any desired pattern can be searched or retrieved with rapidity and facility out of the complicated patterns. A process of calculating the next position of an articulated robot corresponding to an optimum solution is repeated while periodically changing a nonlinear resistance included in another equation of the positional energy of the robot, thereby acquiring the data of the robot path up to a desired goal.
