Systems and methods for performing tele-operations with the active assistance and supervision of a cognitive agent, such as a human being, who generates a future path plan in real time for immediate use by an automated on-line controlled agent, such as a work robot or other manipulator, are disclosed. The systems and methods may employ a visual display to present images of the controlled agent, of a foward simulation of the controlled agent, and of the future path plan being generated to enable a human operator to assess and control the on-going activity. The system simultaneously operates the controlled agent and produces the forward simulation and path plan, all under real time conditions. The cognitive agent, display and forward simulation equipment may be at one location and the controlled agent and its controller at another remote location. The forward simulation may be selectively operated in one of three modes: a time-and-position synchronized mode, a position-synchronized, time-desynchronized mode, and a mode where neither time nor position are synchronized with the controlled agent. The desynchronization of time and of position of the forward simulation with respect to the controlled agent is accomplished by use of a time clutch and a position clutch. The forward simulation can also be reversed through the use of a time brake, and the time ratio between the forward simulation time and real time can be adjusted. Finally, a method for transferring active control of functioning autonomously-operated equipment from one cognitive agent to another cognitive agent under real time conditions is disclosed.
