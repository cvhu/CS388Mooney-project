One or several molten materials are extruded at low pressure from one or several continuous plasticizers through central stationary nozzles via individually circumferential flow passages of common distribution spools directly into individual extendable transfer reservoirs. From there, the molten materials are transferred in a continuous cascading manner into secondary transfer reservoirs to be subsequently transferred and condensed within mold cavities into finished molded articles. The central stationary nozzles and stationary primary displacement plugs are grooved with lateral longitudinal melt-flow channels to allow the conveyance of molten materials across intersecting molten material passage ways during the extending movement of the manifold assembly. The molten materials are conveyed through secondary displacement plugs into secondary transfer reservoirs by external cylinders, retracting the manifold assembly on adjustable-length spacer rods in unison against the stationary primary displacement plugs. Compensation rods, built into the stationary distribution plugs regulate the volume relative to each transfer reservoir and can monitor the sequence of different molten material transfers. The cylinder strokes are variable to create finished articles at different weights. Multiple molten materials are united during the tertiary transfer phase by passing across multilayer die crowns and die cones, embedded in tertiary distribution spools of a tertiary manifold assembly.
