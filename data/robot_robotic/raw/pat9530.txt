The teaching procedure is performed so that a relative position of the tool against a workpiece and an attitude of a tool against a ground are maintained constant under a control of a co-acting mode of the manual operation. The position and the attitude of the workpiece and the position and the attitude of the tool are manipulated in response to a co-acting mode signal supplied by a mode changing switch, a robot signal selecting the workpiece handling robot supplied by a robot changing switch and actuating signals supplied by a group of the keys. The manipulation of the position of the tool by the tool handling robot is coordinated with the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the workpiece by the workpiece handling robot maintaining the attitude of the tool against the ground and the relative position of the tool against the workpiece.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A teaching control device for manual operations of an industrial robotic system, the robotic system having a workpiece handling robot for manipulating a position and an attitude of a workpiece and a tool handling robot for manipulating a position and an attitude of a tool processing of said workpiece, said teaching control device comprising: (a) designating means of a sole-action/co-action for supplying a mode signal to designate either (i) a sole-acting mode of the manual operation of said robotic system wherein manipulation of the position and the attitude of the workpiece by said workpiece handling robot are performed independently of the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the tool by said tool handling robot, or (ii) a co-acting mode of the manual operation wherein the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the tool by said tool handling robot are coordinated with an interdependent on the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the workpiece by said workpiece handling robot; (b) selecting means of a handling robot for supplying a robot signal to select either the workpiece handling robot or the tool handling robot; (c) teaching key means for generating actuating signals to change the position and the attitude of said workpiece or the position and the attitude of said tool; (d) control means for controlling the co-acting mode of the manual operations of said robotic system in response to the co-acting signal supplied by said designating means, the robot signal selecting the workpiece handling robot supplied by said selecting means and the actuating signals generated by said teaching key means, said control means comprising a computer for performing the following steps; (i) receiving a co-acting mode signal, robot signal and actuating signals, computing the previous position and the previous attitude of the workpiece in the absolute coordinates system, an attitude of the tool against the ground and a relative position of the tool against the workpiece in response to joint variables of the workpiece handling robot and the joint variables of the tool handling robot obtained just before receiving said actuating signals; (ii) controlling an execution of a calculating step in response to said actuating signals maintained for a preset time interval, controlling a repetition of said computing step in response to new actuating signals when said actuating signals has already changed during said preset time interval or controlling a termination of said co-acting mode of the manual operation in response to an absence of said actuating signals during said preset time interval; (iii) calculating the position and the attitude of said workpiece after a preset time interval in response to said actuating signals and said previous position and previous attitude of the workpiece in the absolute coordinates system obtained by said computing step and calculating the position and the attitude of the tool after a preset time interval in response to said attitude of the tool against the ground obtained by said computing step, said relative position of the tool against the workpiece obtained by said computing step and said position and attitude of the workpiece after a preset time interval; (iv) calculating the joint variables of the workpiece handling robot after a preset time interval in response to said position and attitude of the workpiece after a preset time interval obtained by said calculating step and calculating the joint variables of the tool handling robot after a preset time interval in response to said position and attitude of the tool after a preset time interval obtained by said calculating step; and (v) calculating actuating values for the actuators of the workpiece handling robot in response to said joint variables of the workpiece handling robot after a preset time interval and calculating the actuating values for the actuators of the tool handling robot, and simultaneously and independently supplying control signals of the actuating values for the actuators of the workpiece handling robot and control signals of the actuating values for the actuators of the tool handling robot, and further commanding a repetition of above said steps (i)-(v). 2.
