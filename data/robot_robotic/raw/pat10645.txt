A scanning confocal optical microscope using a Nipkow disc having a plurality of pinholes to project light and an objective lens to receive the light and illuminate points on an object to be viewed. Rotation of the disc scans the points across the object. The object is viewed by viewing the reflected light focused on the pinholes by the objective lens.
Claims We claim: 1. A scanning microscope for viewing an object comprising a scanning disc with a plurality of pinholes arranged in a predetermined pattern; a light source on one side of said disc for illuminating an area of said disc; a first polarizer for polarizing the light which illuminates the disc; an objective lens on the opposite side of said disc for focusing light diffracted by said pinholes onto the object to illuminate a plurality of points on said object; means for mounting said disc with its rotational axis at an angle with respect to the axis of light from said source to said objective lens; means for rotating said disc to scan the points across the object; said objective lens serving to receive light reflected from the object and focus the light on corresponding pinholes; a quarterwave plate disposed to cooperate with said objective lens to intercept the light traveling to and reflected from said object; a beam splitter on said one side of said disc between said first polarizer and said disc for receiving reflected light traveling through said quarterwave plate and said pinholes and directing it; and a polarizer for receiving the directed light.
