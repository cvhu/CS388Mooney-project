A mechanism capable of achieving an arbitrarily specified spatial compliant behavior is presented. The mechanism is a parallel connection of multiple individual elastic components that connect a support body to a single compliantly floated body. Each elastic component is, in itself, a low friction 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) mechanism that provides compliant constraint along and/or about a single axis. The elastic components are of three functional types: 1) a "line spring" which resists only translation along its axis, 2) a "torsional spring" which resists only rotation about its axis, and 3) a "screw spring" which resists a specified combination of translation along and rotation about its axis. Through proper selection of the connection geometry, spring constant, and functional type of each elastic component, a spatial compliant mechanism capable of passive force guidance is realized.
Claims We claim: 1. A spatial parallel compliant mechanism for interconnecting a support body to a floated body, the mechanism comprising: a plurality of passive elastic components connected in parallel between the support body and the floated body, each of the elastic components having a stiffness, a pitch and a longitudinal axis, and at least one of the elastic components being constructed and arranged to transmit force along and torque about its longitudinal axis. 2. The mechanism of claim 1, wherein each elastic component is of a type selected from a group consisting of line springs, torsional springs, and screw springs. 3. The mechanism of claim 1, wherein the elastic components are translational-type screw springs and rotational-type screw springs.
