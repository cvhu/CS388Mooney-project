A tube gripper device includes a one-piece gripper assembly of plastic material having a base portion and a plurality of gripper fingers extending therefrom in spaced apart parallel relation to each other for individual flexing movement relative to the base. A cam member is slidably engageable with each of said fingers and is connected to a solenoid actuator whereby upon energization of the solenoid actuator, the cam member is moveable to spread the fingers apart. A spring is provided for moving the fingers into gripping engagement with a tube upon de-energization of the solenoid actuator.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A tube gripper device comprising a one-piece gripper assembly of plastic material having a base portion, a plurality of gripper fingers extending therefrom in spaced apart parallel relation to each other for individual flexing movement relative to the base portion, solenoid actuator means connected to said base portion and cam means disposed between said fingers and connected to said actuator means for engaging and spreading said fingers apart upon energization of said solenoid actuator means and resilient means disposed in direct continuous engagement with said fingers for returning said fingers to a tube gripping position upon de-energization of said solenoid actuator means. 2. A tube gripper device as set forth in claim 1, wherein each gripper finger is provided with a gripper member having a pad thereon for engaging a tube. 3. A tube gripper device as set forth in claim 1, wherein each gripper finger is provided with a bevelled surface whereby the bevelled surfaces on all of said fingers define a substantially conical surface having a narrow end extending towards said actuator means and wherein said cam means is comprised of a hemispherical cam member disposed in slidable engagement with said bevelled surfaces.
