An automated product selection system for combining packages containing different products in an outbound container as set forth in claim 2 wherein a source transfer station and a destination transfer station are located on each of said stacked storage levels and further comprising a vertical input conveyer for transporting selected ones of said incoming cases to the source transfer station on a selected one of said vertical storage levels. 5. An automated product selection system for combining packages containing different products in an outbound container as set forth in claim 3 further comprising a vertical output conveyer for transporting cases from the destination transfer stations on selected ones of said of said vertical storage levels to said outbound container. 6. An automated product selection system for combining packages containing different products in an outbound container as set forth in claim 1 wherein each of said wheeled transport vehicles includes a steering mechanism responsive to steering commands issued by said programmed processor for controlling the vehicle's direction of movement on said network of roadways. 7. An automated product selection system for combining packages containing different products in an outbound container as set forth in claim 1 further including position sensing means for determining and storing data accessible to said programmed processor indicating the current position of each of said wheeled transport vehicles on said on said network of roadways. 8. An automated materials handling system comprising, in combination, a programmed processor for issuing command signals, a plurality of autonomous wheeled transport vehicles coupled to said processor and responsive to command signals from said programmed processor for transporting a case from a specified origin location to a specified destination location, each of said cases being filled at a remote manufacturing location with item units of the same kind, a warehouse of temporary storage locations positioned on each of a plurality of different vertical levels, each of said levels comprising: at least one input transfer station, at least one output transfer station, a plurality of aisle guideways each of which supports and guides one or more of said wheeled transport vehicles for movement between of a pair of opposing rows of horizontally distributed temporary storage locations, an input interconnecting guideway that supports and guides one or more of said wheeled transport vehicles for movement between said input transfer station and each of said aisle guideways, and an output interconnecting guideway that supports and guides one or more of said wheeled transport vehicles for movement between said output transfer station and each of said aisle guideways, at least one input receiving station for receiving cases transported from remote manufacturing locations to said receiving station on pallets, an input conveyor including a vertical transport mechanism responsive to command signals from said processor for selectively transporting each case received at said at least one input receiving station to an input transfer station positioned on a specified one of said vertical levels, at least one output order assembly station for combining item units ordered by customer into outbound shipments, an output conveyor including a vertical transport mechanism for transporting cases delivered to the output transfer stations on each of said vertical levels to said at least one output order assembly station, said programmed processor being configured to issue one or more command signals to said input conveyer for transporting each given case received at said at least one input receiving station to a specified one of said vertical levels and for issuing one or more command signals to a designated one of said wheeled vehicles to transport said given case via said input interconnecting guideway on said specified one of said levels and a specified one of said aisle guideways on said specified one of said levels to a specified one of said temporary storage locations, and for transferring said given case from said wheeled vehicle to said specified one of storage locations, said programmed processor being further configured to issue command signals to a particular one of said wheeled vehicles to retrieve and transport a particular case from a particular one of said temporary storage locations on a particular one of said levels to an output transfer station on said particular one of said levels from which said particular case is transported via said output conveyor to said output order assembly station and included in said outbound shipment. 9. An automated materials handling system as set forth in claim 8 wherein said input interconnecting guideway on each of said vertical levels includes branching roadways at branching locations and wherein each of said wheeled transport vehicles includes a steering mechanism responsive to a command signal from said programmed processor for following a selected one of said branching roadways when one of said branching locations is encountered in said input interconnecting guideway. 10. An automated materials handling system as set forth in claim 8 wherein said programmed processor includes a memory for storing data accessible to said programmed processor indicating the current position of each of said wheeled transport vehicles on said network of roadways. 11.
