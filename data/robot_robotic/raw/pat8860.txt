A robot assembly (10) for opening and holding an automotive door including a base (12) movably mounted to a platform (14). An inner robot arm (18) is pivotally mounted to the base. An outer robot arm (20) is pivotally mounted to the inner arm (18). A tool arm (22) is pivotally mounted to the outer robot arm (20). The tool arm (22) includes a shaft (58) presenting a second tool arm axis (A.sub.4) for rotation about the second tool arm axis (A.sub.4). A sphere (90), presenting first, second and third sphere axes (A.sub.5,A.sub.6,A.sub.7), is mounted to the distal end of the shaft (58) for rotatably supporting a magnet tool (118). A pin (104) extends from the sphere (90) for preventing the rotation of the tool (118) about the first sphere axis (A.sub.) which is parallel to the second tool arm axis (A.sub.4). The tool (118) is positioned in a home position relative to the second tool arm axis (A.sub.4) by a biasing spring (70) operatively connected to the shaft (58). The tool (118) is positioned in a normal position relative to the second sphere axis (A.sub.6) by a pair of biasing springs (110) engaged with the pin (104). The robot arms (18, 20) maneuver the tool (118) such that the tool (118) engages and opens the door. As the tool (118) engages and opens the door, the tool (118) rotates about the second tool arm axis (A.sub.4), the second sphere axis (As, and the third sphere axis (A.sub.7). The sphere (90) is sealed by a sealing means (112, 114) which accommodates for the rotation of the tool (118). A proximity sensor (74) detects if the tool (118) has hold of the door. The tool arm (22) includes a clutch plate (24) for allowing the tool arm (22) to breakaway from the outer robot arm (20) in the event the tool (118) unexpectedly crashes.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot assembly (10) comprising: a platform (14); a base (12) movably mounted to said platform; an inner robot arm (18) pivotally mounted to said base (12) for movement about an inner arm axis (A.sub.1); an outer robot arm (20) pivotally mounted to said inner arm (18) for movement about an outer arm axis (A.sub.2); a tool arm (22) pivotally mounted to said outer robot arm (20) for movement about a first tool arm axis (A.sub.3); said tool arm (22) including a support housing (46) and a shaft (58) presenting a second tool arm axis (A.sub.4), said shaft (58) being rotatably supported by said support housing (46) for rotation about said second tool arm axis (A.sub.4); a tool support member (92) mounted to said shaft (58); a socket (98) and a sphere (90) disposed in said socket (98) interconnecting said shaft (58) and said tool support member (92) for rotatably supporting said tool support member (92); and a cavity (102) and a pin (104) disposed in said cavity (102) interconnecting said shaft (58) and said tool support member (92) for preventing the rotation of said tool support member (92) about said sphere (90) parallel to said second tool arm axis (A.sub.4). 2. An assembly as set forth in claim 1 including a biasing spring (110) engaged between said tool support member (92) and said pin (104) for placing said tool support member (92) in a normal position with respect to said pin (104). 3. An assembly as set forth in claim 2 including a pair of said biasing springs (110), said springs (110) being located on opposite sides of said sphere (90). 4. An assembly as set forth in claim 2 including a sealing means (112, 114, 116) for sealing an opening extending from said socket (98). 5. An assembly as set forth in claim 4 wherein said sealing means (112, 114, 116) includes a washer (112) above and adjacent to said socket (98) and a seal (114) above and adjacent to said washer (112). 6. An assembly as set forth in claim 5 including a spring (116) disposed in said seal (114) for applying a force to said washer (112). 7. An assembly as set forth in claim 6 wherein said cavity (102) extends from opposite sides of said socket (98) and said pin (104) extends from opposite sides of said sphere (90). 8. An assembly as set forth in claim 7 wherein said tool support member (92) includes said socket (98) and said shaft (58) includes said sphere (90). 9. An assembly as set forth in claim 8 wherein said shaft (58) extends into said opening. 10. An assembly as set forth in claim 1 including a clevis mounted to said shaft (58) and a biasing spring operatively connected to said clevis and said support housing (46) for placing said tool support member (92) in a home position with respect to said second tool arm axis (A.sub.4). 11. An assembly as set forth in claim 10 including a stop rod mounted to said support housing (46) for engaging said clevis for preventing said shaft (58) from rotating beyond a maximum angular rotation with respect to said home position. 12. An assembly as set forth in claim 1 including a proximity tab extending from said shaft (58) and a proximity sensor for detecting the presence of said tab for providing a signal when said tool support member (92) has rotated about said second tool arm axis (A.sub.4) a specified angular rotation with respect to said home position. 13. An assembly as set forth in claim 1 wherein said tool arm (22) includes a clutch plate (24) detachably mounted to said outer robot arm (20) for disconnecting said tool arm (22) from said outer robot arm (20) when said tool arm (22) is subjected to excessive loading. 14. An assembly as set forth in claim 13 including multiple screws (30) for detachably mounting said clutch plate (24) to said outer robot arm (20), whereby said screws (30) fail when said tool arm (22) is subjected to excessive loading. 15.
