The present invention relates to an automatic running control apparatus of a robot and a method thereof by which a fuzzy logic rule is performed utilizing data on a running direction, a running distance and an obstacle when a self-propelled mobile robot runs along a rectilinear distance, so that the robot can avoid the obstacle in the running direction, and at the same time, the robot can run accurately to a target point maintaining a predetermined running speed.

The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of decreasing left and right motor speeds when it is determined that the running speed of the robot is fast relative to the reference speed. 6. The method of claim 3, further comprising a step of determining a weighted rectilinear running correction value if the obstacle is not located within the avoidance domain; and wherein the step of determining whether a running speed of the robot is fast, slow, or normal is performed after determination of the weighted rectilinear running correction value, when a running direction of the robot is normal. 7. The method of claim 3, further comprising the steps of: increasing a left motor speed and decreasing a right motor speed when the running direction of the robot is to the left of a desired direction; and increasing the right motor speed and decreasing the left motor speed when the running direction of the robot is to the right of a desired direction.
