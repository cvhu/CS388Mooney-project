A communication apparatus for robots is provided. A controller and drivers controlling each joint are serially connected to a serial transmission line. A final driver positioned at the last stage, among the drivers, is connected to an I/O module connected to a driver of a hand. When control signals for each driver and the driver of the hand are serially transmitted from the controller to the serial transmission line, the driver connected to the I/O module receives a control signal for the driver itself and a control signal for the driver of the hand, among the serially transmitted control signals, and transmits the control signal for the driver of the hand to the I/O module.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot comprising: an articulated arm including a plurality of links movably joined respectively by a plurality of joints; a plurality of first drive sources that drives the joints respectively; a plurality of joint control devices that control drive operations of the plurality of first drive sources, respectively; a hand driven by a second drive source; a hand control device that controls drive operations of the second drive sources; a controller that controls operations of the joints and the hand by providing the joint control devices and the hand control device with control signals; a serial transmission path connecting the controller and the joint control devices so that signals including the control signals are communicated in series through the serial transmission path; an input and output device communicably connected to the hand control device and communicably connected to a designated joint control device among the joint control devices; command producing means, implemented in the controller, for producing the control signals including commands to drive the first and second drive sources, the control signals having a same format; requesting means, implemented in the controller, for repeatedly issuing a request for position signals showing current operating positions of the first drive sources and the second drive source for producing the control signal; transmission means, implemented in the controller, for repeatedly transmitting the control signals in series and the request for the position signals to the joint control devices through the serial transmission path; reception means, implemented in the controller, for repeatedly receiving the position signals in series through the serial transmission path; first communication means, implemented in each of remaining one or more joint control devices other than the designated joint control device in the joint control devices, for communicating the control signals and the position signals by receiving the control signals and transmitting the positions signals between each of the remaining one or more control devices and the controller via the serial transmission path; and second communication means, implemented in the designated joint control device, for communicating the control signals and the position signals to the designated joint control device, the hand control device, and the controller by receiving the control signals and transmitting the positions signals, respectively, to and from both the designated joint control device and the hand control device the serial transmission path, wherein the second communication means includes reception means for receiving the control signals directed to both the designated joint control device and the hand control device, providing means for providing the hand control device with a received control signal, detection means for detecting the position signal showing the current operating position of both the first drive source for the designated joint control device and the second drive source, and position-signal transmitting means for transmitting the detected position signals to the controller via the serial transmission path, the reception means and the providing means being operative in response to the reception of the control signal for the designated joint control device, the detection means and the position-signal transmitting means being operative in response to reception of the request from the controller. 2. The robot of claim 1, wherein the first drive sources are servo motors each provided with a rotary encoder to detect a current rotation position of each servo motor, the position signal being an output signal of each of the rotary encoders. 3. The robot of claim 1, wherein the designated joint control device is a joint control device assigned to a last link of the plurality of links of the articulated arm. 4. The robot of claim 1, wherein the last link is a flange of the articulated arm. 5. The robot of claim 1, wherein the designated joint control device is a joint control device assigned to a wrist that movably holds the flange, the wrist being one of the links.
