A system for performing minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The system includes a pair of surgical instruments that are coupled to a pair of robotic arms. The instruments have end effectors that can be manipulated to hold and suture tissue. The robotic arms are coupled to pair of master handles by a controller. The handles can be moved by the surgeon to produce a corresponding movement of the end effectors. The controller controls and limits movement of robotic arms relative to the patient.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A medical robotic system, comprising: a robotic arm; a surgical instrument coupled to said robotic arm; an input device, and a controller that receives input from said input device and computes an output to move said robotic arm, said controller controls movement of said robotic arm and issues a warning if a movement of a pivot point of the surgical instrument exceeds a threshold value. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein said input device includes a handle. 3. The system of claim 1, wherein said controller limits movement of said robot arm when the movement of the pivot point of the surgical instrument exceeds the threshold value. 4. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller computes the movement of the pivot point of the surgical instrument.
