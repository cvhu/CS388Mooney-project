A method to automatically align the internal splines (20) of a torque converter (16) to mating external splines (18) of a transmission subassembly (14) during the assembly of the torque converter (16) to the transmission subassembly (14). The apparatus includes a robotic end effector assembly (26) coupled to an arm (22) of a robot (24). The end effector assembly (26) includes a compliance mechanism (51) and a distance sensor (48) that provide for compliance to allow the splines to align and detect if the splines are not properly mating. The end effector assembly (26) also includes an oscillator assembly (69) that is activated to cause non-aligned splines to become aligned during the automated assembly process.
Claims We claim: 1. An automated method of aligning splines of a torque converter with splines of a vehicle automatic transmission subassembly while assembling the torque converter to the transmission subassembly using an end effector assembly connected to an arm of a robot, the method comprising the steps of: positioning the transmission subassembly with the splines extending upwards in a substantially vertical direction; engaging the torque converter with the end effector assembly; positioning the torque converter over the transmission subassembly with the splines of the torque converter substantially centered over the splines of the transmission subassembly; providing a compliance mechanism in the end effector assembly such that a limited amount of relative movement can occur between the robot arm and the torque converter; providing sensing means coupled to the compliance mechanism such that the sensing means detects relative vertical position between the robot arm and torque converter; providing an oscillator assembly in the end effector assembly such that the torque converter can be turned back-and-forth relative to the robot arm; lowering the torque converter down onto the transmission subassembly until the sensing means detects a vertical change in relative position between the robot arm and torque converter; activating the oscillator if the robot arm has not dropped a predetermined distance associated with full seating of the torque converter on the transmission subassembly; detecting a vertical change in relative position between the robot arm and the torque converter; repeating the lowering step until the robot arm has dropped the predetermined distance indicating a full seating of the torque converter; and deactivating the oscillator. 2. A method according to claim 1 further including the steps of: providing a pre-alignment tool assembly having alignment tools with diameters and length generally matching that of the torque converter splines; and inserting the pre-alignment tool assembly into and removing it from the torque converter splines, whereby the torque converter splines will be generally radially aligned with the transmission subassembly splines, prior to performing the lowering the torque converter step.
