An apparatus and method for detecting anomalies in ferrous pipe structures is presented. An electrical current is passed through the ferrous pipe structure so as to create a magnetic field in the pipe. A sensor having one or more sensor shoe members is placed in the interior of a ferrous pipe structure to be inspected. Each sensor shoe member has one or more magnetometer elements for detecting the magnetic fields in the region of the ferrous pipe structure adjacent to which the sensor shoe member is placed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure, comprising: sensor means for positioning within and movement along an interior of the ferrous pipe structure; means operably associated with the sensor means for imposing one or more magnetic fields into the ferrous pipe structure, the means for imposing one or more magnetic fields being operably disposed substantially externally to the pipe structure, and including means for applying an electrical current directly to the pipe structure, so as to create a magnetic field in the ferrous pipe structure, said means for imposing one or more magnetic fields including means for imposing a first magnetic field, from an external source, onto the ferrous pipe structure and means for imposing a second magnetic field of reversed polarity relative to the first magnetic field, from an external source, onto the ferrous pipe structure; means operably associated with the sensor means for detecting magnetic fields emanating from the ferrous pipe structure, whether due to remnant induction in the ferrous pipe structure or to magnetic fields imposed by the means to impose magnetic fields; means for generating data signals corresponding to the magnetic fields detected by the means to detect magnetic fields; control means for receiving and processing the data signals generated by the sensor means, and for converting the data signals into information from which a user may determine the presence and characteristics of anomalies in the ferrous pipe structure, including means for simultaneously measuring any magnetic fields emanating from the ferrous pipe structure as a result of an imposition of a magnetic field from the means for imposing a first magnetic field, from an external source, onto the ferrous pipe structure and means for simultaneously measuring any magnetic fields emanating from the ferrous pipe structure as a result of an imposition of a magnetic field from the means for imposing a second first magnetic field, from an external source, onto the ferrous pipe structure and means for comparing the remnant magnetic field measured with the magnetic fields measured after imposition of first and second magnetic fields to yield data representative of anomalies in the ferrous pipe structure at the desired location; means for communicating the data signals generated by the sensor means to the control means; and means for propelling the sensor means along the interior of the ferrous pipe structure. 2. The apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure according to claim 1, wherein the sensor means comprises: a sensor support frame; at least one sensor shoe member, operably configured to be placed adjacent to an interior surface of the ferrous pipe structure; and means for operably positioning the at least one sensor shoe member adjacent to the interior surface of the ferrous pipe structure. 3. The apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure according to claim 2 wherein the means for detecting magnetic fields emanating from the ferrous pipe structure comprises: a magnetometer operably disposed in the sensor shoe member, so as to detect magnetic fields emanating from the ferrous pipe structure. 4. The apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure according to claim 1, wherein the means for communicating the data signals generated by the sensor means to the control means comprises: a hardwire connection from the sensor means to the control means. 5. The apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure according to claim 1, wherein the means for communicating the data signals generated by the sensor means to the control means comprises: telemetry means operably associated with the sensor means and the control means for transmitting the data signals from the sensor means to the control means without a hardwire connection therebetween. 6. The apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure according to claim 1, wherein the means for communicating the data signals generated by the sensor means to the control means comprises: means for recording the data signals generated by the sensor means, for playback into the control means after retrieval of the sensor means from the interior of the ferrous pipe structure.
