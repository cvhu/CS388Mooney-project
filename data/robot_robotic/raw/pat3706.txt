Methods and apparatus for controllably dispensing photoresist solutions and other fluids in semiconductor manufacturing equipment from an array of syringe-based fluid dispensers. A multi-syringe fluid dispensing system is provided for photoresist coating within a wafer track coating module. The coating module may contain a spin chuck that is positioned within a catch cup. A robotic dispense arm and gripper assembly may be positioned within the coating module for gripping and positioning a fluid syringe. An array of syringes may be stored on a solution tray within the wafer track coating module for holding a plurality of fluid syringes containing photoresist solutions.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for dispensing a photoresist solution, comprising: selecting a coating module within a wafer track system that includes: a dispense arm to support a gripper for engaging and actuating a fluid syringe; storing the fluid syringe that contains the photoresist solution within the coating module; instructing the dispense arm and the gripper to select and removably engage the fluid syringe; directing the dispense arm with the gripper and the fluid syringe to a predetermined location over a semiconductor wafer; actuating the fluid syringe to dispense the entire photoresist solution contained therein onto the semiconductor wafer; and disposing of the fluid syringe. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the dispensing the photoresist solution onto the semiconductor wafer is carried out over a substantially center portion the semiconductor wafer as the semiconductor wafer is spinning on a spin chuck. 3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: returning the dispense arm and the gripper to a standby position within the coating module.
