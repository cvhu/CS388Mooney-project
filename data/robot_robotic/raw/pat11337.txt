An automatic centering and gripping apparatus which includes a housing in which is slidably mounted a longitudinally movable operator body. A pair of gripper arms are slidably mounted on the operator body. Each gripper arm carries a gripper member engageable with a workpiece. The gripper members are moved longitudinally and laterally into gripping engagement with a workpiece when the operator body is moved in one longitudinal direction, and they are correspondingly disengaged from the workpiece when the operator body is moved in the other longitudinal direction.

An automatic centering and gripping apparatus as defined in claim 1, characterized in that said housing comprises: (a) a front cover plate; and, (b) a rear cover plate. 3. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 2, characterized in that and comprising, said gripper arm slots each being disposed at an acute angle relative to the longitudinal axes of the housing and operator body, with each gripper arm slot being disposed with its upper end on one side of said longitudinal axes. 4. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 3, characterized in that and comprising, power means for moving said operator body. 5. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, characterized in that it comprises: (a) a housing having a longitudinal and a transverse axis; (b) an operator body, having a longitudinal and a transverse axis, and further having a pair of opposite side faces and a front face and a rear face, slidably mounted in said housing for a longitudinal extension movement to an operative centering and gripping position in said housing, from a retracted inoperative position, and for a longitudinal retraction movement in said housing from said operative centering and gripping position back to said retracted inoperative position, and each of said longitudinal extension and retraction movements including first and second portions thereof; (c) a pair of gripper arms slidably mounted in a pair of angled gripper arm slots which are disposed in a criss-cross manner, and which are formed in said operator body, with one gripper arm slot being formed in the front face of the operator body, and the other gripper arm slot being formed in the rear face of the operator body; (d) said gripper arms each carrying a workpiece gripper member for centering and gripping engagement with a workpiece; (e) cam means for restraining each of said gripper arms against movement relative to the operator body axially of the longitudinal axis of the operator body during mvement of the operator body, through the first portion of said longitudinal extension movement of the operator body, and through the second portion of said longitudinal retraction movement of the operator body, but which permits a combination longitudinal and lateral movement of the gripper amrs relative to the longitudinal axis of said operator body during movement of the operator body, through the second portion of said longitudinal extension movement of the operator body, and through the first portion of said longitudinal retraction movement of the operator body, toward and away from a workpiece whereby the workpiece gripper members carried by the gripper arms are moved along opposing lateral travel paths; (f) means for moving said operator body longitudinally in said housing, whereby when said operator body is moved in said longitudinal extension movement, the workpiece gripper members on the gripper arms are moved along travel paths longitudinally and laterally of the housing and into gripping engagement with a workpiece, and when the operator body is moved in said longitudinal retraction movement, the workpiece gripper members are retracted from the workpiece along the same travel paths; (g) said housing comprising a front cover plate and a rear cover plate; (h) a pair of gripper arm slots, each being disposed at an acute angle relative to the longitudinal axes of the housing and operator body, with each gripper arm slot being disposed with its upper end on one side of said longitudinal axes; (i) power means for moving said operator body; (j) a first cam slot formed in one cover plate and having a longitudinal portion, and a lateral portion communicating with one end of the longitudinal portion, relative to the longitudinal and transverse axes of the apparatus housing, and a slider shoe cam slidably mounted in said first cam slot and being attached to a first one of said gripper amrs; and, (k) a second cam slot formed in the other cover plate and having a longitudinal portion, and a lateral portion communicating with one end of the longitudinal portion, relative to the longitudinal and transverse axes of the apparatus housing, and a slider shoe cam slidably mounted in said second cam slot and being attached to a second one of said gripper arms. 6. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 5, characterized in that and comprising: (a) the lateral portions of the first and second cam slots extending laterally from their respective longitudinal slot portions, in opposite lateral acute angular directions, toward the other ends of their respective longitudinal portions; and, (b) the lateral movements of the gripper arms relative to the longitudinal axis of said operator body toward and away from a workpiece being upon angular paths parallel to the respective first and second cam angular lateral slot portions, so as to move the workpiece gripper members carried by the gripper arms in opposing angular lateral travle paths for gripping engagement with a workpiece. 7. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 6, characterized in that and comprising, workpiece gripper members which comprise rollers. 8. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 7, characterized in that and comprising, an operator body carrying a third workpiece engaging roller for engaging a workpiece at a third point when the rollers on the gripper arms engage a workpiece at two other points, so that the workpiece is engaged at three circumferentially spaced apart points on the workpiece. 9. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 5, characterized in that and comprising: (a) the lateral portions of the first and second cam slots extending transversely from their respective longitudinal slot portions, in opposite transverse rectangular directions, outwardly away from the longitudinal axes of the housing and operator body; and (b) the lateral movements of the gripper arms relative to the longitudinal axis of the housing and operator body, toward and away from a workpiece, being upon paths which are at right angles to the housing and operator body longitudinal axes, so as to move the workpiece gripper members carried by the gripper arms in parallel, transverse travel paths, for gripping engagement with a workpiece at two opposite points. 10. An automatic centering and gripping apparatus, as defined in claim 9, characterized in that and comprising, workpiece gripper members which comprise gripper jaws.
