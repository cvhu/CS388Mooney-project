A system for transferring articles between containers to vary the mix of articles in the containers. A plurality of containers are moved to a mixing station and apparatus including a robot removes selected articles from the containers and places them into other of the containers to provide the desired mix of articles. In the arrangement disclosed, the articles are cups and the system is employed to change the color mix of the cups in the containers.
Claims I claim: 1. Apparatus for transferring articles between a first location and a second location, said apparatus comprising, in combination: robot means including a movable robotic arm; and article engaging means operatively associated with said movable robotic arm and movable therewith for engaging a plurality of articles and transferring the plurality of articles from a first location to a second location, said article engaging means including a fixture attached to said movable robotic arm and movable therewith, a plurality of clamping elements movably connected to said fixture to selectively clamp articles, means for moving said clamping elements relative to said fixture between a clamping position and a non-clamping position, and means for biasing articles clamped by said clamping elements in a direction away from said clamping elements to urge said biased articles out of engagement with said clamping elements when said clamping elements are moved from said clamping position to said non-clamping position by said means for moving said clamping elements, said means for biasing said articles including a plurality of follower elements engageable with said articles, said follower elements being mounted for slidable movement relative to said fixture and operable under the influence of gravity to bias articles clamped by said clamping elements in a direction away from said fixture. 2. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said articles are stacks of cups, each said follower element including a tapered follower head positionable in a stack of cups, said tapered follower heads being cooperable with said stacks of cups to move said stacks of cups to predetermined positions relative to said clamping elements.
