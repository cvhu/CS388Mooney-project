There is described a method and system for developing for an automation process a screen viewable on a target computer that has user interface objects. A development computer has a set of common design time components from a general purpose software development kit that also has a databinding facility and a set of customization components. Those components have an interface that allows access to the available for use automation process data objects and a process object picker that act as a user interface to the databinding facility to allow the browsing of a subset of the available for use data objects and selecting of one or more of the objects in the subset for binding by the databinding facility either to one or more members of the user interface objects or one or more of the user interface objects or a combination of the same.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for developing for an automation process a viewable screen for presenting information, said viewable screen having user interface objects, said automation process having a set of data objects available for use in said system, said system comprising: a processor; a memory storing a set of common design time components from a general purpose software development kit comprising a screen design surface onto which said user interface objects are placed and a databinding facility; and a set of customization components comprising: an automation process object interface that allows access to said available for use automation process data objects, and a process object picker serving as a user interface to said databinding facility to allow: browsing a subset of said available for use automation process data objects, and selecting of one or more of said available for use automation process data objects in said subset for binding by said databinding facility either to one or more of members of said user interface objects, one or more of said user interface objects, or a combination of one or more of said members and one or more of said user interface objects, each of said one or more subset data objects influencing both the appearance and behavior of said screen when so bound; and wherein a data object of said one or more subset data objects of said available for use automation process data objects can be dragged and dropped onto said screen design surface so as to create a corresponding user interface object, said corresponding user interface object automatically bound to said dragged data object when said dragged data object is placed on said screen design surface. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein said set of customization components further comprises an automation process object browser that lists all of said available for use automation process data objects. 3. The system of claim 1 wherein said one or more user interface objects or said one or more members of said user interface objects has a predetermined data type and said subset of said available for use data objects has said predetermined data type. 4. The system of claim 1 wherein said one or more user interface objects or said one or more members of said user interface objects has one data type and said subset of said available for use data objects has another data type, said databinding facility comprising a lookup table of at least two columns such that one of said two columns has said one data type and the other of said two columns has said another data type, said databinding facility using said table to bind one or more of said objects in said subset of said available for use data objects and one or more of said user interface objects or said one or more members of said user interface objects. 5. A computer program product on a non-transitory tangible computer medium for developing for an automation process a viewable screen for presenting information, said viewable screen having user interface objects, said automation process having a set of data objects available for use in said computer program product, said computer program product comprising: computer usable program code configured to provide a set of common design time components from a general purpose software development kit, said common design time components comprising a screen design surface onto which said user interface objects are placed and databinding facility; and computer usable program code configured to provide a set of customization components comprising: computer usable program code configured to provide an automation process object interface that allows access to said available for use automation process data objects, and computer usable program code configured to provide a process object picker serving as a user interface to said databinding facility to allow: browsing a subset of said available for use automation process data objects, and selecting of one or more of said objects in said subset for binding by said databinding facility either to one or more of members of said user interface objects, one or more of said user interface objects, or a combination of one or more of said members and one or more of said user interface objects, each of said one or more subset data objects influencing both the appearance and behavior of said screen when so bound; and wherein a data object of said one or more subset data objects of said available for use automation process data objects can be dragged and dropped onto said screen design surface so as to create a corresponding user interface object, said corresponding user interface object automatically bound to said dragged data object when said dragged data object is placed on said screen design surface. 6. The computer program product of claim 5 wherein said set of customization components further comprises computer usable program code configured to provide an automation process object browser that lists all of said available for use automation process data objects. 7. The computer program product of claim 5 wherein said one or more user interface objects or said one or more members of said user interface objects has a predetermined data type and said subset of said available for use data objects has said predetermined data type. 8. The computer program product of claim 5 wherein said one or more user interface objects or said one or more members of said user interface objects has one data type and said subset of said available for use data objects has another data type, said databinding facility comprising a lookup table of at least two columns such that one of said two columns has said one data type and the other of said two columns has said another data type, said databinding facility using said table to bind one or more of said objects in said subset of said available for use data objects and one or more of said user interface objects or said one or more members of said user interface objects. 9. A system for developing for an automation process a viewable screen having user interface objects, said automation process having a set of data objects available for use in said system, said system comprising: a processor and a memory; said memory having therein program code usable by computer, said program code comprising: code configured to provide a set of common design time components from a general purpose software development kit, said common design time components comprising a screen design surface onto which said user interface objects are placed and a databinding facility; and code configured to provide a set of customization components comprising: code configured to provide an automation process object interface that allows access to said available for use automation process data objects, and code configured to provide a process object picker serving as a user interface to said databinding facility to allow: browsing a subset of said available for use automation process data objects, and selecting of one or more of said objects in said subset for binding by said databinding facility either to one or more of members of said user interface objects, one or more of said user interface objects, or a combination of one or more of said members and one or more of said user interface objects, each of said one or more subset data objects influencing both the appearance and behavior of said screen when so bound; and wherein a data object of said one or more subset data objects of said available for use automation process data objects can be dragged and dropped onto said screen design surface so as to create a corresponding user interface object, said corresponding user interface object automatically bound to said dragged data object when said dragged data object is placed on said screen design surface. 10.
