Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of clusterin. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding clusterin. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of clusterin expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of clusterin are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 65, 66, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 or 89 which inhibits the expression of human clusterin (SEQ ID NO: 3). 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 2 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human clusterin in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human clusterin is inhibited.
