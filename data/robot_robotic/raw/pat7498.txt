An improved tool mount structure allows the infinite placement of a tool along a generally elongate cylindrical member at an infinite number of locations. The elongate cylindrical member is fixed at each axial end to a generally rigid moving member such as a robotic arm boom or transfer bar. The cylindrical member is fixed in a bracket at one axial end, and into a quick-release mount at an opposed axial end. The cylindrical member may be quickly release from the moving member such that the tool may be easily changed. At the same time, by fixing the cylindrical member at each axial end, a secure rigid connection is provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A tool mounting system for mounting tools on a moving member comprising: a moving boom member fixed to a robotic manipulator to move said moving boom member and move tools fixed to said moving boom member; and at least one generally elongate tool mount fixed at each axial end to said moving boom member, and drive structure for driving said elongate tool mount forward of said moving member during selected periods of its operation cycle and also for retracting said elongate tool mount. 2. A tool mounting as recited in claim 1, wherein said elongate tool mount includes a moving member received in a fixed guide member, and said drive structure includes a fluid cylinder fixed between said moving member and said fixed guide member for driving said moving member forwardly.
