There is provided a pellicle in which the frame is chamfered along all of its horizontal edges (as viewed when the pellicle frame is laid flat), and in particular those edges of the frame where the membrane-bonding frame face meets the external side walls of the frame are chamfered to the extent of C:0.01 mm-C:0.12 mm; in relation to this chamfer, a method is also provided wherein, after attaching a preformed pellicle membrane to the membrane-bonding frame face, the excessive part of the preformed membrane which extends beyond outer edges of the frame face is cut off in a manner wherein a blade of a knife is caused to scour the chamfer over the membrane in a manner such that the knife blade is kept in such an angle that the blade gets in a face-to-face contact with the chamfer face or that the blade touches only that edge of the frame where the chamfer face meets the first frame face while the knife blade is moved along the chamfered edge of the frame.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A pellicle for lithography comprising a pellicle frame of which at least one side has a length not smaller than 300 mm, a pellicle membrane bonded on a first frame face of said pellicle frame by means of a membrane-bonding adhesive, and a mask-bonding adhesive layer attached to a second frame face of said pellicle frame, characterized in that said pellicle frame is chamfered along each of its edges where said first frame face joins an inner side wall of the pellicle frame or an outer side wall of the pellicle frame and along each of its edges where said second frame face joins the inner side wall of the pellicle frame or the outer side wall of the pellicle frame, and in that the chamfer made along those edges where said first frame face joins the outer side wall of the pellicle frame has a chamfer face size greater than C:0.01 mm but not greater than C:0.12 mm. 2. The pellicle for lithography according to claim 1 characterized in that the pellicle frame is made of an aluminum alloy of which the surface is almite-anodized. 3. A method for manufacturing a pellicle for lithography having a pellicle frame, a pellicle membrane bonded on a first frame face of said pellicle frame by means of a membrane-bonding adhesive, and a mask-bonding adhesive layer attached to a second frame face of said pellicle frame, comprising: (i) a step of chamfering said pellicle frame along each of its edges where said first frame face joins an inner side wall of the pellicle frame or an outer side wall of the pellicle frame and along each of its edges where said second frame face joins the inner side wall of the pellicle frame or the outer side wall of the pellicle frame, the chamfer made along those edges where said first frame face joins the outer side wall of the pellicle frame having a chamfer face size greater than C:0.01 mm but not greater than C:0.12 mm, and (ii) a step of cutting off an excessive portion of the pellicle membrane bonded on said first frame face which extends beyond outer edges of said first frame face, wherein a blade of a knife is caused to scour a chamfer over the membrane in a manner such that the knife blade is kept in a face-to-face contact with the chamfer face while the knife blade is moved along the chamfered edge of the frame. 4. A method for manufacturing a pellicle for lithography having a pellicle frame, a pellicle membrane bonded on a first frame face of said pellicle frame by means of a membrane-bonding adhesive, and a mask-bonding adhesive layer attached to a second frame face of said pellicle frame, comprising: (i) a step of chamfering said pellicle frame along each of its edges where said first frame face joins an inner side wall of the pellicle frame or an outer side wall of the pellicle frame and along each of its edges where said second frame face joins the inner side wall of the pellicle frame or the outer side wall of the pellicle frame, the chamfer made along those edges where said first frame face joins the outer side wall of the pellicle frame having a chamfer face size greater than C:0.01 mm but not greater than C:0.12 mm, and (ii) a step of cutting off an excessive portion of the pellicle membrane bonded on said first frame face which extends beyond outer edges of said first frame face, wherein a blade of a knife is caused to scour a chamfer over the membrane in a manner such that the knife blade is kept in an angle such that the blade touches only that edge of the frame where the chamfer face meets the first frame face while the knife blade is moved along the chamfered edge of the frame. 5. The method for manufacturing a pellicle for lithography according to claim 3, further comprising: a step of smoothing cut-end faces of the pellicle membrane after the cutting-off of said excessive portion of the pellicle membrane wherein the cut-end faces of the membrane are applied with solvent capable of dissolving the pellicle membrane by means of a resin wiper wetted with the solvent.
