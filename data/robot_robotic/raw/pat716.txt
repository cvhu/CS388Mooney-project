An object detecting device for detecting the existence and general placement of an object residing upon a surface. A preferred embodiment of the invention uses a laser measuring scanner operated positioned by a servo motor to allow the laser measuring scanner to generate signals related to the placement of an object on a surface. Those placement signals are then processed by a computer to make a two or three dimensional determination of the object in coordinates that show the object's location in relation to another device such as a robotic depalletizer that can then be moved into position near the object to allow removal of the object by the robotic depalletizer.
