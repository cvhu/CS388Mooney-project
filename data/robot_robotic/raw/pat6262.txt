Those hijackers seeking to commit suicide by crashing a plane into a selected target are frustrated because the selected targets, such as a nuclear plant or a governmental building, are provided with Repulsion Transmitters emanating an encrypted signal throughout a relatively small protective zonez. Planes are provided with receptors detecting such repulsion signals, together with discriminatory analyzers distinguishing between safe tangential travel through such zone and dangerous radial or spiral approach toward such target Both ground crew and the robotic controls within the plane are alerted and when appropriate, activated to re-route the plane to avoid the collision planned by the hijackers.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. Aircraft having repulsion receivers, said receivers of repulsion signals being adapted to receive signals from repulsion transmitters protecting a structure from aircraft entering a shielding zone of repulsion signals, said structure serving only land-based projects remote from an aircraft landing strip, which signals are processed by an on-board Discriminating Analyzer to activate on-board robotic controls to modify instantly the course of such aircraft to avoid collision with the protected structure. 2. The aircraft of claim 1 in which such Discriminating Analyzer ignores a course of the aircraft which is generally tangential to such zone of repulsion signals but which activates the robotic controls when the course of the aircraft is approximately radial toward such protected structure and the distance is dangerously close to such protected structure. 3. A method for protecting a building from aircraft in which a structure serving only land-based projects remote from an aircraft landing strip, said structure being provided with repulsive transmitters, and an aircraft is provided with on-board repulsion signal receivers and the aircraft is provided with on-board Discriminating Analyzers processing the signals received by such repulsive signal receivers, and the Discriminating Analyzers activate on-board robotic controls when the course of the aircraft endangers such protected structure, such robotic controls instantly modifying the course of the aircraft.
