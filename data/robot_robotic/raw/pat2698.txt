A method and system for transferring selected items among agents within a materials handling facility. According to one embodiment, a method may include a number of agents moving along respective paths through an inventory storage area of a materials handling facility. While moving along a respective path, a first agent may select items from the inventory storage area to be delivered to a corresponding order processing area, where each of the selected items may be specified in a corresponding customer order and at least two of the selected items may be delivered to two different corresponding order processing areas. After the first agent selects a particular item, the first agent may transfer the particular item to a second agent, and the second agent or another one of the agents may deliver the particular item to the corresponding order finalization area.
