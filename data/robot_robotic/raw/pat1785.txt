A communication robot including: a situation change detection unit for detecting writing of information into a situation database; a rule detection unit for detecting, from a rule database, a rule corresponding to the situation indicated by the data stored in the situation database when the writing of information into the situation database is detected by the situation change detection unit; an action inducing parameter setting unit for setting the degree of interest of the detected rule to at least one of movable parts and an audio output unit independently in the situation database; a parameter changing unit for independently changing the degree of interest set for the at least one of the movable parts and the audio output unit; and a command unit for requesting the at least one of the movable parts and the audio output unit to execute the execution command indicated by the detected rule.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A communication robot comprising: an external information acquiring unit for acquiring external information indicating a surrounding situation; an audio output unit for outputting a sound based on speech information; and a plurality of movable parts, each of which performs an action recognizable to a communication target, the communication robot further comprising: a situation database storing unit for storing a situation database which stores first data indicating a situation and second data related to operations of the audio output unit and the plurality of movable parts, the first data including the external information acquired by the external information acquiring unit which indicates the surrounding situation; a main controller which writes information in the situation database; a rule database storing unit for storing a rule database which includes a plurality of rules, each having an execution command of at least one of a speech and an action corresponding to the situation and an action inducing parameter which is related to an expression of the at least one of the speech and the action indicated by the execution command; a situation change detection unit for detecting writing of information by the main controller into the situation database as a situation change; a rule detection unit for detecting, from the rule database, a rule corresponding to the situation indicated by the first data stored in the situation database when the writing of information by the main controller into the situation database is detected by the situation change detection unit; an action inducing parameter setting unit for setting, as the second data stored in the situation database, the action inducing parameter contained in the rule to at least one of the movable parts and the audio output unit independently; a parameter changing unit for independently changing the action inducing parameter which has been set for the at least one of the movable parts and the audio output unit as the second data stored in the situation database; and a command unit for requesting the at least one of the movable parts and the audio output unit to execute the execution command indicated by the rule which includes the action inducing parameter set in the situation database, wherein each of the plurality of rules stored in the rule database includes an initial value and a damping rate of the action inducing parameter, the action inducing parameter setting unit sets the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule in the situation database, and the parameter changing unit decreases the initial value of the action inducing parameter set in the situation database according to the damping rate in response to an elapsed time. 2. The communication robot according to claim 1, wherein the parameter changing unit changes the damping rate of any one of the plurality of rules stored in the rule database depending on the number of times the any one of the plurality of rules is executed. 3. The communication robot according to claim 2, wherein the rule database includes a priority level in each of the plurality of rules, and the action inducing parameter setting unit includes: a priority level comparing unit for comparing the priority level contained in the rule and the priority level contained in a currently executing rule, a parameter comparing unit for comparing the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule and a present value of the action inducing parameter contained in the currently executing rule when the priority level contained in the rule is greater than the priority level of the currently executing rule, and a rule changing unit for setting the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule in the situation database when the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule is equal to or greater than the present value of the action inducing parameter of the currently executing rule. 4. The communication robot according to claim 3, wherein the situation database stores, as data indicating internal status of the communication robot, data indicating whether or not a battery of the communication robot is under charging, and the situation change detection unit is triggered to start a process for detecting a change in the situation database when the communication robot is connected to a battery charger. 5. The communication robot according to claim 2, wherein the situation database stores, as data indicating internal status of the communication robot, data indicating whether or not a battery of the communication robot is under charging, and the situation change detection unit is triggered to start a process for detecting a change in the situation database when the communication robot is connected to a battery charger. 6. The communication robot according to claim 1, wherein the rule database includes a priority level for each of the plurality of rules, and the action inducing parameter setting unit includes: a priority level comparing unit for comparing the priority level contained in the rule and the priority level contained in a currently executing rule, a parameter comparing unit for comparing the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule and a present value of the action inducing parameter contained in the currently executing rule when the priority level contained in the rule is greater than the priority level of the currently executing rule, and a rule changing unit for setting the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule in the situation database when the initial value of the action inducing parameter contained in the rule is equal to or greater than the present value of the action inducing parameter of the currently executing rule. 7. The communication robot according to claim 6, wherein the situation database stores, as data indicating internal status of the communication robot, data indicating whether or not a battery of the communication robot is under charging, and the situation change detection unit is triggered to start a process for detecting a change in the situation database when the communication robot is connected to a battery charger. 8. The communication robot according to claim 1, wherein the situation database stores, as data indicating internal status of the communication robot, data indicating whether or not a battery of the communication robot is under charging, and the situation change detection unit is triggered to start a process for detecting a change in the situation database when the communication robot is connected to a battery charger.
