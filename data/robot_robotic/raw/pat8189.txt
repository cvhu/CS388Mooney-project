Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of PEPCK-cytosolic. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding PEPCK-cytosolic. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of PEPCK-cytosolic expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of PEPCK-cytosolic are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 86, 87, 88, 94, 95, 108, 110, 113, 114, 121, 125, 140, 145, 157, 169, 173, 174 or 176 which inhibits the expression of PEPCK-cytosolic. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of PEPCK-cytosolic in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of PEPCK-cytosolic is inhibited.
