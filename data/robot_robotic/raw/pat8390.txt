The invention provides spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3'-oxindole] compounds produced by the stereo- and regio-selective reaction of variously substituted isatins, .alpha.-amino acids, and dipolarophiles (e.g., trans-chalcones, acrylate esters, or vinyl oxindoles).
Claims What is claimed is: 1.

The compound of claim 1, wherein R.sub.6 or R.sub.7, together with the carbon to which it is attached, and R.sub.12, together with the nitrogen to which it is attached, form a ring. 5. The compound of claim 1, wherein one of Ar.sub.1 and Ar.sub.2 is a heteroaryl group. 6. A method for preparing a spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3'-oxindole] compound of claim 1, the method comprising: reacting an isatin with an .alpha.-amino acid to form an azomethine ylide; and reacting the azomethine ylide with a chalcone to form the spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3'-oxindole] compound of claim 1. 7. The method of claim 6, wherein the .alpha.-amino acid is a naturally occurring amino acid. 8. The method of claim 6, wherein the .alpha.-amino acid is a cyclic amino acid. 9. The method of claim 6, wherein the azomethine ylide is reacted with a chalcone in a solvent. 10. The method of claim 9, wherein the solvent comprises dioxane. 11. The method of claim 6, wherein both reacting steps are conducted in the same solvent. 12. The method of claim 11, wherein the method is conducted with a single reaction vessel. 13. The method of claim 6, wherein one or more steps of the method is conducted at a temperature of 60 to 95.degree. C. 14. The method of claim 6, wherein one or more steps of the method is conducted at a temperature of 80 to 85.degree. C. 15. The method of claim 6, wherein the isatin has the structural formula: ##STR7## wherein R.sub.1 to R.sub.4, independently, is a hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, carbocyclic, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, thio, hydroxyl, alkylthio, alkoxy, carboxy, sulfonyl, nitro, cyano, amido, keto, formyl, or amino group, and wherein R.sub.5 is hydrogen, or an alkyl, aryl, or carbocyclic group. 16. The method of claim 15, wherein R.sub.5 is hydrogen. 17. The method of claim 15, wherein R.sub.5 is an aryl group. 18. The method of claim 15, wherein R.sub.5 is an alkyl group. 19.
