Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of testing at least one embedded device under test (DUT) comprising: determining a test configuration parameter set comprising predefined DUT test sequence rules; determining a first data set comprising input test vectors based on the test configuration parameter set; processing the first data set in a DUT model to determine output test vectors wherein the output test vectors comprise DUT model generated responses to the input test vectors; processing the first data set and the output test vectors, comprising: parsing the output test vectors with the first data set in accordance with a predefined timing reference in which the predefined timing reference determines a point in time to sample an output test vector as a stabilised output test vector; and matching each stabilised output test vector to form pairs of stabilised input and output test vectors to determine a second data set comprising pairs of stabilised input and output test vectors; communicating the stabilised input test vectors to at least one DUT via a DUT independent interface so that the at least one DUT is stimulated by the stabilised input test vectors to produce DUT output vectors; determining a third data set comprising the stabilised input vectors and corresponding DUT output vectors; and comparing the third data set with the second data set to determine a comparison of actual behaviour to modelled behaviour of the at least one DUT; wherein the predefined timing reference is derived from a logical connection port adapted to indicate a predefined timing reference for determining a point in time at which to sample an output vector as the corresponding output vector in an input/output vector pair. 2.
