A processing station adaptable to standard cluster tools has a vertically-translatable pedestal having an upper wafer-support surface including a heater plate adapted to be plugged into a unique feedthrough in the pedestal. At a lower position for the pedestal wafers may be transferred to and from the processing station, and at an upper position for the pedestal the pedestal forms an annular pumping passage with a lower circular opening in a processing chamber. A removable, replaceable ring at the lower opening of the processing chamber allows process pumping speed to be tailored for different processes by replacing the ring. In some embodiments the pedestal also has a surrounding shroud defining an annular pumping passage around the pedestal. A unique two-zone heater plate is adapted to the top of the pedestal, and connects to a unique feedthrough allowing heater plates to be quickly and simply replaced. In some embodiments the top of the processing chamber is removable allowing users to remove either pedestals or heater assemblies. Or both, through the open top of a processing station. In preferred embodiments the system is adapted to atomic layer deposition processing.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An ALD processing station, comprising a substrate support pedestal vertically movable within a processing chamber, the ALD processing station configured such that when the substrate support pedestal is in a first position within the processing chamber a first pumping passage having a first effective area determining a first a pumping speed is created and when the substrate support pedestal is in a second position within the processing chamber a second pumping passage having a second effective area determining a second pumping speed greater than the first pumping speed is created.
