The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating the expression of growth factor gene. In particular, this invention relates to compounds, particularly oligonucleotide compounds, which, in preferred embodiments, hybridize with nucleic acid molecules encoding the Insulin Like Growth Factor I receptor (IGF-I receptor or IGF-IR) and in particular human IGF-IR. Such compounds are exemplified herein to modulate proliferation which is relevant to the treatment of proliferative and inflammatory skin disorders and cancer. It will be understood, however, that the compounds can be used for any other condition in which the IGF-IR is involved including inflammatory condition.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A composition comprising an antisense compound consisting of a modified oligonucleotide consisting of 20 linked nucleosides and consisting of a nucleobase sequence recited in SEQ ID NO: 125, wherein said compound inhibits the expression of IGF-IR, and wherein said modified oligonucleotide consists of a ten deoxynucleotide region flanked on both the 5' and 3' end of said ten deoxynucleotide region with five 2'-O-(2-methoxyethoxy)nucleotides, wherein each internucleoside linkage in said modified oligonucleotide is a phosphorothioate linkage and each cytosine in said modified oligonucleotide is a 5-methylcytosine, said composition further comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents. 2. A kit comprising the composition of claim 1 or an antisense compound consisting of a modified oligonucleotide consisting of 20 linked nucleosides and consisting of a nucleobase sequence recited in SEQ ID NO: 125, wherein said compound inhibits the expression of IGF-IR, and wherein said modified oligonucleotide consists of a ten deoxynucleotide region flanked on both the 5' and 3' end of said ten deoxynucleotide region with five 2'-O-(2-methoxyethoxy)nucleotides, wherein each internucleoside linkage in said modified oligonucleotide is a phosphorothioate linkage and each cytosine in said modified oligonucleotide is a 5-methylcytosine.
