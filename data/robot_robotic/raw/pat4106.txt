A load lock is provided for a semiconductor substrate processing system having a transport robot mounted therein. The load lock transport supplies substrates directly to a processing chamber without the need for a central transport robot. The load lock transport is a dual element robot designed for minimum clearance and space and operates within a matching load lock chamber of minimum volume.
Claims I claim: 1. A load lock system constructed to supply semiconductor substrates to a process chamber according to a predetermined sequence, said process chamber processing said substrate in a process cycle, said load lock system comprising: a housing having a load lock chamber constructed therein, said load lock chamber connected to said process chamber by a process port and to a front end delivery module by a delivery port; a first valve for opening and closing said process port according to said predetermined sequence; a second valve for opening and closing said delivery port according to said predetermined sequence; a pump connected to the housing and arranged for cycling said load lock chamber , with said first and second valves closed between different loadlock atmospheres, at least one of which enables opening of the first valve, and at least another of which enables opening of the second valve; a transport, mounted in the load lock chamber, constructed to move substrates into said process chamber for processing, said transport further comprising: a lower arm mounted in the load lock chamber at a proximal end of said arm for pivotal motion about a first axis, said lower arm connected to a first drive element of a drive mechanism to provide a controlled rotation of said lower arm about said first axis; at least one effector arm mounted on a distal end of said lower arm for pivotal motion about a second axis parallel to said first axis, said effector arm having a receiving end for engagement of said substrates and being connected to a second drive of said drive mechanism to provide a controlled rotation about said second axis; and a process controller connected to said process chamber, first and second valves and biaxial drive for controlling the operation thereof in said predetermined sequence; wherein said predetermined sequence is timed to cycle said load lock chamber within the process cycle of said processing chamber. 2.
