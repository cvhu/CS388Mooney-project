A chute for gravity feeding a plurality of like electrical components (1) to a pick-up station of a robotic controlled automatic assembly system comprises guide rails (2,3) down which components slide with their pins (13) extending between the rails. The rails are shaped to provide a downwardly inclined straight track (5) leading into a horizontal track (6) comprising the pick-up station from which the components are taken by the robot. The transition from the inclined track (approximately 30 degrees to the horizontal) to the straight track, although smooth, is quite abrupt and ensures that the next component is successfully fed from the inclined to the horizontal section of the chute each time its predecessor is removed from the pick-up station. Since the length of the horizontal track is such that only one component can be accommodated at a time, accurate positioning of the component in the pick-up station for access by the robot is guaranteed.
Claims We claim: 1. A system comprising a plurality of like electrical components and a chute for gravity feeding of said electrical components to a pick-up station for subsequent access and removal by a pick-up mechanism, said electrical components each having a generally cuboid shape and predetermined size and having leading and trailing edges and electrical connection pins (13) extending downwardly from one surface thereof, said chute comprising a downwardly inclined first straight section (5) having a bottom surface, the lower end of said downwardly inclined first straight section leading with an abrupt change in direction into a second straight section (6) serving as a pick-up station from which said electrical components are removed by the pick-up mechanism and having a bottom surface, said second straight section being closely sized to accommodate only one of said electrical components of predetermined size at a time and said chute further having two identical spaced apart parallel guide rails (2,3) extending upwardly from the bottom surfaces of said first and second straight sections of said chute, said guide rails being chamfered on the upper edges thereof to provide low friction surfaces to support said electrical components and shaped to provide a downwardly inclined straight track (5) within said first straight section adapted to receive at its upper end electrical components fed thereto, said track (5) leading abruptly into a horizontal straight track (6) within said second straight section, the second straight section (6) further having an end stop the electrical components feeding closely adjacent one another throughout the length of the chute and the tangential relationship of the first straight section with respect to the second straight section of the chute establishing a condition wherein the leading edge of any electrical component in the chute next in line to enter the second straight section overlaps the trailing edge of any electrical component in the second straight section, the construction and arrangement of the parallel guide rails being such that they are sufficiently spaced to receive therebetween the pins (13) of electrical components supplied thereto but sufficiently close to each other to support the edges of the surface of the electrical component from which the pins extend, whereby the sliding contact between the pins and guide rails provides lateral restraint and registration for the electrical components as they slide in succession down the chute and into the second straight section and whereby access and removal of an electrical component from the second straight section by the pick-up mechanism by virtue of the overlapping of edges of an electrical component next in line and the constraints on lateral movement established due to the close size relationship of the second straight section and an electrical component in the second straight section imparts a lifting action of the electrical component next in line and aids its free movement into the second straight section.
