A tool attachment and release system for robotic arms which using a magnet for supplying the attractive force to hold the tool to the robotic arm while allowing separation of tools from the robotic arm without manual intervention. A series of tools are held at predetermined locations in a tool rack allowing the robot to automatically deposit therein or acquire therefrom a particular tool. Permanent magnets are mounted between steel inserts in the tool attachment block. The steel insert are used to direct and concentrate magnetic flux to the tool attachment surface and also to each of two shunt bar contact surfaces. During the attach and disconnect operations, magnetic flux shunt bars are placed in close proximity to the two shunt bar contact surfaces to thereby provide an alternative path for the magnetic flux. This greatly reduces but does not eliminate the attractive force between the tool adapter plate and the attachment block. This results in a relatively easy disconnect of a particular tool with its associated adapter plate thus allowing a simple, inexpensive, low force capability device to be used for controlling the disconnect process. However, there will remain enough residual attractive force to keep the adapter plate from falling off of the attachment block in an uncontrolled manner.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A tool attachment and release system for robotic arms comprising: (a) a tool rack having at least two tool slots therein, each of said at least two tool slots being capable of supporting a selectable tool, each of said tool slots including an open end and two sides, each of said selectable tools including a tool adapter plate; (b) a tool attachment block adapted to be attached to a robotic arm, said tool attachment block including a permanent magnet, said permanent magnet affixing said tool attachment block to a selected one of said tool adapter plates when the robotic arm is manipulated to cause said tool attachment block to abut said selected one of said tool adapter plates; (c) a magnetic shunt bar receptacle located on each of said two sides of each of said tool slots; and (d) a magnetic shunt bar residing in each of said magnetic shunt bar receptacles, said magnetic shunt bars remaining attached to said tool attachment block when said tool attachment block is moved in a first direction away from said tool slot to thereby leave said selectable tool supported in said tool slot, said magnetic shunt bars remaining in said shunt bar receptacles when said tool attachment block is moved in a second direction away from said tool slot to thereby remove said selectable tool from said tool slot. 2. A tool attachment and release system for robotic arms comprising: (a) a tool rack having at least one tool slot therein, said tool slot being capable of supporting a tool, said tool slot including an open end, a closed end and two sides, said tool including a tool adapter plate; (b) a tool attachment block adapted to be attached to a robotic arm, said tool attachment block including a permanent magnet, said permanent magnet affixing said tool attachment block to said tool adapter plate when the robotic arm is manipulated to cause said tool attachment block to abut said tool adapter plate; (c) a magnetic shunt bar receptacle located on each of said two sides of said tool slot; and (d) a magnetic shunt bar residing in each of said magnetic shunt bar receptacles, said magnetic shunt bars remaining attached to said tool attachment block when said tool attachment block is moved in a first direction away from said tool slot to thereby leave a tool supported in said tool slot, said magnetic shunt bars remaining in said shunt bar receptacles when said tool attachment block is moved in a second direction away from said tool slot to thereby remove said tool from said tool slot. 3. A tool attachment and detachment apparatus comprising: (a) a tool rack having at least one tool slot therein, said tool slot being capable of supporting a tool, said tool slot including an open end and two sides, said tool including a tool adapter plate; (b) a tool attachment block adapted to be attached to a robotic arm, said tool attachment block including a permanent magnet, said permanent magnet affixing said tool adapter plate to said tool attachment block when said tool attachment block is caused to abut said tool adapter plate; (c) a magnetic shunt bar receptacle located on each of said two sides of said tool slot; and (d) a magnetic shunt bar residing in each of said magnetic shunt bar receptacles, said magnetic shunt bars redirecting a portion of the magnetic flux of said permanent magnet when in contact with said tool attachment block thereby lessen the magnetic attachment force between said tool attachment block and said tool adapter plate when said tool attachment block is moved in a first direction away from said tool slot to thereby leave a tool supported in said tool slot, said magnetic shunt bars remaining in said shunt bar receptacles when said tool attachment block is moved in a second direction away from said tool slot to thereby remove said tool from said tool slot. 4. A tool attachment and release system for robotic arms comprising: (a) at least one selectable tool supported in a tool rack, each of said selectable tools including a tool adapter plate; (b) a tool attachment block adapted to be affixed to a robotic arm, said tool attachment block including at least one permanent magnet, said at least one permanent magnet generating a pattern of magnetic flux, said pattern of magnetic flux being directed through a selected one of said tool adapter plates when said tool attachment block is caused to abut said selected one of said tool adapter plates, said pattern of magnetic flux affixing said tool attachment block to said selected one of said tool adapter plates; and (c) means for redirecting a portion of said pattern of magnetic flux away from said selected one of said tool adapter plates. 5. A tool attachment and release system as recited in claim 4, said tool rack comprising: at least two tool slots, each of said at least two tool slots being capable of supporting a selectable tool, each of said at least two tool slots including an open end and two sides. 6. A tool attachment and release system as recited in claim 5 wherein: each of said selectable tools includes a tool adapter plate. 7. A tool attachment and release system as recited in claim 6 wherein said means for redirecting comprises: a shunt bar receptacle in each of said sides of said at least two tool slots, each of said shunt bar receptacles capable of retaining a shunt bar therein, said shunt bars being magnetically attached to said tool attachment block when said tool attachment block is mated to a selected one of tool adapter plates, said shunt bars remaining attached to said tool attachment block when said tool attachment block is moved in a first direction, said shunt bars remaining in said shunt bar receptacles when said tool attachment block when said tool attachment block is moved in a second direction. 8. A tool attachment and release system as recited in claim 1 wherein: said at least one permanent magnet generates a pattern of magnetic flux, said pattern of magnetic flux being directed through a selected one of said tool adapter plates when said tool attachment block is caused to abut said selected one of said tool adapter plates, said pattern of magnetic flux affixing said tool attachment block to said selected one of said tool adapter plates; and said magnetic shunt bars redirect a portion of said pattern of the magnetic flux when said magnetic shunt bars are in contact with said tool attachment block thereby lessening a magnetic force of attachment between said tool attachment block and said tool adapter plate.
