A process for the production of a void-free semiconductor wafer for the electronics industry, comprising the steps of: applying a coating of a solder paste to a semiconductor wafer through a photoresist film; heating and applying a vacuum to the wafer in a reflow furnace with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient to for a first reflow to remove the flux and form void free solder bumps on the wafer; processing the wafer to remove the photoresist film; heating the wafer in a reflow furnace with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient for a second reflow to remove surface oxides from the wafer and to form the solder into final void free metal solder bumps.
Claims I claim: 1. A process for the production of a void-free semiconductor wafer for the electronics industry through a rotatably indexed sequence of isolated, pressure controlled chambers in a wafer processing apparatus cycling between a vacuum and a controlled ambient pressure, comprising the steps of: applying a solder paste through a photoresist film mask to a semiconductor wafer which is to be processed by said apparatus placing said wafer in a chamber and purging said chamber with nitrogen and applying a vacuum to said chamber; heating said wafer in a reflow furnace to a temperature below the melting point of solder under a vacuum in a successive chamber of said apparatus; heating said wafer in a reflow furnace with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient for a second reflow to remove surface oxides from said wafer and to form said solder into final metal solder bumps in a final chamber; and cooling said wafer in a further chamber to harden said solder. 2. The process of claim 1, wherein said first reflow step includes; applying a vacuum during said heating of said wafer. 3. A process for the production of a void-free semiconductor wafer for the electronics industry, comprising the steps of: applying a paste through a photoresist film mask onto a semiconductor wafer to be subsequently processed in a sequence of circumferentially adjacent chambers which chambers are pressure cycled between a controlled ambient pressure and a vacuum therewithin; rotating said wafer to a chamber and heating said wafer to a temperature below the melting point of solder and applying a vacuum to said wafer in a reflow furnace with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient for a first reflow to remove the flux and form void free solder bumps on said wafer; processing said wafer in a further chamber by again heating said wafer at a temperature below the melting point of solder and under a vacuum; further processing said wafer at a subsequent chamber by heating said wafer to a temperature above the melting point of solder and maintaining a vacuum during the solder melting process; heating said wafer again to effect solder reflow in a further chamber reflow furnace with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient for a second reflow to remove surface oxides from said wafer and to form said solder into final metal solder bumps; and advancing said wafer to a cooling chamber to harden said solder into a void free state. 4. A process for the production of a void-free semiconductor wafer for the electronics industry through a plurality of annularly disposed, independently atmospherically controlled processing stations in a semiconductor processing apparatus, comprising the steps of: applying a photoresist film mask through a mask to a semiconductor wafer and loaded into a first chamber to be further processed at a controlled ambient pressure or vacuum; applying a vacuum to said wafer in a first reflow furnace with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient for a first reflow to remove the flux and form void free solder bumps on said wafer in a further chamber; processing said wafer in a further chamber to remove said photoresist film; heating said wafer in a reflow furnace above the melting point of solder with a controlled formic acid vapor ambient for a second reflow to remove surface oxides from said wafer and to form said solder into final metal solder bumps; and chilling said wafer in a further chamber. 5. The process as recited in claim 4, wherein the first reflow step includes: heating said wafer to a temperature just below the melting temperature of said solder on said wafer.
