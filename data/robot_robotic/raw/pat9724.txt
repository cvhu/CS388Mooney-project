The present invention provides an optical disk carrier having the same length and width as an ISO standard cartridge but with a reduced thickness and further having the same sensing and handling features as are found on a conventional, full-thickness cartridge. When reduced-thickness carriers are used in an automated optical storage and retrieval library, the storage density of the library can be significantly increased.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An optical disk carrier, comprising: a substantially rectangular frame having dimensions sized to be inserted into an optical disk drive and having a substantially circular opening with a diameter sized to receive an optical disk, said frame further having front and rear edges; a write-protect mechanism in a first corner portion of said rear edge of said frame, said write-protect mechanism comprising: an arm pivotable about an axis whereby, when said arm is in a first position, a write-protect hole through said frame is exposed and, when said arm is in a second position, said write-protect hole is concealed; and an aperture extending vertically through said arm and an elongated member projecting from said aperture, such that, when two optical disk carriers are stacked, said elongated member of a lower carrier engages said aperture of an upper carrier and said write-protect mechanism of each carrier is movable simultaneously; and a set of disk holders spaced around the circumference of the circular opening and secured to said frame for releasably retaining the optical disk within the circular opening whereby, when the carrier is mounted in an optical drive, said disk holders release the optical disk to be rotated on a spindle in the drive and, when the carrier is removed from the drive, said disk holders retain the disk within the circular opening preventing movement thereof, said set of disk holders comprising: a leaf spring positioned substantially in the center of said rear edge of said frame, said leaf spring having a central portion with a grooved face for engaging a circumferential edge of the optical disk, said grooved face being biased towards the circular opening; and first and second arms pivotably mounted in first and second corners portions, respectively, of said front edge of said frame, each of said arms having a first end portion with a grooved face for engaging the circumferential edge of the optical disk, said grooved face being biased towards the circular opening.
