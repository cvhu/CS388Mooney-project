An electronic module includes electronic circuitry and first and second connection mechanisms, both operationally connected to the electronic circuitry, for mounting the module in a larger electronic device by different respective methods. Preferably, the first connection mechanism is a robotic connection mechanism such as a BGA with one or more solder balls and the second connection mechanism is a manual connection mechanism such as a plug with one or more electrically conducting pads, both mechanisms being for mounting the module on a PCB.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electronic module, comprising: (a) electronic circuitry; (b) a first connection mechanism, including at least one substantially hemispherical solder ball, and operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by a first method; and (c) a second connection mechanism, including at least one electrically conducting pad, and operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by a second method different from said first method; wherein mounting using only said first connection mechanism suffices to render the electronic module fully operational; and wherein mounting using only said second connection mechanism suffices to render the electronic module fully operational. 2. The electronic module of claim 1, wherein said at least one solder ball and said at least one pad are like in number. 3. The electronic module of claim 2, further comprising: (d) for each said solder ball, and for a respective said pad, a respective wire operationally connecting said each solder ball to said respective pad.
