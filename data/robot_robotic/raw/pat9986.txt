In a system for restoring a controlled unit from an abnormal condition, a plurality of predicted abnormal conditions and corresponding restoring procedures are prestored. When an actually generated abnormal condition matches with one of the prestored abnormal conditions, the system restores the controlled unit from the abnormal condition based on the prestored restoring procedure corresponding to the abnormal condition which matches with the actually generated abnormal condition.
Claims What is claimed is: 1.

A sequence control system in which a sequence program is written in the form of a sequential function chart having a plurality of numbered steps, said sequence control system comprising: state output means having step output means for outputting a number corresponding to a currently executed step in said sequence program, and time output means for outputting a current time; abnormality determining means including: time storing means for prestoring a maximum execution time for each step corresponding to each step number of said sequence program, state storing means for storing a step execution starting time comprising said step number received from said step output means and said current time received from said time output means, and determining means, operative in response to said step number output from said state output means matching one of said stored step numbers, for calculating a difference between said current time output from said time output means and said stored step execution starting time corresponding to said matching stored step number, and for determining abnormality of said system when said calculated difference exceeds said prestored maximum execution time corresponding to said matching step number; and restoring means for executing an automatic restoring procedure corresponding to said matching step number when said determining means determines said abnormality of said system. 4. The sequence control system as set forth in claim 3, wherein an operator records a manual restoring operation which is executed as said automatic restoring procedure, and wherein said manual restoring operation is recorded corresponding to said matched step number. 5. The sequence control system as set forth in claim 3, wherein an operator records a manual restoring operation including an operator message which is executed as said automatic restoring procedure, and wherein said manual restoring operation is recorded corresponding to said matched step number. 6. A sequence control system in which a sequence program is written in the form of a ladder sequence diagram, said sequence control system comprising: state output means having operation storing means for storing conditions indicating which steps in said sequence program have been completed, said state output means outputting a state pattern based on said conditions; abnormality determining means for determining a type of abnormality of the system based on said state pattern output by said state output means; and restoring means for executing an automatic restoring procedure corresponding to said abnormality type determined by said abnormality determining means. 7. The sequence control system as set forth in claim 6, wherein said operation storing means stores said condition for each of the steps as an ON or OFF state, and wherein said abnormality determining means determines said type of the abnormality based on a pattern of said ON and OFF states. 8. The sequence control system as set forth in claim 6, wherein timer means are provided for monitoring an execution time of one cycle of said sequence program, and wherein said state output means outputs said state pattern when said monitored execution time exceeds a preset maximum execution time. 9. The sequence control system as set forth in claim 6, wherein timer means are provided for monitoring an execution time of one cycle of said sequence program, wherein said state output means outputs said state pattern when said monitored execution time exceeds a preset maximum execution time, wherein said abnormality determining means further includes pattern storing means for storing a plurality of state patterns which correspond to types of system abnormalities, and wherein said abnormality determining means determines said type of the abnormality when said state pattern output by said state output means matches one of said stored state patterns. 10. The sequence control system as set forth in claim 6, wherein timer means are provided for monitoring an execution time of one cycle of said sequence program, wherein said state output means outputs said state pattern when said monitored execution time exceeds a preset maximum execution time, wherein said abnormality determining means further includes pattern storing means for storing a plurality of state patterns which correspond to types of system abnormalities and a plurality of restoring procedures corresponding to said stored state patterns, wherein said abnormality determining means determines said type of the abnormality when said state pattern output by said state output means matches one of said stored state patterns, and wherein said automatic restoring procedure executed by said restoring means corresponding to said matched state pattern output by said state output means.
