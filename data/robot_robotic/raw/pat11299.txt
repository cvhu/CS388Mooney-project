A military tank is equipped with an armored box structure in the space nolly occupied by the gun turret. A lid on the box structure is raisable to an inclined position suitable for the firing of a missile carried on the lid undersurface. As the missile is fired an explosive-charged line attached to the missile rear end is drawn out of the box structure onto the terrain (along the missile line-of-flight). By exploding the line charges it is possible to detonate enemy land mines in the vicinity of the charged line.
