An apparatus and method of a robot or like end-of-arm tool (EOAT) for gripping workpieces by cavities in the workpieces is provided. The EOAT is connected with the robot or like and includes an extendible rod having a generally flanged end opposite the robot. The EOAT also includes at least one spacer encircling the rod between the robot or like and the flanged end of the rod, and at least two elastomeric gripper portions encircling the rod and capturing at least one spacer. The gripper portions have a first dimension when the rod is extended whereby at least one of the gripper portions can be inserted into a workpiece cavity and the gripper portions have a second dimension when the rod is retracted whereby the gripper portions can engage with the workpiece cavity to grip the workpiece.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A robot or like EOAT for gripping a first workpiece by a first cavity in said first workpiece, and a second workpiece by a second cavity in said second workpiece said second cavity being substantially smaller than said first cavity, said EOAT in combination comprising: means for connecting said EOAT with said robot or like, said connecting means including: axial posts connected with said robot or like having a flanged end opposite said robot or like; a cylinder with holes aligned with said axial posts mounted on said axial posts, said cylinder having a central bore on an end of said cylinder opposite said robot or like; first spring means biasing said cylinder away from said robot or like; a plate slidably mounted within said cylinder with at least three geometrically spaced radial passages with a slidably mounted plunger mounted therein; second spring means biasing said plungers outward against said cylinder centering said plate within said cylinder; a stud connected with said plate projecting through said cylinder central bore; a fluid actuated cylinder connected with said stud; and a rod extendible by said fluid actuated cylinder, said rod having a flanged end; a tapered spacer encircling said rod between said fluid actuated cylinder and said flanged end of said rod having a larger diameter on an end of said spacer toward said fluid actuator cylinder; and first and second gripper portions encircling said rod capturing said spacer, said first and second gripper portions each having an elastomeric annular-shaped section press-fitted upon a disk, said disk having a bore with a diameter closely adjacent to said rod and said first gripper portion having a larger diameter and being more adjacent to said fluid actuated cylinder than said second gripper portion and whereby said spacer tapers from an outer diameter of said first gripper portion to a dimension smaller than said inner diameter of said second gripper portion elastomeric section, whereby said first and second gripper portions have a first dimension when said rod means is extended wherein said gripper portions can be inserted into a respective workpiece cavity and said gripper portions having a second dimension when said rod means is retracted wherein said gripper portions can engage with said respective workpiece cavity to grip said respective workpiece. 2. A robot or like end-of-arm tool (EAOT) for gripping workpieces by cavities in said workpieces, said EOAT in combination comprising: means for connecting said EOAT with said robot or like; rod means having a generally flanged end opposite said robot being extendible with respect to said connecting means; at least one spacer encircling said rod means between said connecting means and said flanged end of said rod; and at least two elastomeric gripper portions encircling said rod means and capturing at least one spacer, said gripper portions having a first dimension when said rod means is extended whereby said gripper portions can be inserted into one of said workpieces' cavities and said gripper portions having a second dimension when said rod means is retracted whereby said gripper portions can engage with one of said workpieces' cavity to grip said workpiece and a section of one of said gripper portions facing said spacer is annular shaped and said spacer has a tapered end with a diameter smaller than an inside diameter of said gripper section.
