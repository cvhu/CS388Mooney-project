A composition comprising a polymerization modifier for the copolymerization of at least one olefin monomer and propylene and a polymerization process using the polymerization modifier.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A composition comprising a polymerization modifier for the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene comprising (dodecyloxy)dioctylaluminum, (bis(trimethylsilyl)amino)dioctylaluminum, phenoxydioctylaluminum, (4-methyl-2,6-di(t-butyl)phenoxy)dioctylaluminum, (t-butyldimethylsiloxy) dioctylaluminum, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminodiethylaluminum, or bis(t-butyldimethylsiloxy) isopropylaluminum. 2. The composition of claim 1 further comprising a transition metal complex and a cocatalyst. 3. The composition of claim 2 wherein the metal complex comprises a complex of hafnium and a pyridylamine; and, the cocatalyst comprises tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron or a trialkylammonium salt of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. 4. A polymerization process comprising contacting ethylene and propylene under polymerization conditions with the composition of claim 2. 5. The polymerization process of claim 4 wherein the metal complex comprises a complex of hafnium and a pyridylamine; and, the cocatalyst comprises tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron or a trialkylammonium salt of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. 6. The polymerization process of claim 4 wherein the metal complex comprises 2[N-(2,6-diisopropylphenylamido)-o-isopropylphenylmethyl]-6-(2-- .eta.-1-naphthyl)-pyridyl hafnium(IV) dimethyl, the cocatalyst comprises a mixture of methyldi(C.sub.14 -18) long chain alkyl ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate salts.
