A method for managing Data Storage Medium (DSM) mount and demount decisions in an automated data storage library that dynamically optimizes both sequential and random data access workloads. The demount decisions adapt to time-varying characteristics in the relative workload mix. When the workload is primarily sequential, the mount and demount decision procedure favors longer mount residency for sequential access streams, reducing the robotic picker activity and reducing response time for mount requests. When the workload is predominantly random access, sequentially accessed DSM residency time is generally reduced and preemptive demounts are more readily implemented. The disclosed method provides for preemptive demounts and uses a two-element decision process to select either a Least Recently Used (LRU) or a Least Recently Mounted (LRM) decision parameter. The relative weights of the LRU and LRM decision tests are varied responsive to measured changes in data access workload characteristics.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for selecting one of a plurality of data storage media (DSMs) for demount from one of a plurality of peripheral data storage devices (PDSDs) in an automated data storage library, having means for mounting a requested said DSM responsive to at least one mounting command, wherein said automated data storage library includes discriminator means for discriminating between random data access operations and sequential data access operations, each said PDSD being for storing or accessing data in at least one said DSM mounted thereon, said method comprising the unordered steps of: (a) determining the idle time interval (Ti) since the last access for each said PDSD; (b) assigning to a demount candidate group each said PDSD for which said idle time interval (T.sub.i) is not less than a first predetermined time interval threshold (t.sub.1); (c) if said demount candidate group has one or more members, selecting the least recently mounted (LRM) said member for immediate demount, otherwise: (d) per:forming said steps (a)-(c) again after a predetermined second time interval (t.sub.2); and (e) halting said method after a limit number (k) of consecutive repetitions of said performing step (d) over a continuous retry time interval during which said conditional selecting step (c) is not performed: (f) selecting the LRM said PDSD for demount responsive to said mounting command if said demount candidate group has no members: (g) modifying said first predetermined time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and said predetermined limit number (k) responsive to said discriminator means; (h) comparing the DSMs mounted in said PDSDs to a dismount history list to determine a degree of commonality (z), wherein said dismount history includes a list of a plurality of said DSMs that were previously dismounted; and (i) revising said first predetermined time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and said predetermined limit number (k) responsive to said degree of commonality (z), whereby the effects of said method are adjusted for changes in data access patterns. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said revising step (i) includes the steps of: (i.1) increasing said first predetermined time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and increasing said predetermined limit number (k) responsive to a low-valued said degree of commonality (z); and (i.2) decreasing said first predetermined time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and decreasing said predetermined limit number (k) responsive to a high-valued said degree of commonality (z). 3. A method for selecting one of a plurality of data storage media (DSMs) for demount from one of a plurality of peripheral data storage devices (PDSDs) in an automated data storage library, having means for mounting a requested said DSM responsive to at least one mounting command, each said PDSD being for storing or accessing data in at least one said DSM mounted thereon, wherein said automated data storage library includes discriminator means for discriminating between random data access operations and sequential data access operations, said method comprising the unordered steps of: (a) determining the idle time interval (T.sub.i) since the last access for each said PDSD; (b) assigning to a demount candidate group each said PDSD for which said idle time interval (T.sub.i) is not less than a first predetermined time interval threshold (t.sub.1); (c) if said demount candidate group has one or more members, selecting the least recently mounted (LRM) said member for immediate demount, otherwise; (d) performing said steps (a)-(c) again after a predetermined second time interval (t.sub.2); and (e) halting said method after a limit number (k) of consecutive repetitions of said performing step (d) over a continuous retry time interval during which said conditional selecting step (c) is not performed: (f) modifying said first time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and said limit number (k) responsive to said discriminator means: (g) comparing the DSMs mounted in said PDSDs to a dismount history list to determine a degree of commonality (z), wherein said dismount history list includes a list of a plurality of said DSMs that were previously dismounted; and (h) revising said first time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and said number (k) responsive to said degree of commonality (z), whereby the effects of said method are adjusted for changes in data access patterns. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein said revising step (h) includes the steps of: (h.1) increasing said first time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and increasing said limit number (k) responsive to a low-valued said degree of commonality (z); and (h.2) decreasing said first time interval threshold (t.sub.1) and decreasing said limit number (k) responsive to a high-valued said degree of commonality (z).
