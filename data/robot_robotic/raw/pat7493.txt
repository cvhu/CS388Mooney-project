A system for operating an autonomous robot for performing tasks, such as lawn mowing, includes an indicator and a robot configured for detecting the indicator and generating a map of the working area bounded by the indicator and correcting the position of the robot in accordance with the generated map of the working area.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for automatically operating a robot within a working area comprising: at least one indicator positionable to define the boundary of said working area; and a robot comprising: a sensor adapted for detecting said indicator; a processor in operative communication with said sensor, said processor programmed to: initially generate a map of said working area in accordance with at least a substantial traversal of said working area along a path corresponding to the position of said at least one indicator; and correct the position of said robot in accordance with said generated map when said at least one indicator is reached; a locator configured for determining the coordinates of said robot relative to an arbitrary origin at any specific time; memory for storing values generated by said processor; a direction finder configured for determining the direction of travel of said robot; and a motion controller configured for causing said robot to move in a substantially continuous manner. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein said at least one indicator includes at least one metallic wire. 3. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is additionally programmed to: activate said robot and cause said robot to move to a position corresponding to at least a portion of said boundary defined by said at least one indicator. 4. The system of claim 1, wherein said robot additionally comprises a lawn mowing system.
