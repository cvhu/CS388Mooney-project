The assembly further comprises a plurality of longitudinally extending electrical conductors for providing power from a power supply to the at least two printhead integrated circuits, being arranged as two groups of electrical conductors respectively connected to the power supply at respective ends of the printhead assembly, respective ones of electrical conductors of the two groups of electrical conductors being connected together at abutting regions intermediate the ends of the printhead assembly.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printed assembly, comprising: a printhead module including at least two printhead integrated circuits, each printhead integrated circuit having nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto print media fed past the printhead assembly in a media feed direction, a support member supporting and carrying the printing fluid and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits; first and second power supplies, the first power supply being provided at a first end of the printhead assembly, and the second power supply being provided at a second end of the printhead assembly oppostite to the first end; and a plurality of electrical conductors for providing power to the at least two printhead integrated circuits from the first and second power supplies, the plurality of electrical conductors extending transverse to the media feed direction and arranged as first and second groups of electrical conductors, wherein the first and second groups of electrical conductors have combined lengths at least equal to the media feed path length, the first group is connected to the first power supply an extends from the first end of the printhead assembly to a region intermediate the ends of the printhead assembly, and the second group is connected to the second power supply and extends from the second end to connect to the first group at the region intermediate the first and second ends of the printhead assembly to supply power in parallel from both ends of the printhead assembly. 2. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, further comprising a casing in which the at least one printhead module and the plurality of electrical conductors are removably mounted. 3. A printhead assembly according to claim 2, further comprising drive electronics incorporating at least one controller for controlling the printing operation of at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits via the electrical connector, wherein power is provided to the drive electronics by the electrical conductors via the electrical connector. 4. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein the first group of electrical conductors and the second group of electrical conductors overlap each other in the region intermediate the ends of the printhead assembly. 5. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein: the at least module is formed as a unitary arrangement of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, the support member, the electrical connector, and at least one fluid distribution member mounting the at least two printhead integrated circuits to the support member; and the support member has at least one longitudinally extending channel for carrying the printing fluid for the printhead integrated circuits and includes a plurality of apertures extending through a wall of the support member arranged so as to direct the printing fluid from the at least one channel to associated nozzles in both, or if more than two, all of the printhead integrated circuits by way of respective ones of the fluid distribution members.
