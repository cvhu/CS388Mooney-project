A automation equipment control system comprises a general purpose computer with a general purpose operating system in electronic communication with a real-time computer subsystem. The general purpose computer includes a program execution module to selectively start and stop processing of a program of equipment instructions and to generate a plurality of move commands. The real-time computer subsystem includes a move command data buffer for storing the plurality of move commands, a move module linked to the data buffer for sequentially processing the moves and calculating a required position for a mechanical joint. The real-time computer subsystem also includes a dynamic control algorithm in software communication with the move module to repeatedly calculate a required actuator activation signal from a joint position feedback signal.
Claims I claim: 1. A control system suitable for controlling automation equipment of different electromechanical configurations, the control system comprising: an equipment-independent computer unit including a video display and a first digital processor for running an operator interface module for creating a move command; and an equipment-specific controller unit operably linked to the automation equipment and including a move module for executing said move command, said equipment-specific controller unit being in direct electronic communication with said equipment-independent computer unit. 2. The control system according to claim 1 wherein said equipment-independent computer unit and said equipment-specific controller unit are operably linked to one another electronically by a data bus.
