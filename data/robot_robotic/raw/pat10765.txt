A dual forearmed robotic elbow configuration comprises a main arm having a double elbow from which two coplanar forearms depend, two actuators carried in the double elbow for moving the forearms, and separate, independent end effectors, operated by a cable carried from the main arm through the elbow, is attached to the distal end of each forearm. Coiling the cables around the actuators prevents bending or kinking when the forearms are rotated 360 degrees. The end effectors can have similar or different capabilities. Actuator cannisters within the dual elbow are modular for rapid replacement or maintenance. Coarse and fine resolver transducers within the actuators provide accurate position referencing information.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic elbow configuration apparatus comprising: a main arm having a first side and an opposing side; an upper forearm rotatably attached for support to said first side of said main arm and adapted to rotate coplanarly with said main arm; a lower forearm rotatably attached to said opposing side of said main arm and adapted to rotate coplanarly with said main arm and said upper forearm, said lower forearm capable of movement and operating independent of said upper forearm; a first modular actuator assembly carried by said upper forearm for moving said upper forearm; and a second modular actuator assembly having the same structure as said first modular actuator assembly carried by said lower forearm for moving said lower forearm; each of said first and second modular actuator assemblies comprising: an actuator canister within said modular actuator assembly having a motor means; a shaft means turned by said motor means; a gearing means in operative connection with said shaft means; a position referencing means in operative connection with said shaft means for determining position; a spindle within said modular actuator assembly for receiving said actuator canister having a bearing means on which bearing means said actuator assembly rotates; and an output hub means in operative connection with said gearing means for moving a forearm attached to said actuator assembly. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said position referencing means further comprises a coarse resolver transducer and a fine resolver transducer, said coarse resolver transducer in operative connection with said output hub and producing a first output, said fine resolver transducer in operative connection with said shaft means and producing a second output, so that said first and second outputs can be combined algorithmically to determine the position of said attached forearm.
