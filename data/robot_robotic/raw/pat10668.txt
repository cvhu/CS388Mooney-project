In order to facilitate rapid automatic set up and adjustment of a robotic assembly arrangement in a manner which produces the required precision, pre-recorded data and expert system software are teamed together and used to set robotic support jigs and move panels into position against the body they are to be attached to. The position of the panels is determined using a laser scanning technique and feedback control used to adjust the robots and associated hardware and move the panel or panels in the case there is a deviation beyond acceptable tolerances in a manner which either reduces or eliminates the deviation.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An assembly arrangement wherein a plurality of work pieces are to be connected with a given degree of precision to a structure, comprising: means for determining a position in which each of said plurality of work pieces should be connected relative to said structure using pre-recorded data which relates to the design of said structure; work support means for supporting and moving each of said plurality of work pieces into its determined position relative to said structure; means for determining a correct position for each of a plurality of reference points defined on each of said plurality of work pieces using said pre-recorded structure design data; structure measuring means for determining an actual position for each among said plurality of reference points; means for determining the deviation between the actual position and the correct position for each of said reference points while each of said work pieces are supported in situ; a memory bank, said memory bank containing said pre-recorded data and an inference means, wherein said inference means is used in combination with said pre-recorded data to determine correction values for correcting any deviations which are in excess of predetermined tolerances in a manner which reduces or eliminates the deviations; and means for fixing said work pieces to said body when the deviations between the correct and actual reference points are within said predetermined tolerances. 2. In a method of assembling a structure wherein a plurality of work pieces are connected with a given degree of precision, to a structure the steps of; determining a position in which said plurality of work pieces should be disposed relative to a body forming part of said structure using pre-recorded data which related to the design of said structure; using work support means to support and move said plurality of work pieces into the determined positions relative to said body; determining a correct position for each of a plurality of reference points defined on each of said plurality of work pieces, using said pre-recorded data; determining an actual position for each of said plurality of reference points using structure measuring means; determining the deviation between each of the actual positions and the correct positions of each of said reference points after each of said work pieces have been moved into said determined position; using a memory bank which contains said pre-recorded moved into said determined positions; using a memory bank which contains said pre-recorded data and an inference means wherein said inference means is used in combination with the pre-recorded data to determine correction values for correcting any deviations which are in excess of predetermined tolerances in a manner which reduces or eliminates the differences; and fixing said work pieces to said body when the deviations between the correct and actual reference points are within said predetermined tolerances. 3.
