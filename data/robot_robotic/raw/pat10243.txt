Claims It is claimed: 1. An automated apparatus for use in cleaving, deprotecting and purifying polymers prepared by FMOC chemistry, and immobilized on solid phase particles in a particle suspension, said apparatus comprising, in operative condition: (a) a cleavage vessel having a first opening for receiving the particle suspension and a second opening fitted with a filter through which a gas may pass into said vessel to produce mixing of the suspension by bubbling and through which a solution containing polypeptides may pass out said vessel with retention of said solid phase particles; (b) means for delivering a gas into said cleavage vessel through the second opening; (c) an extraction vessel having an open end, a closed end defining a reservoir, and a side arm located between the two ends of the extraction vessel; (d) transfer means for transferring a polypeptide solution produced by cleavage of said polymers from said solid-phase particles from said cleavage vessel to said extraction vessel; (e) means for delivering a dispersion of a water-immiscible extracting solvent into polypeptide solution contained in the reservoir of said extraction vessel, with excess solvent in the extraction vessel being removed by overflow into the vessel's side arm; and (f) control means operatively connected to said gas-delivering means, said transfer means, and said solvent-delivering means, to effect (i) bubbling of gas through the particle suspension in said cleavage vessel, (ii) transfer of peptide solution from the cleavage to the extraction vessel, and (iii) delivery of a water-immiscible solvent through the polypeptide solution into the extraction vessel. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said transfer means further includes means for transferring the particle suspension into the cleavage vessel, and means for transferring predetermined reagent solutions into said cleavage vessel. 3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the transfer means is a robotic arm. 4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the transfer means includes a spigot connected to said robotic arm, said spigot comprising: (a) a resilient plug having a first end and tapered to a second end having a foam disposed circumferentially along the edge of the second end, said plug proportioned for air-tight receipt within the first opening of said cleavage vessel; (b) a spring-loaded, telescoping member connected to said first end of said plug; and (c) tube means passing through said telescoping member and said resilient plug, said tube means capable of selective delivery of one of several desired reagents. 5. An automated apparatus for use in cleaving, deprotecting and purifying polymers prepared by FMOC chemistry, and immobilized on solid phase particles in a particle suspension, said apparatus comprising, in operative condition: (a) a cleavage vessel having a first opening for receiving the particle suspension and a second opening fitted with a filter through which a gas may pass into said vessel to produce mixing of the suspension by bubbling and through which a solution containing polypeptides may pass out said vessel with retention of said solid phase particles; (b) means for delivering a gas into said cleavage vessel through the second opening; (c) an extraction vessel having an open end, a closed end defining a reservoir, and a side arm located between the two ends of the extraction vessel; (d) transfer means for transferring a polypeptide solution produced by cleavage of said polymers from said solid-phase particles from said cleavage vessel to said extraction vessel, said transfer means including means for transferring the particle suspension into the cleavage vessel, and means for transferring predetermined reagent solutions into said cleavage vessel, said transfer means including a robotic arm and a spigot connected to said robotic arm, said spigot comprising (i) a resilient plug having a first end and tapered to a second end having a foam disposed circumferentially along the edge of the second end, said plug proportioned for air-tight receipt within the first opening of said cleavage vessel; (ii) a spring-loaded, telescoping member connected to said first end of said plug; and (iii) tube means passing through said telescoping member and said resilient plug, said tube means capable of selective delivery of one of several desired reagents; (e) means for delivering a dispersion of a water-immiscible extracting solvent into polypeptide solution contained in the reservoir of said extraction vessel, with excess solvent in the extraction vessel being removed by overflow into the vessel's side arm; and (f) control means operatively connected to said gas-delivering means, said transfer means, and said solvent-delivering means, to effect (i) bubbling of gas through the particle suspension in said cleavage vessel, (ii) transfer of peptide solution from the cleavage to the extraction vessel, and (iii) delivery of a water-immiscible solvent through the polypeptide solution into the extraction vessel.
