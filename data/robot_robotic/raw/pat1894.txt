A system is provided for storing knowledge, information and data (KID). The system includes a plurality of sources of KID, at least one receiver of KID from the plurality of sources, a universal knowledge, information and data store and an interface coupling the receiver and the UKIDS. The interface provides a plurality of logical partitions for storing KID within the UKIDS. In one embodiment, a first level of the logical partitions segregates information into personal and professional KID. A plurality of second personal levels under the first personal level segregates KID storage into a teams of people subset, an activities and organization subset and an organization and administration subset. A plurality of second professional levels under said first professional level segregates KID storage into a clients subset, an output subset, a teams subset and an administration subset.
