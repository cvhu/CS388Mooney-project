A digital robot control is provided with position/velocity and torque control loops with microprocessor servo controllers in each. The position/velocity servo controller includes two microprocessors that operate as a servo engine in providing position/velocity control for six robot axes. One microprocessor operates as a manager to perform data processing and coordination tasks supportive to position/velocity control. The other microprocessor performs position and velocity servo calculation tasks and operates as a slave processor to the position/velocity control manager. The programming for the position/velocity control sends manager position and other commands and position and velocity feedback from other control levels to the position/velocity calculator and sends torque commands received from the calculator to the next lower control level. The calculator employs position/velocity control algorithms in making torque command calculations.
