Provided herein are methods for the in vitro maintenance, expansion, culture, and/or differentiation of pluripotent cells, such as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) or induced pluripotent cells (iPSC), into hematopoietic precursor cells or endothelial cells. The pluripotent cells may be maintained and differentiated under defined conditions; thus, the use of mouse feeder cells or serum is not required in certain embodiments for the differentiation of the pluripotent cells into hematopoietic precursor cells or endothelial cells. The resulting hematopoietic precursor cells may be further differentiated into various myeloid or lymphoid lineages.
