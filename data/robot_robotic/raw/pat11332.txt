A hazardous material handling apparatus capable of being remotely controlled so as to allow the operator to safely handle hazardous materials. The apparatus utilizes electric motors in order to provide for three-dimensional movement of the gripper. A television camera and remotely located television monitor may be utilized in order to facilitate remote control of the apparatus. A manually operated gripper is provided to allow for simple and inexpensive construction.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A remote control hazardous material handling device comprising: a movable base: an upstanding support pivotally secured to said base; a vertically adjustable support arm mounted on said upstanding support and extending generally horizontally therefrom; a horizontally adjustable gripper mounted on said support arm and comprising an adjustable closed-loop cable extending from diverging ends of a Y-shaped conduit; a first electric motor and drive means operatively associated with said support arm for vertically motivating said arm; a second electric motor and drive means operatively associated with said gripper for horizontally motivating said gripper; a third electric motor and drive means operatively associated with said upstanding support for pivotally motivating said support; a first remote control means electrically connected to said electric motors for controlling said motors from a remote location; and a second remote control means operatively associated with said gripper for controlling engagement and disengagement of the hazardous material by said gripper. 2. A remote control hazardous material handling device comprising: a movable base having rollers secured thereto; an upstanding support pivotally secured to said base; a vertically adjustable support arm mounted on said upstanding support and extending generally horizontally therefrom; a horizontally adjustable gripper mounted on said support arm and comprising an adjustable closed-loop cable extending from diverging ends of a Y-shaped conduit; a first reversible electric motor and mechanically cooperating worm drive operatively associated with said support arm for vertically motivating said arm; a second reversible electric motor and mechanically cooperating worm drive operatively associated with said gripper for horizontally motivating said gripper; a third reversible electric motor and mechanically cooperating sprocket and chain drive operatively associated with said upstanding support for pivotally motivating said upstanding support; a first remote control comprising switches electrically connected with each of said electric motors for independently controlling the rotational direction and speed thereof; a second remote control operatively associated with said gripper for controlling engagement and disengagement of the hazardous material by said gripper; and a closed circuit television system comprising a camera associated with said material handling device so as to generally focus on said gripper and hazardous material and an electrically connected television monitor for facilitating use of said first and second remote controls. 3. A remote control hazardous material handling device comprising: a movable base; an upstanding support pivotally secured to said base; a vertically adjustable support arm mounted on said upstanding support and extending generally horizontally therefrom; a horizontally adjustable gripper mounted on said support arm and comprising an adjustable closed-loop cable extending from diverging ends of a Y-shaped conduit; a first electric motor and drive means operatively associated with said support arm for vertically motivating said arm; a second electric motor and drive means operatively associated with said gripper for horizontally motivating said gripper; a third electric motor and drive means operatively associated with said upstanding support for pivotally motivating said support; a first remote control means electrically connected to said electric motors for controlling said motors from a remote location; and a second remote control means operatively associated with said gripper for controlling engagement and disengagement of the hazardous material by said gripper and comprising a coaxial cable with the inner cable forming said closed-loop cable at one end thereof and the other end thereof including an adjustment means for opening and closing said closed-loop cable. 4. A remote control hazardous material handling device comprising: a movable base having rollers secured thereto; an upstanding support pivotally secured to said base; a vertically adjustable support arm mounted on said upstanding support and extending generally horizontally therefrom; a horizontally adjustable gripper mounted on said support arm and comprising an adjustable closed-loop cable extending from diverging ends of a Y-shaped conduit, said Y shaped conduit having resilient padding secured thereto; a first reversible electric motor and mechanically cooperating worm drive operatively associated with said support arm for vertically motivating said support arm; a second reversible electric motor and mechanically cooperating worm drive operatively associated with said gripper for horizontally motivating said gripper; a third reversible electric motor and mechanically cooperating sprocket and chain drive operatively associated with said upstanding support for pivotally motivating said upstanding support; a first remote control comprising switches electrically connected with each of said electric motors for independently controlling the rotational direction and speed thereof; a second remote control operatively associated with said gripper for controlling engagement and disengagement of the hazardous material by said gripper and comprising a coaxial cable with the inner cable forming said closed-loop cable at one end thereof and the other end thereof including an adjustment means for opening and closing said closed-loop cable.
