A space frame constructed from a plurality of identical struts using octahedron/tetrahedron ("octet") geometry wherein the struts, instead of being simple tubular members, are fabricated as space frame masts using octet geometry. A second aspect of the invention concerns a connector piece for orienting and joining the ends of struts to form octet structures. In one embodiment, the connector piece is in the shape of two interpenetrating tetrahedrons, allowing assembly and disassembly of individual struts without disturbing other struts. Retaining means are described which do not require tools for assembly.
Claims I claim: 1. A connector/strut assembly for use in an octet space frame which comprises: (a) a connector piece having twelve pairs of faces for orienting struts, each of said faces being at least a portion of one face of a geometric shape formed by two interpenetrating tetrahedrons; (b) an elongate strut having a body portion and two end portions, each end portion having two place surfaces adapted to mate with one of said pairs of faces for orienting said strut with respect to said connector piece; and (c) attaching means for attaching one end of said strut to said connector piece, said attaching means including an interlocking slide and a spring catch.
