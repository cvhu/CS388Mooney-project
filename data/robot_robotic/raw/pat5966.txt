A robot controller for teaching a robot with high efficiency. The robot controller including command storage unit (21) where a movement command and a work command are stored, command identifying unit (24) for discriminating between the movement and work commands, unit (22) for making/editing a series of work programs or discrete work programs by a combination of the commands, work program storage units (23) where the work programs are stored so as to control the robot according to the stored program, further including a work section identifying unit (25) for identifying a work section of the work program by way of the command identification unit (24) and work section automatic stopping unit (27) for automatically stopping or suspending the execution of the work program at the work section in a standby state when the work section identifying unit (25) identifies the work section during the execution of the work program.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot controller comprising: command storage means for storing a movement command and a work command in advance; command identifying means for discriminating said movement command from said work command; means for preparing and editing a series of commands or discrete commands by a combination of said commands; and work program storage means for storing the work programs that are prepared and edited in the above, wherein the robot controller is actuated by said stored work programs; and further comprising: work section identifying means for discriminating work sections of said work programs by said command identifying means; and work section automatic means for automatically stopping or suspending the execution of said work programs in said work section where a specified work section is identified by said work section identifying means during the execution of said work programs; wherein said work section identifying means identifies that at least one movement command section existing between a work start command and a work termination command among the work commands discriminated by said command identifying means, is respectively, an independent work section. 2. A robot controller comprising: command storage means for storing a movement command and a work command in advance; command identifying means for discriminating said movement command from said work command; means for preparing and editing a series of commands or discrete commands by a combination of said commands; and work program storage means for storing the work programs that are prepared and edited in the above, wherein the robot controller is actuated by said stored work programs; and further comprising: work section identifying means for discriminating work sections of said work programs by said command identifying means; and work section automatic stopping means for automatically stopping or suspending the execution of said work programs in said work section where a specified work section is identified by said work section identifying means during the execution of said work programs; wherein said work section identifying means identifies that at least one movement command section existing between a work start command and a work termination command among the work commands discriminated by said command identifying means is a work section. 3. A robot controller comprising: command storage means for storing a movement command and a work command in advance; command identifying means for discriminating said movement command from said work command; means for preparing and editing a series of commands or discrete commands by a combination of said commands; and work program storage means for storing the work programs that are prepared and edited in the above, wherein the robot controller is actuated by said stored work programs; and further comprising: work section identifying means for discriminating work sections of said work programs by said command identifying means; and work section automatic means for automatically stopping or suspending the execution of said work programs in said work section where a specified work section is identified by said work section identifying means during the execution of said work programs; wherein said work section automatic stopping means automatically stops or suspends at the start position and/or termination position of the work section discriminated by said work section identifying means. 4. A robot controller comprising: command storage means for storing a movement command and work command in advance; command identifying means for discriminating said movement command from said work command, means for preparing and editing a series of commands or discrete commands by a combination of said commands; and work program storage means for storing the work programs that are prepared and edited in the above, wherein the robot controller is actuated by said stored work programs; and further comprising: section identifying means for identifying a movement section and a work section for said work programs by said command identifying means; section selecting means for selecting an optional section; and section automatic stopping means that consecutively moves in compliance with a movement command without executing any work command until reaching the section selected by said section selecting means and automatically stopping or suspending a movement of said work program in a section selected by said section selecting means, wherein the robot is consecutively or intermittently moved after the same stops or suspends by said section automatic stopping means. 5. The robot controller according to claim 4, wherein said section identifying means identifies at least one movement command section existing between a work start command and a work termination command among the work commands identified by said command identifying means as one work section. 6. The robot controller according to claim 4, wherein said section selecting means can set and store at least one optical section during the preparation and editing of a program. 7. The robot controller according to claim 4, wherein said section automatic stopping means can automatically stop or suspend at the start position or termination position of a section selected by said section selection means. 8. The robot controlled according to claim 4, wherein said section automatic stopping means can automatically stop or suspended at work command point incidental to the start position or termination position of a section selected by said section selecting means. 9. The robot controller according to claim 4, wherein said section automatic stopping means compares a section selected by said section selecting means with the entire movement start sections of the work programs and the entire movement termination sections thereof, operates in the forward direction of backward direction from the movement start position close to the selected section or from the entire movement termination position, and automatically stops or suspends at the start position or termination position of said selected section. 10. A robot controller, which is controlled by work programs in which a series of robot movement commands and welding work commands are described, comprising: means for identifying welding work sections of said work programs: means for sequentially storing welding work sections identified by said work section identifying means: means for storing welding work conditions per work section which are stored by said work section storing means; means for calculating work movement information per welding work section which is stored by said work section storing means; means for storing work movement information calculated by said movement information calculating means; and means for processing information, which is stored in said work section storing means, said work condition storing means, and said work movement information storing means, to obtain work information for respective welding work sections; wherein said welding work conditions are a welding current command value, a welding voltage command value, welding speed, a plate thickness of a workpiece to be welded, a profile of a joint, and a type of sealing gas, said work movement information is work time, work section length, and type of movement interpolation, said work information is work time, work section length, and type of movement interpolation, said work information includes a movement locus of a robot, an actually measured value of the welding voltage, an actually measured value of the welding current, and the results of a welding work, and further comprises means for displaying, in a unit of said work program, said welding work conditions or said work information together with said movement locus which is graphically displayed.
