A method and system for sharing robotic mechanisms between physically remote storage libraries in an automated storage library system includes routing robotic mechanism guide structures between the storage libraries. The guide structures run through robotic mechanism transfer ports located on the sides of the housing enclosures of the storage libraries. A robotic mechanism within an first storage library moves through the transfer port of the enclosure of the first storage library onto the guide structure. The robotic mechanism then moves out of the enclosure of the first storage library along the guide structure towards a second storage library. The robotic mechanism then moves along the guide structure through the transfer port of the enclosure of the second storage library and into the second storage library for performing operations such as accessing media objects within the second storage library.
