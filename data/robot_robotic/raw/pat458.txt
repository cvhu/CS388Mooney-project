An article configuration system according to claim 1 wherein the transferring mechanism is operable to lift a number of articles in a group configured to have a transverse number of articles by longitudinal number of articles of N by W and transferring and manipulating said group to said second conveyor such that said number of articles is deposited on said second conveyor in a group configured to have a transverse number of articles by longitudinal number of articles of W by N, wherein N and W are each integer numbers and wherein W is greater than N. 3. An article configuration system according to claim 2 wherein N=2 and W=6. 4. An article configuration system according to claim 1, comprising a rearranging mechanism disposed downstream of said mechanism for transferring articles, said rearranging mechanism operable to lift, relocate and deposit one or more articles thereby to rearrange said articles disposed in a greater number of adjacent metered lanes conveyed by said second conveyor into an outgoing stream of articles having a different configuration. 5. An article processing system comprising a primary conveyor structured and arranged to deliver articles in a stream from an outfeed of a primary processor to one or more secondary processing devices, each of said secondary processing devices comprising a means for metering and configuring articles such that a metered and configured stream of articles is produced by the or each secondary processing device, wherein the or each secondary processing devices comprises an article configuration system according to claim 1, further comprising an apparatus suitable for metering a stream of articles, and comprising a series of regularly positioned lugs, each lug having a leading and trailing edge which leading and trailing edges are tapered with respect to one another and the spacing between articles metered by the apparatus is adjustable by means for altering the extent to which each tapered lug is inserted into an article stream. 6. A transfer device according to claim 1, wherein the drive means for each independent arm is affixed to each independent arm and moves with said independent arm. 7. A transfer device according to claim 6 wherein each element for releasably gripping articles is mounted to an independent arm by means of a first moveable mount coupled to a first guide path, which first guide path is structured and arranged to control the position of said first moveable mount in a first dimension or plane relative to said independent arm and thereby control the position of said element at and between each of said first and second positions. 8. A transfer device according to claim 1, wherein the independently controllable drive means of each arm are operable to drive an element alongside adjacent lanes of articles conveyed by a first conveyor at the same speed as a first conveyor and operable to drive that element alongside adjacent lanes of a second conveyor at the same speed as that second conveyor. 9. A transfer device according to claim 8 wherein between matching the speed of a first conveyor and matching the speed of a second conveyor the controllable drive means is operable to drive the element at an appropriate angular velocity such that the element arrives at the second conveyor in alignment with lanes of that second conveyor and matches the speed of that second conveyor. 10. A transfer device according to claim 1, wherein each element comprises an array of gripping tools, each gripping tool for releasably holding an article, wherein each gripping tool of the array of gripping tools are mounted to the element such that they are each moveable relative to one another for adjusting the relative spacing of articles picked up and placed by the tool head. 11. A transfer device according to claim 1 for use with a second conveyor comprising a series of moveable transverse dividers, wherein the transfer mechanism is operable to deposit a first part of a single group of articles on one side of said moving transverse divider and to deposit a second part of that single group of articles on the other side of said transverse divider. 12. A rearranging mechanism for use in the article configuration system of claim 1, the rearranging mechanism operable to act on an incoming moving stream of articles, the rearranging mechanism having one or more tools operable to grasp one or more articles simultaneously and said one or more tools moveable relative to said incoming moving stream of articles such that said tools are operable to match the velocity of the moving stream for gripping and lifting articles at a first loading position; operable to match the velocity of the moving stream at a second spaced unloading position, and operable to change velocity and/or position upstream or downstream relative to the moving articles and/or transverse position relative to the moving articles such that said second position is spaced longitudinally and/or transversely relative to said first position and thereby the rearranging mechanism is operable to rearrange an incoming stream of articles into an outgoing stream of articles in spaced groups having a different configuration relative to that of the incoming stream of articles. 13. An article configuration system comprising a first conveyor for transferring articles from an input and a second conveyor, disposed at a non-linear angle relative to the first conveyor, for transferring articles to an output, the article processing system comprising a mechanism for transferring articles from the first conveyor to the second conveyor, said mechanism being structured and arranged to facilitate the reorganisation of articles conveyed by the first conveyor such that when transferred to the second conveyor the articles are disposed in adjacent metered lanes wherein the number of adjacent metered lanes of articles conveyed by the second conveyor is greater than the number of adjacent lanes of articles conveyed by the first conveyor, the mechanism for transferring articles comprising one or more elements each structured and arranged for releasably gripping articles in a configured group for transferring configured groups of articles from a first position to a second position, each of said elements being moveable between the first and second positions independently with respect to other of said elements such that each element is moveable at variable angular velocity between said first and second positions, said apparatus being suitable for metering a stream of articles, and comprising a series of regularly positioned lugs, each lug having a leading and trailing edge which leading and trailing edges are tapered with respect to one another and the spacing between articles metered by the apparatus is adjustable by means for altering the extent to which each tapered lug is inserted into an article stream. 14. Apparatus according to claim 13 comprising an endless conveyor for holding the series of regularly positioned lugs, the endless conveyor comprising a working reach for conveying articles at regular pitch by means of the regularly positioned lugs being disposed between adjacent articles, said leading and trailing edges being shaped such that the width of the lug increases from a tip of the lug furthest from the endless conveyor to a rear of the lug closest to the endless conveyor, the lugs being arranged such that by adjusting the position of the lugs relative to a stream of articles being metered, each lug provides a greater or lesser spacer between adjacent articles and thereby the apparatus is adaptable to meter a first stream of articles having a first width and subsequently, a second stream of articles having a second different width, at the same regular pitch.
