An automated archiving and retrieval system for computer tape cassettes includes at least one tape storage facility for storing a number of computer cassettes during periods of non-use, and at least one pair of tape drive sections. Each of the tape drive sections is positioned on a respective lateral side of the tape storage facility in spaced relationship therewith. A pair of robot transports is therefore capable of operating in a respective one of these defined spaces so as to transport tape cassettes between the tape storage facility and its respective tape drive sections.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for storing computer tape cassettes and for transporting said cassettes between a storage location and a tape drive, said system comprising: at least one tape storage facility for storing a number of said computer tape cassettes during periods of non-use; first and second tape drive sections each having at least one tape drive for accepting a preselected one of said tape cassettes therein, said first tape drive section being positioned on one lateral side of said tape storage facility so as to define a first space therebetween, and said second tape drive section being positioned on another lateral side of said tape storage facility opposite to said one lateral side so as to define a second space therebetween; first and second robot transport means respectively movable along first and second substantially horizontal paths disposed within said first and second defined spaces between said storage facility and said first and second tape drive sections, whereby selected ones of said computer tape cassettes may be retrieved form said storage facility and inserted into said tape drive of said first and second tape drive sections, and wherein said storage facility includes a number of tape storage carousels, each said storage carousel including means for mounting said carousels for rotational movements about a substantially vertical axis, and wherein said number of tape storage carousels are aligned along a horizontal axis substantially parallel to said first and second paths of said first and second robot transport means, respectively. 2. A system as in claim 1, wherein each of said first and second robot transport means includes: pairs of parallel track members which define said first and second paths; first and second carriage means coupled to a respective pair of said track members for reciprocal movements along said defined path between forwardmost and rearwardmost positions relative to said storage facility; and motive means for moving said first and second carriage means along said respective pair of track members. 3. An automated computer tape cassette archiving system comprising: a tape cassette storage facility adapted to store a plurality of individual tape cassettes during periods of non-use; first and second tape drive units each disposed in relation to said tape cassette storage facility on a respective lateral side thereof so as to establish first and second spaces therebetween; first and second pairs of track means each extending essentially parallel to one another within said established first and second spaces to provide first and second conveyance paths, respectively; and first and second pairs of robot transport means operatively associated with said first and second pairs of track means and movable along said first and second conveyance paths within said established first and second spaces, respectively; wherein said tape storage facility includes a number of tape storage carousels, each including means for mounting said carousels for rotational movements about a substantially vertical axis, and wherein said number of tape storage carousels are aligned along a horizontal axis substantially parallel to said first and second paris of track means. 4. A fully automated system for archiving and retrieving data storage cassettes comprising: a storage facility having cassette compartments for data storage cassettes, said storage facility having at least two revolving units which are movable independently of one another and which contain said cassette compartments, all said cassette compartments being movable into both a first robot access position and a second robot access position by moving the respective revolving units, said first robot access position and said second robot access position being arranged essentially on opposite sides of said revolving storage facility; first and second tracks arranged substantially parallel to one another alongside said cassette storage facility; first and second robots respectively movable along said first and second tracks; and at least first and second cassette drive units located alongside said first and second tracks and exclusively associated with said first and second robots, respectively; (i) said first and second robots for transporting said data storage cassettes between said storage facility and a respective one of said first and second cassette drive units exclusively associated therewith; (ii) said first robot being movable between said first robot access position and said respective first cassette drive unit along said first track; (iii) said second robot being movable between said second robot access position and said respective second cassette drive unit along said second track; and wherein (iv) each one of said first and second robots have a zone of activity which does not overlap the zone of activity of the other of said first and second robots.
