A robotic vehicle is provided with an elliptical shaped housing, the housing having a circumferential track disposed about its midsection. The circumferential track is driven by a prime mover to rotate the housing and move it over a variety of different terrains. The vehicle is adapted to carry weapons systems for military application.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic weapons platform comprising: an elliptical housing, the housing having a major and minor axis, the elliptical housing being disposed so as to rotate about its major axis; a continuous circumferential track disposed about a midsection of the elliptical housing coaxial with the major axis of the elliptical housing, the circumferential track having a ground gripping texture on its outer surface; an axle located on the major axis of the elliptical housing, the axle being journaled with the housing to allow the housing and axle to rotate freely with respect to each other; a prime mover for furnishing power to move the elliptical housing and operate all ancillary functions of the system, the prime mover being suspended from the axle to a position below the axle with respect to the ground; a power transmission system having a first, drive gear powered by the prime mover, and a second larger, internally toothed gear engaging the teeth of the drive gear to form an internal spur gear drive; a compressed gas steering system located within the housing, the compressed gas system having a compressor powered by the prime mover, the compressor being fluidly connected to a gas storage tank with a gas delivery system fluidly connected to the gas storage tank, the system having valving which controls the flow of gas to a pair of jet nozzles located on both ends of the axle, the nozzles being moveable to direct a jet flows so as to provide steering function to the elliptical housing; braking members associated with the axle, the braking members being engageable in response to operator commands to hold the elliptical housing stable; a weapons system journaled on the axle, the weapons system having a platform located above the elliptical housing with respect to the ground, the platform supporting sensing means capable of determining the terrain and locating possible military targets within a range of the robot; a targeting sensor for locating and ranging a military target; weapons pods mounted on the ends of the axle, the weapons pods having an associated positioning motor that can rotate the weapons pod about the axis of the axle to the desired orientation; counterweight shells attached to the weapons system on a side of the axle opposite the weapons platform, the counterweight shells being adapted to carry at least a portion of the electronic systems required by the robot, and further having a quantity of liquid therein to provide adjustable ballast counterweights; a liquid movement system including a pump and valves responsive to signals from control means to move liquid between the counterweight shells so as to change the balance of the elliptical housing and thereby the direction of travel of the robot.
