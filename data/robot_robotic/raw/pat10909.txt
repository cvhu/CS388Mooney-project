Method and apparatus for positioning a three-dimensional object at a preselected position within a workstation. An optical system in the apparatus creates a 3-dimensional image of the object at the selected preselected position. An imaging device in the apparatus detects macroscopic features related to the extent of volume overlap between the object and image, and this information is used to direct the object, through a mechanical drive, toward a position of greater volume overlap with the image. In one aspect of the invention, the optical system produces a holographic image, and the imaging device is designed to detect both macroscopic features related to volume overlap, and interference fringes which form when the volume overlap between the image and object is within about 50 microns, providing object positioning to within about 50 microns. The apparatus may further include a system for analyzing the interference fringes, to determine the direction of object movement which increases fringe spacing, allowing volume overlap down to 1-3 microns or less.
