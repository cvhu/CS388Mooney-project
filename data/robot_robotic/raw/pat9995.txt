The present invention relates to an integrated analytical system which includes a plurality of remote laboratories and a central monitoring station. The remote laboratories include a specimen analysis member and a plurality of peripheral devices. The central monitoring station includes a computer for controlling predetermined functions of the peripheral devices. A local area network provides communication between each of the remote laboratories and the central monitoring station. A computer interface provides bi-directional communication between analytical instruments, robots and peripheral devices and a computer. The system employs a robot which is responsive to computer commands and capable of performing mechanical functions. The mechanical functions include manipulating an analytical instrument, transporting the specimens to be analyzed through a variety of locations, and the manipulation of the container in which the specimen is housed.
