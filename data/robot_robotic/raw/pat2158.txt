A minimally invasive surgical system includes a pair of surgical instruments having end effectors to hold and suture tissue, a pair of robotic arms coupled to the surgical instruments, a controller, and a pair of master handles coupled through the controller to the robotic arms, so that surgeon manipulation of the handles produces corresponding movement of the end effectors in an adjustably scaled fashion. An input button allows the surgeon to adjust the position of the handles without moving the end effectors, so that the handles may be moved to a more comfortable position. An optionally included robotically controlled endoscope allows the surgeon to remotely view the surgical site. Using the system, a cardiac procedure can be performed by making small incisions in the patient's skin, inserting the instruments and endoscope through the incisions, and manipulating the handles to move the end effectors to perform the cardiac procedure.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A medical robotic system comprising: a robotic arm; a surgical instrument detachably coupled to the robotic arm; a master input device; and a controller coupled to the master input device, the robotic arm, and the surgical instrument so as to translate movement of the master input device into corresponding movement of the surgical instrument according to a master-slave relationship, wherein the controller has a filter that filters a portion of an output of the master input device that corresponds to a hand tremor of an operator manipulating the master input device. 2. A medical robotic system comprising: a plurality of robotic arms individually having a plurality of slave joints providing first multiple degrees of freedom of movement; a plurality of master input devices individually having a plurality of master joints providing second multiple degrees of freedom of movement; and a controller coupled to the plurality of robotic arms and the plurality of master input devices and configured so as to translate movement of the plurality of master input devices to corresponding movements of the plurality of robotic arms in master-slave relationships, wherein the controller has a filter that filters a portion of an output of one of the plurality of master input devices that corresponds to a hand tremor of an operator manipulating the master input device. 3. A medical robotic system comprising: first, second and third robotic arms respectively coupled to a first surgical instrument, a second surgical instrument, and an endoscope; first, second and third master input devices respectively associated with the first, second and third robotic arms; and a controller coupled to the first, second and third robotic arms and the first, second and third master input devices and configured so as to translate manipulations of the master input devices to corresponding movements of the robotic arms for performing a minimally invasive surgical procedure, wherein the controller has a filter that filters a portion of an output of the first master input device that corresponds to a hand tremor of an operator manipulating the first master input device. 4. A medical robotic system comprising: a robotic arm; a surgical instrument coupled to the robotic arm; a master input device; and a controller coupled to the master input device, the robotic arm, and the surgical instrument so as to translate movement of the master input device into corresponding movement of the surgical instrument according to a master-slave relationship while filtering a portion of an output of the master input device that corresponds to a hand tremor of an operator manipulating the master input device.
