An omni-directional robot cleaner, composed of a platform and a plurality of driving units for driving and controlling the movement of the platform, in which the platform further comprises: a sensing unit, for obstacle detection; a cleaning unit, for collecting and removing dust and dirt; a processing unit, capable of receiving signals transmitted from the sensing unit while planning and mapping a travel path accordingly; and a power unit, for providing power to the omni-directional robot cleaner while managing the same. Moreover, each driving unit of the plural driving units is comprised of an omni-directional wheel and an actuator for driving the corresponding omni-directional wheel to rotate omni-directionally, by which the platform is enabled to move continuously while changing its moving direction simultaneously so as to free the robotic cleaner from the shortcomings of those conventional autonomous cleaner, such as poor maneuverability, poor mobility and insufficient degree-of-freedom regarding to the driving of the cleaner. Therefore, not only the operation mobility of the robotic cleaner is enhanced, but also the moving agility of the same is greatly improved.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An omni-directional robot cleaner, comprising: a sensing unit, for obstacle detection; a cleaning unit, for collecting and removing dust and dirt; a processing unit, capable of receiving signals transmitted from the sensing unit while planning and mapping a travel path accordingly; a power unit, for providing power to the omni-directional robot cleaner while managing the same; a platform, for supporting the aforesaid units; and at least three driving units are configured in the omni-directional robot cleaner, for driving and controlling the movement of the platform, each being composed of an omni-directional wheel and an actuator, wherein said three omni-directional wheels can be identified as the first omni-directional wheel, the second omni-directional wheel and the third omni-directional wheel respectively, and wherein when the first omni-directional wheel is stopped without rotating while the second omni-directional wheel is rotating clockwisely and the third omni-directional wheel is rotating counterclockwisely, by which the platform is driven to in the direction specified by a first direction, when the first omni-directional wheel is stopped without rotating while the second omni-directional wheel is rotating counterclockwisely and the third omni-directional wheel is rotating clockwisely, the platform is driven to in the direction specified by a second direction that is the opposite direction of the first direction, when the third omni-directional wheel is stopped without rotating while the first omni-directional wheel is rotating clockwisely and the second omni-directional wheel is rotating counterclockwisely, by which the platform is driven to in the direction specified by a third direction, when the third omni-directional wheel is stopped without rotating while the first omni-directional wheel is rotating counterclockwisely and the second omni-directional wheel is rotating clockwisely, the platform is driven to in the direction specified by a forth direction that is the opposite direction of the third direction, and when the second omni-directional wheel is stopped without rotating while the third omni-directional wheel is rotating clockwisely and the first omni-directional wheel is rotating counterclockwisely, by which the platform is driven to in the direction specified by a fifth direction, and when the second omni-directional wheel is stopped without rotating while the first omni-directional wheel is rotating counterclockwisely and the third omni-directional wheel is rotating clockwisely, the platform is driven to in the direction specified by a sixth direction that is the opposite direction of the fifth direction, and when all the three omni-directional wheels are all enabled to rotate counterclockwisely, the platform is driven to rotate clockwisely without moving and when all the three omni-directional wheels are all enabled to rotate clockwisely, the platform is driven to rotate counterclockwisely without moving. 2.
