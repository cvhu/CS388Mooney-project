A separable, general affine transformation according to the invention permits an image to be concurrently rotated, scaled, translated, skewed, sheared, or otherwise transformed via a sequence of one-dimensional transformations. A general affine transformation of an image in two dimensions is achieved by generating an "intermediate" image via affine transformation of the source along a first axis. The intermediate image is then subjected to affine transformation along a second axis, e.g., perpendicular to the first. The resultant image may be used in place of that which would be produced by a single two-dimensional transformation of the source image (e.g., in a single pass).
