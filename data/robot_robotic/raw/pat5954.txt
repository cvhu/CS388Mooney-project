Claims What is claimed is: 1. A composition comprising: (a) a plasmid DNA comprising in 5' to 3' direction, a GAL4 responsive element a promoter, and a polynucleotide encoding a transmembrane region and an apoptosis-inducing domain of a Fas antigen; and (b) a plasmid DNA encoding a fusion protein comprising in a 5' to 3' direction a GAL4 DNA binding region and a nuclear receptor ligand binding region selected from the group consisting of: amino acids 166 to 478 of human PPAR.gamma.1 subtype receptor, amino acids 194 to 506 of human PPAR.gamma.2 subtype receptor, amino acids 164 to 475 of mouse PPAR.gamma.1 subtype receptor, amino acids 194 to 505 of mouse PPAR.gamma.2 subtype receptor, amino acids 157 to 468 of human PPAR.alpha. receptor, amino acids 157 to 468 of rat PPAR.alpha. receptor, amino acids 129 to 441 of human PPAR.delta. receptor, and amino acids 128 to 440 of mouse PPAR.delta. receptor. 2. The composition according to claim 1, wherein said polynucleotide encodes a transmembrane region and an apoptosis-inducing domain of a Fas antigen represented by amino acids 136 to 305 of mouse Fas antigen (SEQ ID NO:23) or amino acids 145 to 319 of human Fas antigen (SEQ ID NO:22). 3. The composition according to claim 1, wherein said polynucleotide further encodes a signal peptide region of a Fas antigen in frame with the transmembrane region and an apoptosis-including domain of Fas antigen, and wherein the transmembrane region and the apoptosis-including domain of a Fas antigen are represented by amino acids 136 to 305 of mouse Fas antigen (SEQ ID NO:23) or amino acids 145 to 319 of human Fas antigen (SEQ ID NO:22). 4. The composition according to claim 3, wherein said polynucleotide encodes a Fas antigen signal peptide region represented by amino acids -21 to 14 of mouse Fas antigen (SEQ ID NO:23) or amino acids -16 to 23 of human Fas antigen (SEQ ID NO:22).
