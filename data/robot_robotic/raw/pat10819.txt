A drive system for a machine such as a robot providing motion in two independent directions under the control of respective motors, comprising a saddle supported for motion in a first said direction, an arm supported by said saddle for motion in the second said direction, a first belt drive arranged to transmit drive from a first of said motors to said saddle and a second belt drive arranged to transmit drive from the second of said motors to said arm, said second belt drive comprising a belt having two portions extending around respective pulleys mounted on the arm and arranged to be driven by the second motor such that one portion is lengthened and the other shortened when the first motor is stopped, so that the arm moves relative to the saddle, but when the first motor is driven and the second motor stopped said two portions remain the same length so that the arm does not move relative to the saddle as the saddle moves.
Claims I claim: 1. A drive system for a machine which provides independent translational motion in at least two different directions comprising: a first carrier supported for motion in a first of said directions; two second carriers supported by said first carrier for motion in the second of said directions; first motor means; first drive means for transmitting power from said first motor means to said first carrier; second motor means; and two second drive means for transmitting power from said second motor means to said second carriers, each of said second drive means comprising a belt having two portions, each of said belt portions extending between points on the first carrier and on a respective second carrier, each said belts being arranged to be driven by said second motor means such that one portion thereof may be lengthened and the other shortened when said first motor means is stopped so that the respective second carrier moves relative to the said first carrier, but when said first motor means is driven and said second motor means is stopped said two belt portions remain the same length so that the respective second carrier does not move relative to said first carrier as said first carrier moves; said second motor means comprising a single second motor and at least a first additional motor, said single second motor driving both said second drive means belts whereby said second carriers move together relative to said first carrier, at least one of said second drive means also being driven by said first additional motor of said second motor means to enable variable drive to be provided to its belt so as to enable relative motion between said second carriers. 2. The drive system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said portions of each said belt extend around respective pulleys mounted on a respective second carrier and also extend around respective pulleys mounted on the first carrier so as to be able to move the pulleys mounted on the second carrier towards and away from the pulleys mounted on the first carrier. 3. A drive system as claimed in claim 1 further comprising: a third carrier supported by said second carriers for motion in a third direction; third motor means; and third drive means for transmitting power from said third motor means to said third carrier, said third drive means comprising first and second belts, each of said belts of said third drive means having first and second portions extending from said third motor means to terminate on said second and third carriers respectively, the second portions of said third drive means first and second belts being lengthened and shortened respectively when the third motor means is driven so that the third carrier moves relative to the second carriers, but when said first or second motor means is driven and said third motor means is stopped the first portions of each belt of said third drive means are equally lengthened and the second portions of each belt of said third drive means are equally shortened so that the third carrier does not move relative to said second carriers as said second carriers move. 4. A drive system for a machine providing independent translational motion in at least two different directions under the control of respective motor means comprising: a first carrier supported for motion in a first of said directions; a second carrier supported by the said first carrier for motion in the second of said directions; first motor means; a first drive arranged to transmit drive power from said first motor means to said first carrier; second motor means; and second drive means arranged to transmit drive power from said second motor means to said second carrier, said second drive means comprising first and second belts, each of said belts having first and second portions extending from said second motor means to terminate respectively on said first and second carriers such that the second portions of said first and second belts are lengthened and shortened respectively when said second motor means is driven so that said second carrier moves relative to said first carrier, but when said first motor means is driven and said second motor means stopped the said first portions of each said belt are equally lengthened and the said second portions of each said belt are equally shortened so that said second carrier does not move relative to said first carrier as said first carrier moves.
