A turret is rotatably secured to a housing adapted to be secured to a robot wrist having a reference orientation and axis. The turret has a plurality of interchangeable lead processing devices which are selectively aligned to the reference orientation and axis. When so aligned a lead processing device is engaged with a selected component and operated to cut and bend the lead of that component. A second component's lead may be processed by the same or a different lead processing device secured to the turret. The latter device is aligned to the reference orientation and axis prior to processing the second component's lead. The robot is programmed to align the reference axis and the corresponding processing device to the selected component whose lead is to be processed.
