Artificial life robotics are utilized in a system for in-space service of spacecraft. An Earth Launch Vehicle (ELV) carries an Exoatmospheric Mothership Vehicle (MSV) into a space trajectory. The MSV, in turn, carries at least one Operational Service Vehicle (OSV). The MSV separates from the ELV and rendezvous within station keeping proximity of the spacecraft. The OSV then separates from the MSV for operative approach to the spacecraft. The OSV includes a propulsion/attitude control system and spacecraft servicing apparatus. The OSV carries an on-board "artificial life" computer which controls the OSV propulsion system and spacecraft servicing apparatus.
Claims Having described my invention in such terms as to enable those skilled in the art to understand and practice it, and having disclosed the presently preferred embodiment thereof, I claim: 1. A system for in-space service of a spacecraft, said system comprising: (A) an earth launch vehicle (ELV); (B) an exoatmospheric mothership vehicle (MSV), adapted to (1) be carried into a first space trajectory by said ELV, (2) separate from said ELV, (3) transit to a second space trajectory higher than low earth orbit (LEO), and (4) station keep with said spacecraft; (C) a plurality of Operational Service Vehicles (OSV), adapted to (1) be carried into said second higher space trajectory by said MSV, (2) separate from said MSV at said station keeping distance and (3) operatively approach said spacecraft, each said OSV including (a) propulsion means, and (b) spacecraft servicing means, and (c) behavior control artificial life computer means for autonomously controlling said propulsion means and said servicing means.
