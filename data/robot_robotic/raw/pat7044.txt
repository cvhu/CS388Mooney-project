Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of SAP-1. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding SAP-1. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of SAP-1 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of SAP-1 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89 or 91 wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with a nucleic acid encoding SAP-1 and inhibits the expression of SAP-1. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of SAP-1 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of SAP-1 is inhibited.
