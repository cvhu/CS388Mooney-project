Improved robotic surgical systems, devices, and methods often include a first assembly with a surgical end effector supported and manipulated relative to a first base by a first robotic linkage, while a second surgical end effector manipulated and supported relative to a second, independent base by a second robotic linkage. One or more of these robotic assemblies may be moved relative to the other. To coordinate the end effector movements with those of input devices being manipulated by a surgeon relative to a display of a surgical worksite, the processor deriving the commands for movement of the robotic linkages may make use of a signal indicating a relative orientation of the bases of the robotic arm assemblies. Surprisingly, the robotic arm assemblies may not transmit signals to the processor indicating a relative translational position of the bases.
