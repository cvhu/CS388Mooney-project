Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of hydrolyzing an oil or fat comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a composition comprising an oil or fat, wherein the oil or fat can be hydrolyzed by a polypeptide having a palmitase activity, wherein the palmitase activity comprises hydrolyzing at least 45% palmitic acid from the oil or fat, said polypeptide being selected from the group consisting of isolated, synthetic and recombinant polypeptides having a palmitase activity and said polypeptide either i. being encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein the nucleic acid encodes at least one polypeptide having a palmitase activity and the polypeptide having at least one base residue change described below in Table A, or ii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and having at least one amino acid residue change described in Table A, TABLE-US-00014 TABLE A Amino Original New Acid Amino Amino Residue Acid Acid 27 G Q 45 G L 54 S H 61 D A E 62 V A G 72 R E K S T 74 F I 83 V M 96 A I 98 G L 116 E A F H L Q Q R, H140R R S S T V 117 L R, I161L 120 K L 133 S A 147 I F 151 I A G H 160 P T 172 R Q 212 S R 213 K T 214 T V N R Y 215 G A H 216 A V C L or iii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2 but also comprising at least one of amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; 1151G; 1151A; V163R; D164R, (b) adding the polypeptide of step (a) to the composition comprising said oil or fat in an amount sufficient and under conditions sufficient to cause hydrolysis of the oil or fat, thereby hydrolyzing the oil or fat. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said hydrolyzed oil or fat has a lower saturated fat content than said oil or fat prior to hydrolysis. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said oil or fat comprises an algal oil, an animal oil, a vegetable oil, an oil having an altered fatty acid composition, a low saturated oil, fish oil or a combination thereof. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein said oil comprises Neochloris oleoabundans oil, Scenedesmus dimorphus oil, Euglena gracilis oil, Phaeodactylum tricornutum oil, Pleurochrysis carterae oil, Prymnesium parvum oil, Tetraselmis chui oil, Tetraselmis suecica oil, Isochrysis galbana oil, Nannochloropsis salina oil, Botryococcus braunii oil, Dunaliella tertiolecta oil, Nannochloris species oil, Spirulina species oil, Chlorophycease oil, Bacilliarophy oil, canola oil, castor oil, coconut oil, coriander oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, hazelnut oil, other nut oils, hempseed oil, linseed oil, meadowfoam oil, olive oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, sasanqua oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower seed oil, tall oil, tsubaki oil, tallow, lard, butter fat, chicken fat, or a blend of any of said fats or oils. 5. The method of claim 3, wherein the altered fatty acid comprises high oleic oil, low linolenic oil or a combination thereof. 6. The method of claim 3, wherein the low saturated oil comprises high oleic canola oil, low linolenic soybean oil, high stearic sunflower oil or a combination thereof. 7. The method of claim 3, wherein the fish oil comprises candlefish oil, cod-liver oil, orange roughy oil, sardine oil, herring oil, menhaden oil or a combination thereof. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein said fats or oils comprise molecules having a triacylglyceride backbone and wherein during said hydrolysis palmitic acid is removed from at least some of the triacylglyceride backbones. 9. The method of claim 8, wherein said palmitic acid is selectively removed from an Sn1 or Sn3 position on the triacylglyceride backbone. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein said oil or fat is present in a feed or a food and said hydrolysis is accomplished prior to the consumption of said feed or food by an animal or an individual. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein said oil or fat comprises one or more of a triacylglycerol, a diacylglycerol, or a monoacylglycerol, and wherein said polypeptide of step (a) is contacted with said oil or fat under conditions wherein said polypeptide hydrolyzes one or more of said triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol or monoacylglycerol. 12. The method of claim 11 wherein said hydrolysis causes the amount of triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol or monoacylglycerol in the composition to decrease. 13. The method of claim 1, wherein the oil or fat comprises a glycerol ester of a polyunsaturated fatty acid. 14. The method of claim 1, wherein said hydrolyzed oil or fat comprises any one or more of a low-saturate oil or fat, a no-trans oil or fat, a lipid containing essential fatty acids, a lipid containing monounsaturated fatty acids, a lipid containing phospho-choline, a lipid containing phospho-serine, a lipid containing a phytosterol, a 1,3-diacylglyceride, a 2-monoacylglyceride, and a triacylglyceride. 15. The method of claim 1, wherein said composition comprises a milk or vegetable-based dietary composition, wherein the polypeptide can hydrolyze the oil or fat in the composition, thereby reducing its fat content. 16. The method of claim 1, wherein polypeptide comprises at least one of amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; 1151G; 1151A; V163R; D164R.
