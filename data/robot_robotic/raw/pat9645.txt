An improved gripping and pinching device particularly useful with laboratory glassware and adaptable for use with a robot or automated system, is disclosed. The device uses flexible tubing as a gripper, eyedropper pincher and as a pinch valve which biases and releases test tubes, vials or the like upon removal and application of a vacuum or pressurizing means.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A tool for gripping and releasing test tubes, vials and the like which comprises: a) a housing element containing a plurality of chambers for holding said tubes, vials and the like; b) a loop of flexible tubing mounted within the housing element such that it is in position to contact the tubes, vials and the like when expanded; c) biasing means to effectuate the expanding and contracting of the flexible tubing in order to grip and release the test tubes, vials and the like. 2. The tool as claimed in claim 1 wherein said biasing means comprises hydraulic means, pneumatic means or a vacuum. 3. The tool as claimed in claim 2 wherein said hydraulic means comprises a water line in order to control the temperature of the material within the tube, vial and the like being contacted. 4. The tool as claimed in claim 1 which can optionally be adapted to a laboratory robot or other automated system.
