Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for identifying a compound which binds to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: a) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4; and b) a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5; the method comprising the steps of: i) combining a cell expressing the polypeptide with a test compound; and ii) determining whether the polypeptide binds to the test compound. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the binding of the test compound to the polypeptide is detected by a method selected from the group consisting of: a) detection of binding by direct detecting of test compound/polypeptide binding; b) detection of binding using a competition binding assay. 3. The method claim 1, wherein the compound identified is an agent that inhibits the activity of the polypeptide. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5.
