A molding apparatus is configured with article molding regions that receive a direct flow of a molding material feed such that external flow channels are not needed. The article molding regions are formed into front sides of opposed "A" and "B" surface mold tools that, when moved into a mating relationship with one another, form closed molding cavities within which molded articles are generated from molding material feed. The article molding regions each generally have a body bounded by a perimeter that establishes an outer edge for an article molded in the one of the closed molding cavities. With at least the "A" surface mold tool, a port is coupled with the body of each article molding region to establish a direct pathway is through which the molding material feed flows to enter the article molding regions, and thus the closed molding cavity, without having to flow along the tool front sides outside of the article molding regions. A distribution channel extends to each port to deliver the molding material feed and a moveable blocking pin is provided for each port to alternately prevent the molding material feed from flowing through the respective port to reach the closed molding cavity and allow the molding material to flow through the respective port to reach the closed molding cavity.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for molding an article, comprising: providing opposed first and second surface mold tools each including a front side and a back portion, the front side having an article molding region characterized by a body bounded by a perimeter that defines a complete outer edge for a molded article, the article molding regions of first and second surface mold tools being mateable with one another to form a closed molding cavity within which the molded article is formed; providing a thermally conductive longitudinally extending port coupled to the body of the article molding region of the first surface molding tool, the port comprising a substantially hollow member having an inner surface and an outer surface, the inner surface defining a shaped passageway wherein abrasive molding material flows through the shaped passageway into the article molding region, and a distribution channel extending to the port through the back portion of the first surface mold tool; providing a blocking pin moveable within the shaped passageway to control molding material flow through the port, wherein the blocking pin includes a retracted position external to the port, the shaped passageway and the distribution channel; moving at least one of the first and second surface mold tools to bring the front sides of the first and second surface mold tools together to form the closed molding cavity; supplying abrasive molding material, which is used to make composite roofing shingles, under pressure to the distribution channel so that the abrasive molding material flows through the distribution channel and the shaped passageway, and into the closed molding cavity, the shaped passageway of the port enabling the abrasive molding material to flow from the back portion of the first surface mold tool directly into the closed molding cavity; moving the blocking pin from the retracted position to a blocking position within the shaped passageway to shut off the flow of the abrasive molding material through the shaped passageway and into the closed molding cavity, the blocking pin being in thermal communication with the inner surface of the port when the pin is in the blocking position; providing a heat sink comprising a hollow chamber partially defined by the outer surface of the port, the hollow chamber defining a fluid space for holding a cooling fluid; moving the cooling fluid through the chamber of the heat sink, wherein the cooling fluid directly contacts and circumscribes the outer surface of the port, to remove heat energy from the port and the blocking pin; and maintaining the front sides of the first and second surface mold tools together for a period of time to form the molded article from the molding material. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: moving at least one of the first and second surface mold tools to separate the front sides of the first and second surface mold tools and reveal the molded article; removing the molded article under a vacuum draw; and transporting the molded article to a location for packaging with other molded articles. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the perimeter of the article molding region of each of the first and second surface mold tools defines an outer edge for the molded article, the article molding regions of the first and second surface mold tools being configured to provide a molded article free of gating along an outer edge thereof. 4. A method for molding an article, comprising: providing opposed first and second surface mold tools each including a front side and a back portion, the front side having an article molding region characterized by a body bounded by a perimeter that defines a complete outer edge for a molded article, the article molding regions of first and second surface mold tools being mateable with one another to form a closed molding cavity within which the molded article is formed; providing a thermally conductive longitudinally extending port coupled to the body of the article molding region of the first surface molding tool, the port comprising a substantially hollow member having an inner surface and an outer surface, the inner surface defining a shaped passageway wherein abrasive molding material flows through the shaped passageway into the article molding region, and a distribution channel extending to the port through the back portion of the first surface mold tool; providing a blocking pin moveable within the shaped passageway to control molding material flow through the port, wherein the blocking pin includes a retracted position external to the port, the shaped passageway and the distribution channel; moving at least one of the first and second surface mold tools to bring the front sides of the first and second surface mold tools together to form the closed molding cavity; supplying abrasive molding material, which is used to make composite roofing shingles, under pressure to the distribution channel so that the abrasive molding material flows through the distribution channel and the shaped passageway, and into the closed molding cavity, the shaped passageway providing a direct pathway enabling the abrasive molding material to flow from the back portion of the first surface mold tool directly into the closed molding cavity; moving the blocking pin from the retracted position to a blocking position within the shaped passageway to shut off the flow of the abrasive molding material through the shaped passageway and into the closed molding cavity, the blocking pin being in thermal communication with the inner surface of the port when the pin is in the blocking position; distributing a cooling fluid through a supply line to a heat sink, the heat sink comprising a hollow chamber partially defined by the outer surface of the port, the hollow chamber defining a fluid space for holding the cooling fluid, wherein the cooling fluid directly contacts and circumscribes the outer surface of the port, thereby absorbing the frictional heat from the port and the blocking pin; and maintaining the front sides of the first and second surface mold tools together for a period of time to form the molded article from the molding material.
