An end effector or centering chuck is disclosed having centering fingers which employ a linear sliding motion. A stepper motor is mounted on the centering chuck and controls the opening and closing of the centering fingers. The stepper motor is controlled such that the centering fingers decelerate as they approach the work to be centered. The X-axis fingers, for example, are moved into engagement with the work to be centered with the Y-axis fingers disengaged. After alignment in the X direction is achieved, the work is centered in the Y-axis direction with the Y fingers while the X fingers are disengaged.
