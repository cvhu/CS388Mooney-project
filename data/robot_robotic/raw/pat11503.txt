A method is disclosed of using a robot with a single fixture to install a headliner in a vehicle body on an assembly line wherein both the configuration of the vehicle body and the material and/or color as well as the configuration of the headliner vary and are combined at an assembly station.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as possible: 1. A method of using a robot to install a headliner in a vehicle body on an assembly line wherein both the configuration of the vehicle body and the material and/or color as well as the configuration of the headliner vary and are combined at an assembly station comprising the steps of: forming all the various vehicle bodies and headliners with common sunshade accommodating holes, providing an arm of the robot with a fixture having locators corresponding to the sunshade accommodating holes in the vehicle bodies and headliners, sequentially conveying the vehicle bodies relative to the robot, coordinating and sequentially conveying the headliners relative to the robot so as to correspond in a prescribed matchup with the vehicles bodies approaching the robot, having the robot arm pick up, support and hold a preselected headliner by the fixture locators engaging in the sunshade accommodating holes in the headliner, having the robot arm with the headliner supported thereon enter a preselected headlinerless vehicle body through its windshield opening and extend beneath its ceiling, having the robot arm with the headliner supported thereon locate and also engage the fixture locators in the sunshade accommodating holes in the vehicle body, and having the robot arm move the supported and located headliner thereon into position against the vehicle body ceiling for affixing thereto. 2. A method of using a robot to install a headliner in a vehicle body on an assembly line wherein both the configuration of the vehicle body and the material and/or color as well as the configuration of the headliner vary and are selectively combined at an assembly station comprising the steps of: forming all the various vehicle bodies and headliners with a pair of common sunshade accommodating holes, providing an arm of the robot with a fixture having a pair of locators corresponding to the sunshade accommodating holes in the vehicle bodies and headliners, sequentially conveying the vehicle bodies to and from the robot, coordinating and sequentially conveying the headliners to the robot so as to correspond in a prescribed matchup with the vehicles bodies approaching the robot, having the robot arm pick up, support and hold the leading headliner by the fixture locators engaging in the sunshade accommodating holes in the headliner, having the robot arm with the headliner supported thereon enter the leading headlinerless vehicle body through its windshield opening and extend beneath its ceiling, having the robot arm with the headliner supported thereon locate and also engage the fixture locators in the sunshade accommodating holes in the vehicle body, and having the robot arm move the supported and located headliner thereon into position against the vehicle body ceiling and effect pressurized affixing thereto.
