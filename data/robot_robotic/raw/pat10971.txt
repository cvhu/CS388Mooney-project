A work piece positioning device which has a table upon which the work piece is supported is disclosed. The table is rotatably mounted on a sub-assembly which is tiltably mounted on a frame such that the work piece can be positioned in any desired predetermined attitude. Two worm gear systems are utilized for positioning the table, one for the rotating action and one for the tilting action. Each worm gear system has a worm gear, a tiltable worm and a locking mechanism. Once the table and work piece are in the desired predetermined attitude, the locking mechanisms are actuated, locking each worm to its respective worm gear.
Claims What is claimed as new is: 1. A lockable worm and gear drive comprising: a worm gear having a plurality of gear teeth; a rotatability mounted worm which forceably and drivingly engages the gear teeth of said worm gear; means for increasing the force between said worm and said worm gear teeth to provide rigid locking of said worm and worm gear to prevent relative rotation therebetween, and wherein said worm is rotatably mounted in a housing, said housing being tiltably support adjacent one end and having means for tilting said housing to increase the force between said worm and said worm gear teeth; reciprocable means operatively connected with the end of said worm opposite said tilting means for applying a force to said housing to tilt said housing; and wherein said reciprocable means comprises a spring-biased pin reciprocably mounted for continuous engagement with one side of said worm housing and a solenoid-actuated cylinder and plunger mounted for engaging the opposite side of said worm housing with sufficient force to cause retraction of spring-biased pin. 2. The worm and gear drive called for in claim 1 wherein said tilting means comprises a ball-shaped section mounted on said housing and socket means for receiving said ball-shaped section.
