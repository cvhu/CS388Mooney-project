This invention relates to an automated device for loading a centrifuge where tubes are presented to the centrifuge via an automated routing system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A process for automating processing of samples through a fault-tolerant centrifuge using a device which has a processing station interposed between a tube collection or transport device and the fault-tolerant centrifuge, the station comprising: a) a staging area for tube adaptors which facilitates the loading and unloading of the centrifuge; b) a dual function tool having i) a tube gripper which recognizes and adapts to tubes of different height and diameter on the tube collection or transport device and which routes tubes between the tube collection or transport device and the centrifuge adaptors; and ii) an adaptor gripper capable of transporting adaptors to and from the centrifuge, the process comprising: a) picking tubes of different height and diameter from the tube collection or transport device under direction of a system's control mechanism, b) placing them in adaptors on the staging area in a sequence which provides paired adaptors of essentially balanced weight such that when a centrifuge cycles, a weight distribution between paired adaptors is within a fault tolerance limit of the centrifuge, c) placing the paired adaptors into the centrifuge opposite each other, d) removing adaptors from the centrifuge to the staging area after a spin cycle; and e) picking cycled tubes from the adaptors and placing them on the tube collection or transport system. 2. A robotic device for automating processing of samples through a fault-tolerant centrifuge, the device comprising: a processing station which is interposed between a tube collection or transport device and a fault-tolerant centrifuge, the station having a) a staging area for tube adaptors which facilitates the loading and unloading of the centrifuge; and b) a dual function tool having i) a tube gripper which recognizes and adapts to tubes of different height and diameter on the tube collection or transport device and which routes tubes between the tube collection or transport device and the centrifuge adaptors; and ii) an adaptor gripper capable of transporting adaptors to and from the centrifuge; an electronic control means for controlling an action of the dual function tool in sequence with the following: 1) operation of the tube collection or transport device, and 2) placement of tubes in adaptors in a balanced fashion, and 3) transport of adaptors to and from the centrifuge in sequence with cycling of the centrifuge, and 4) unloading of processed tubes from adaptors. 3. A process for automating processing of samples through at least one fault-tolerant centrifuge using a device which has a processing station interposed between a tube collection or transport device and a fault-tolerant centrifuge, the station comprising: a) a staging area for tube adaptors which facilitates the loading and unloading of the centrifuge; b) a dual function tool having: i) a tube gripper which recognizes and adapts to tubes of different heights and diameters on the tube collection or transport device and which routes tubes between the tube collection or transport device and the centrifuge adaptors on the staging area; and ii) an adaptor gripper capable of transporting adaptors to and from said centrifuge, the process comprising: a) under automated control: (1) identifying the height and diameter of a tube on the tube collection or transport device; (2) selecting a tube which have a pre-set height and diameter; (3) gripping and removing the selected tube from the collection or transport device; (4) placing the tube in an adaptor on the staging area in a sequence which provides paired adaptors of essentially balanced weight such that when the centrifuge cycles, the weight distribution between the paired adaptors is within the fault tolerance limit of the centrifuge; (5) placing the filled or partially filled, balanced, paired adaptors into the centrifuge opposite each other; (6) removing adaptors from the centrifuge to the staging area after the spin cycle; and (7) picking cycled tubes from the adaptors and placing them on the tube collection or transport device. 4. A robotic device for automating processing of samples through a fault-tolerant centrifuge, the device comprising: a) a tube collection or transport device interfaced with, b) a processing station interposed between the tube collection or transport device and at least one fault-tolerant centrifuge and interfaced with c) a fault-tolerant centrifuge, the station having i) a staging area for tube adaptors which facilitates the loading and unloading of the centrifuge; and ii) a dual function tool having a) a tube gripper which (1) recognizes and adapts to tubes of different height and diameter on the tube collection or transport device; (2) selects tube of only a pre-set height and diameter; (3) places tubes in paired adaptors in a balanced fashion; (4) routes tubes between the tube collection or transport device and the centrifuge adaptors on the staging area, and vice versa; and b) an adaptor gripper capable of transporting adaptors to and from the centrifuge; c) an electronic control means for controlling the action of the tool in sequence with the operation of the tube collection or transport device, the placement of tubes in adaptors in a balanced fashion, the transport of adaptors to and from the centrifuge in sequence with the cycling of the centrifuge, and the unloading of processed tubes from adaptors.
