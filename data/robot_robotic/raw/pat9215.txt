An interpolation operation is performed between a pair of stereo images to produce plural intermediate images. The interpiolation operation involves estimating the velocity vector field of the intermediate images. The estimation for a particular intermediate image includes constraining the search for the correspondences between the two images in the horizontal direction allowing the system to arrive at a more optimal solution. Excessive gap filling by smoothing is not necessary. At the same time the process vertically aligns the entirety of the images.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method, comprising the steps of: (a) capturing a pair of stereo images of a scene separated in a horizontal direction; (b) creating, using a computer, an in-between image intermediate between the pair by estimating velocity vector fields providing a correspondence between the images using a global search constrained in a horizontal direction and interpolating the in-between image; and (c) producing a depth image from the pair of stereo images and the in-between image. 2. A method as recited in claim 1, wherein step (b) creates plural in-between images. 3. A method as recited in claim 1, wherein step (b) includes aligning an entirety of the pair of stereo and the in-between image in a vertical direction simultaneously. 4. A method as recited in claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises the steps of: (i) determining a scene correspondence between the pair of stereo images by constraining correspondence searching in the horizontal direction; and (ii) interpolating between the pair of stereo images using the scene correspondence.
