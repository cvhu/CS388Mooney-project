A robotic arm has a base with a top surface and an aperture therein. A shaft extends up through the aperture, and there is a gap between the shaft and an inner edge of the aperture. A splash guard may extend over said gap, and an indentation in said top surface may at least partially surround the gap. A seal, including a bearing and a barrier, is located in the gap. The bearing allows the inner and outer surfaces to rotate relative to each other. The barrier includes a plurality of annular outward-pointing flanges attached to an inner surface interleaved with a plurality of annular inward-pointing flanges attached to an outer surface. The flanges may be angled and have an upturned lip located at an inner edge of each flange. The seal may include a magnet attached to a flange.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic arm, comprising: a first housing which provides a base of the robotic arm, the housing having a generally horizontal and integral top surface with an aperture therein; a drive shaft extending up through said aperture and connected to a second housing which provides a generally horizontal link of the robotic arm, there being a gap between said shaft and an inner edge of said aperture; an indentation in said top surface spaced apart from and at least partially surrounding said gap; and a splash guard connected to said shaft, said splash guard extending over said gap. 2. The robotic arm of claim 1 wherein said splash guard extends at least partially over said indentation in said top surface. 3. The robotic arm of claim 2 wherein said splash guard has a downturned edge positioned to direct liquid into said indentation.
