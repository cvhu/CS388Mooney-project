An industrial robotic system related to the present invention provides a workpiece handling robot manipulating a workpiece and a tool handling robot manipulating a tool processing the workpiece. A teaching control device for manual operation of the robotic system controls not only the execution of a conventional sole-acting manual mode of operation, but also the execution of a co-acting manual mode of operation. According to a co-acting manual mode of operation, "a relative position and a relative attitude of a tool against a workpiece" are maintained substantially constant. When the manipulation of the workpiece is executed in order to get a new setting state by means of a co-acting manual mode of operation from an initial setting state, the tip point of the tool is remained at an aimed point on the workpiece and an attitude of the tool against the workpiece is maintained without interference between the tool and the workpiece. The new setting state for teaching a new teaching point is established by means of sole-acting manipulating the tool from the aimed point manipulated by the workpiece handling robot to a new aimed on the workpiece.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A teaching control device for manual operations of an industrial robotic system, the robotic system including a workpiece handling robot for manipulating a position and an attitude of a workpiece and a tool handling robot for manipulating a position and an attitude of a tool processing said workpiece, said teaching control device comprising: (a) selecting means of sole-action/co-action for supplying a mode signal for selecting (i) a sole-acting manual mode of operation of said robotic system wherein manipulation of the position and the attitude of the workpiece by said workpiece handling robot are performed independently of the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the tool by said tool handling robot, and (ii) a co-acting manual mode of operation wherein the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the tool by said tool handling robot are coordinated with and interdependent on the manipulation of the position and the attitude of the workpiece by said workpiece handling robot so that a relative position and a relative attitude of the tool against the workpiece are maintained substantially constant; (b) selecting means of a handling robot for supplying a robot signal to select one of the workpiece handling robot and the tool handling robot; (c) teaching key means for supplying actuating signals for changing the position and the attitude of said workpiece or said tool; (d) control means for co-acting teaching operations and controlling said robotic system in response to said actuating signals, said robot signal selecting said workpiece handling robot and said mode signal, said control means comprising a computer for performing the following steps; (i) receiving said actuating signals, computing a previous position and a previous attitude of the workpiece in a preset coordinate system before receiving said actuating signals in response to previous joint variables of said workpiece handling robot and computing a previous relative position and a previous relative attitude of the tool against the workpiece before receiving said actuating signals in response to previous joint variables of said workpiece handling robot and previous joint variables of said tool handling robot; (ii) controlling an execution of a calculating step in response to said actuating signals maintained for a preset time interval, controlling a repetition of said computing step in response to detecting a change in said actuating signals in the middle of said preset time interval or controlling a termination of said co-acting manual mode of operation in response to an absence of said actuating signals in the middle of said preset time interval; (iii) calculating the position and the attitude of said workpiece after a preset time interval in response to said actuating signals and said previous position and said previous attitude of the workpiece in the preset coordinate system before receiving said actuating signals calculated by said computing step and calculating the position and the attitude of the tool after a preset time interval in response to said previous relative position and said previous relative attitude of the tool against the workpiece before receiving the actuating signals calculated by said computing step and said position and said attitude of the workpiece after a preset time interval; (iv) calculating joint variables of the workpiece handling robot after a preset time interval in response to the position and the attitude of the workpiece after a preset time interval calculated by said calculating step and calculating joint variables of the tool handling robot after a preset time interval in response to a position and an attitude of the tool after a preset time interval calculated by said calculating step; and (v) calculating actuating values for the actuators of the workpiece handling robot in response to said joint variables of the workpiece handling robot after a preset time interval and calculating the actuating values for the actuators of the tool handling robot in response to said joint variables of the tool handling robot after a preset time interval, and in response, simultaneously supplying control signals of the actuating values to the actuators of the workpiece handling robot and control signals of the actuating values to actuators of the tool handling robot, and further commanding a repetition of said controlling step. 2.
