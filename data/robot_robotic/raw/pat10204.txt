A robot hand is implemented by a wrist mechanism coupled with a retaining member for allowing a work to rotate around a first axis, and the wrist mechanism comprises a first bracket member rotational around a second axis and a second bracket member holding the retaining member and rotational with respect to the first bracket member around a third axis, wherein the first to third axes cross at a virtual point within a virtual space occupied by the work so that a distance between the virtual point and a center of the work is decreased, thereby delicately controlling the attitude of the work.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot hand comprising: a) a wrist mechanism, and b) a retaining member supported by said wrist mechanism and holding a work, said wrist mechanism further including; a-1) a first bracket member having a first axis, a first reduction gear unit coupled with a first electric motor unit for rotatably driving said first bracket member around said first axis, a-2) a second bracket member supported by said first bracket member, a second reduction gear unit coupled with a second electric motor unit for rotatably driving said second bracket member with respect to said first bracket member around a second axis, said second reduction unit and said second electric motor unit being supported by said first bracket member, said first and second axes crossing at a substantially right angle, said retaining member allowing said work to rotate around a third axis crossing said second axis at a substantially right angle, said first to third axes crossing at a virtual point located within a virtual space occupied by said work, said work having a center of gravity substantially matched with said virtual point, and a-3) a third reduction gear unit coupled with a third electric motor unit for rotatably driving said retaining member, said third reduction gear unit and said third electric motor unit being supported by said second bracket member, said first bracket member being formed by first and second straight members connected at a right angle shaped into a generally L configuration, said second reduction gear unit and said second electric motor unit being supported by an end portion of said first straight member the opposite end of which is connected to said second straight member, said second bracket being formed by a third straight member and by fourth and fifth straight members, respectively projecting from both end portions of said third straight member at a right angle, said second axis crossing said third straight member at a center portion thereof, said third axis passing through leading end portions of said fourth and fifth straight members.
