Apparatus for molding and filling a device having a body defining an opening in communication with an interior chamber for receiving a substance therein, and a closure including a penetrable and resealable portion for sealing the opening and substance received in the device. A mold includes within the aseptic chamber plural mold cavities shaped to form the closure and body, and substantially sterile surfaces extending about and contiguous to the peripheries of the mold cavities. An assembly device including end-of-arm tooling having an engaging portion engageable with each of the body and closure is movable relative to the mold to engage and de-mold the substantially sterile closures and bodies from the mold cavities. Flexible barriers are coupled to the mold and the tool to substantially prevent the passage of contaminants from the molding machine and tool therethrough.
