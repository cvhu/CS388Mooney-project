An arrangement in robot-controlled systems using vision devices for sensing visual or optical characteristics of predetermined parameters associated with the robot-controlled system or the process carried out by the system. A flexible barrier is placed between the vision device and visually interfering effects resulting from the robot-controlled process, such as bright light of a welding arc, or particles such as smoke or machining chips. The flexible barrier provides an economical solution for accommodating complex shapes and imprecise positioning.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An arrangement for reducing light, particle and moving material interference with vision systems used in automated material processing where said interference is generated by said material processing, comprising: material processing means producing light and moving materials within an environment contaminated by said moving materials; vision means for sensing predetermined visual characteristics of the material processing, sectioned flexible barriers arranged in at least two rows; openings between said sections for improved air flow; said openings being staggered to block linear light paths between the material processing means and the vision means. 2. An arrangement as defined in claim 1, wherein at least a part of said flexible barriers comprises hairlike material. 3. An arrangement for reducing light, particle and moving material interference with vision systems used in automated material processing where said interference is generated by said material processing, comprising: a weld head wth a weld tip; molten metal being transferred from said weld tip to a workpiece surface during a welding operation resulting in a substantially bright arc in vicinity of a weld; flexible barrier means located between a vision center and a weld point, said barrier means having a lower portion comprised of substantially flexible hairlike material which can change shape to all voids in the workpiece, said hairlike material of said barrier means filling the weld seam as well as following contours of the workpiece surface for blocking direct and indirect arc glare, weld spatter, and smoke from reaching the vision system; said hairlike material at the bottom of said barrier means comprised of replaceable sections; said hairlike sections comprising a first row of sections having spaces between adjacent sections; and at least a second row of hairlike sections with spaces between adjacent sections, said sections of said second row being superposed on spaces of said first row and spaces of said second row being superposed on hairlike sections of said first row, said second row being spaced from said first row for allowing air flow between said spaces and said rows.
