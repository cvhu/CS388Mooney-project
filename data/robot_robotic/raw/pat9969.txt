Systems and methods allow for the accurate determination of the terrestrial position of an autonomous vehicle in real time. A first position estimate of the vehicle 102 is derived from satellites of a global positioning system and/or a pseudolite(s). The pseudolite(s) may be used exclusively when the satellites are not in the view of the vehicle. A second position estimate is derived from an inertial reference unit and/or a vehicle odometer. The first and second position estimates are combined and filtered using novel techniques to derive a more accurate third position estimate of the vehicle's position. Accordingly, accurate autonomous navigation of the vehicle can be effectuated using the third position estimate.
Claims The following is claimed: 1. A system for determining the position of a user using orbiting satellites of a global positioning system and a reference station, the system comprising: (a) first means for computing respective first positions of the satellites in view of a reference antenna at the reference station using previous ephemeris data and responsively determining respective predicted estimated pseudoranges (O.sub.ij); (b) second means for computing respective second positions of the satellites in view of said reference antenna at the reference station using current ephemeris data and responsively determining respective current estimated pseudoranges (N.sub.ij); (c) third means responsive to said first and second means, said third means for receiving said respective predicted estimated pseudoranges (O.sub.ij) and said respective current estimated pseudoranges (N.sub.ij), comparing said predicted estimated pseudoranges (O.sub.ij) and said respective current estimated pseudoranges (N.sub.ij), and responsively determining if said current ephemeris data is corrupt; (d) fourth means responsive to said third means, said fourth means for computing a spatial bias using said current ephemeris data if said current ephemeris data is not corrupt and computing a spatial bias using said previous ephemeris data if said current ephemeris data is corrupt; (e) fifth means located at the user, for receiving signals from said satellites and said spatial bias and responsively determining an estimate of the position of the user. 2. A method for determining the position of a user using orbiting satellites of a global positioning system and a reference station, the method comprising the steps of: (1) computing respective predicted estimated pseudoranges (O.sub.ij) of the satellites in view of a reference antenna at the reference station using previous ephemeris data; (2) computing current estimated pseudoranges (N.sub.ij) of the satellites using current ephemeris data; (3) comparing said predicted estimated pseudoranges and said current estimated pseudoranges and responsively determining if said ephemeris data is corrupt; (4) computing a spatial bias using said current ephemeris data if said current ephemeris data is not corrupt and computing a spatial bias using said previous ephemeris data if said current ephemeris data is corrupt; and (5) receiving, at the user, signals from the satellites and said spatial bias and responsively determining an estimate of the position of the user.
