In a single-row and expandable into a multi-row stretch blow molding method and apparatus, a robot having a universal gripper assembly is used to pick up molded preforms during the clamp opening stroke of a preform-molding unit and then transfer the preforms at variable time intervals to a conditioning, stretch blow molding and discharge unit, releases finished hollow articles and returns to a waiting position at the preform-molding unit independent of the preform-molding cycle. Simultaneously, component transfer devices pick up external components, i.e. labels, valves or handles during the stretch blow molding phase and release the components into the blow-mold cavities while the universal gripper assembly is in the waiting position. The universal gripper assembly can alternatively also be pivoted to pick up preforms from a lateral reheat unit to supplement the molded preform supply. A modular stack-blow-mold clamp assembly is equipped with a plurality of pivoting spacing means which open and close the blow-mold halves and align their respective parting lines to correspond with the center-row distances of the preform molds, conditioning and stretch blow means. Prior to the transfer of the molded preforms to a conditioning station, internal components, i.e. sleeves or liners can be inserted into the neck and body portion of the preforms. Further, a secondary robot with a gripper assembly can pick up pretreated preforms from the first set of blow molds and transfer them into one or several consecutive blow mold assemblies.
