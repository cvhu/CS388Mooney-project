An industrial robot is disclosed having a base which is secured to a ground support surface. A robotic manipulator is pivotally mounted to the base about a predetermined axis. The base and robotic manipulator, furthermore, form a channel therebetween around at least a portion of an outer periphery of the base and the robotic manipulator. An elongated flexible tube is positioned in the channel and one end of the tube is secured to the base while the other end is secured to the robotic manipulator. The tube forms a guide for wires and/or conduits extending between the base and the robotic manipulator.
Claims I claim: 1. A robot comprising: a base, said base secured to a ground support surface, a robotic manipulator, means for pivotally securing said robotic manipulator to said base about a predetermined axis, said base and said robotic manipulator forming a channel therebetween around at least a portion of an outer periphery of said base and said robotic manipulator, an elongated flexible tube positioned in said channel, said tube having one end secured to said base and a second end secured to said robotic manipulator, wherein said tube forms a guide for wires/conduits extending between said base and said robotic manipulator wherein said tube comprises an elongated helical spring whereby resiliency of said helical spring maintains said helical spring in an extended condition such that an upper portion of said helical spring overlies a lower portion of said helical spring during rotation of said robotic manipulation about said predetermined axis relative to said base. 2. The invention as defined in claim 1 and comprising a second flexible tube positioned in said channel, said second flexible tube having one end secured to said base and a second end secured to said robotic manipulator, said second flexible tube being circumferentially spaced from said first mentioned tube, wherein said tube forms a guide for wires/conduits extending between said base and said robotic manipulator wherein said second flexible tube comprises a helical spring.
