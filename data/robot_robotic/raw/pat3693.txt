The present invention comprises a removable capillary tip insert which provides for replacement of an individual capillary in the dispensing head of an automated liquid handling apparatus. In some embodiments, the insert has been designed to accept variable capillary lengths while maintaining a constant length protruding from the insert. In a preferred embodiment, the removable capillary insert of the invention comprises a head adapted to accept an insertion tool and tapered to seat in the dispense head; a shaft with external threads which form a threaded collar that permits the insert to be screwed into the dispense head; a lumen running internally from the proximal to the distal ends of the head and shaft which forms a hollow interior in the insert in which a capillary resides; and a capillary tube of user-selected liquid capacity. One embodiment, without limitation, comprises a molded plastic part with an integral capillary tube. Other embodiments comprise dispensing heads with various configurations of capillary inserts and methods for automated liquid dispensing using the same.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for automated dispensing of liquid samples, comprising the steps of: providing a mounting block for an automated liquid dispensing apparatus comprising: one or more removable capillary tip inserts comprising a head, a shaft with external threads, an internal lumen extending the lengths of the head and the shaft, and a capillary tube having a distal end, the capillary tube joined to a distal end of the shaft opposite said head, the distal end of the capillary protruding from the distal end of the shaft, the capillary tube being configured to draw a liquid therein through its distal end by capillary action; a surface comprising a plurality of holes configured to accept the external threads and shapes of the inserts; and one or more orifices for the application of air pressure to one or more of the inserts; providing a source substrate containing one or more liquid samples; providing a destination substrate for one or more liquid samples; providing an automated liquid dispensing apparatus comprising: a dispensing head; means to cycle the dispensing head between source and destination substrates; and means to selectively apply air pressure to one or more of the removable capillary tip inserts; configuring the mounting block to fasten to the dispensing head; and cycling the mounting block between the source substrate and the destination substrate, such that a portion of one or more samples from the source substrate is taken up by one or more inserts on the mounting plate by capillary action and dispensed onto the destination substrate by selective application of air pressure to the insert.
