A method includes installing a device under test (DUT) into each of a plurality of burn-in boards. The method further includes docking each of the burn-in boards to a respective docking location, each of the burn-in boards with a single respective DUT installed therein. The method further includes subjecting the DUTs to a self-heating burn-in procedure while the burn-in boards are docked to the docking locations. Other embodiments are described and claimed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method comprising: applying a burn-in procedure to a device under test (DUT) at a burn-in station; receiving a first signal from the DUT, said first signal indicating that an internal temperature of the DUT exceeds a first threshold temperature; receiving a second signal from the DUT, said second signal indicating that the internal temperature of the DUT exceeds a second threshold temperature that is higher than the first threshold temperature; during the burn-in procedure, controlling a fan at the burn-in station in response to said first signal; and during the burn-in procedure, controlling a source of power for the DUT in response to said second signal. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: transmitting the second signal from the DUT to a driver circuit; and transmitting a control signal from the driver circuit to the source of power. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the burn-in procedure is a self-heating burn-in procedure. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the burn-in station is a docking location that includes a connector adapted to be coupled to an edge connector of a burn-in board in which the DUT is installed.
