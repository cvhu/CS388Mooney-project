Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to the 3'-untranslated region (residues 526-3805 of SEO ID NO: 10) of a nucleic acid molecule encoding E2F transcription factor 3, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with said 3'-untranslated region and inhibits the expression of E2F trancription factor 3. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of E2F transcription factor 3 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of E2F transcription factor 3 is inhibited. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding E2F transcription factor 3, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid molecule and inhibits the expression of E2F transcription factor 3 and wherein said antisense compound has a sequence comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 50, 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 66, 70, 72, 74, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, or 88. 15. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 14 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 16. The composition of claim 15 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 17. The composition of claim 16 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 18. A method of inhibiting the expression of E2P transcription factor 3 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 14 so that the expression of E2F transcription factor 3 is inhibited.
