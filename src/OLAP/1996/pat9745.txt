A mastic applicator system for delivering a mastic material to a surface in a precisely controlled manner. The system includes a mastic pump, a regulator receiving the mastic from the pump, a nozzle, and a jacketed hose assembly interconnecting the regulator output and the nozzle input. The hose assembly includes an end block having a flat sealing surface, and the end block and the body of the nozzle are fixedly secured together with the sealing surface on the end block in flush sealing contiguous relation to a flat sealing surface on the nozzle body so that a mastic passage and water passages in the end block may respectively sealingly communicate with a mastic passage and water passages in the nozzle body at the sealing surfaces. The mastic passage from the hose assembly to the nozzle outlet is thus totally internal and totally insulated so as to preclude the formation of cold plugs of mastic material during system shut down. Further, the water passages in the end block and nozzle body are arranged in encircling relation to the mastic passage as it passes through the end block and nozzle body so that the temperature of the mastic flowing through the end block and nozzle body may be carefully and precisely controlled by controlling the temperature of the water passing through the water passages.
