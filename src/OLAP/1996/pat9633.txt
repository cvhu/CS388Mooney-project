By a first homogeneous transformation matrix representing a position and orientation of a moving body in an absolute space, and a second homogenous transformation matrix representing a position and attitude of a manipulator in its operating space, position and orientation information of the moving body in the absolute space, and position and attitude information of the manipulator in its operating space are represented by a same representing method, and furthermore, the position and attitude of the manipulator are controlled on the basis of information of a third homogeneous transformation matrix representing the position and attitude of the manipulator including the position and orientation information of the moving body in the absolute space obtained on the basis of the first and second homogeneous transformation matrices. Since information of the third homogenous transformation matrix includes the position and orientation information of the moving body in the absolute space, the manipulator can be controlled at a desired position and attitude in the absolute space irrespective of a condition of traveling on standstill of the moving body, thus it is possible to control the position and attitude of the manipulator for operation while running the moving body.
