A palletizing system for placing articles from a conveyor onto two pallets. The palletizing system includes first and second substantially horizontally extending tracks each having a longitudinal axis. The first track adapted to move along the second track. At least two grippers engage at least one article to be palletized. A translatable carriage supports the grippers. The translatable carriage is movably mounted on the first track. Two pallet supports each support a respective pallet. Each of the pallet supports move along a vertical axis. A control controls the movement of the first track, the translatable carriage, the at least two grippers and the two pallet supports. The control is responsive to a predetermined instruction set such that after each of the grippers places at least one article in a layer on a respective one of the pallets, each of the pallets moves downwardly to permit each of the grippers to place at least one more article in a next layer on the respective pallet with minimal or no vertical movement of the grippers.
