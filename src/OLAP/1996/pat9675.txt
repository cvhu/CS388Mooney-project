A connector manipulating apparatus use a positioning mechanism to position a connector in a predefined location and orientation. A programmable positioning device or robot retrieves a connector from a first location using a locating tool, and places the connector in the positioning mechanism. After the positioning mechanism places the connector in a predefined location and orientation, the programmable positioning device moves the connector to a work location where conductors are attached to the connector.
Claims We claim: 1. A connector manipulating apparatus, said apparatus comprising: positioning means for positioning a connector in a predefined location, said positioning means having a rotating locator means for rotating said connector approximately 90 degrees, said rotating locator means having a first movable surface moving between an open position distal from a first opposite stationary surface and a closed position proximate to said first opposite stationary surface, and a stationary locator means with a second movable surface moving between an open position distal from a second opposite stationary surface and a closed position proximate to said second opposite stationary surface, said first and second stationary and movable surfaces forming a connector reception area when said rotating locator means is in a first position and said first and second movable surfaces are in said open positions, and said first and second stationary and movable surfaces positioning the connector in said predefined location when said first and second movable surfaces are in said closed positions; and programmable positioning means for moving said connector from a first location to said connector reception area. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said rotating locator means rotates said connector when said second moveable surface is in said open position and when said rotating locator means move from said first position to a second position, said first and second positions being approximately 90 degrees apart.
