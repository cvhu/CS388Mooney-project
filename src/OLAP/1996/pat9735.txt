A joint prosthesis for interconnecting the ends of adjoining bones includes a cushion of expanded PTFE having at least two facets for attachment to the bones. The cushion may or may not include stems for insertion into the bones. An optional sheath surrounds the non-facet surfaces of the cushion for preventing adherence of tissue. The motion of the prosthesis is defined or limited by the orientation of the facets and/or by the porosity of the cushion and/or by an insert within the cushion.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for making a joint prosthesis for interconnecting adjoining ends of a first bone and a second bone, said method comprising the steps of: providing a section of expanded PTFE having a first end, a second end and a midsection therebetween; heating the first and second ends of said expanded PTFE section to form first and second facets for attachment to said first and second bones. 2. The method as set forth in claim 1 wherein said heating step further comprises the step of: molding said first and second ends to form first and second stems integral with said first and second facets for insertion into corresponding openings formed in said ends of said first and second bones. 3. The method as set forth in claim 1 and further comprising the step of: enclosing said midsection of said expanded PTFE section in a sheath. 4. The method as set forth in claim 3 wherein said sheath is non-expanded PTFE.
