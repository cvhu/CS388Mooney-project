A bandolier for successively supplying a series of finished workpieces to a workpiece finishing machine which successively separates individual, finished workpieces from said bandolier and transfers the separate finished workpieces to an automated workpiece loading means and further discharges non-workpiece portions of said bandolier to waste during separation of said individual, finished workpieces, said finishing machine further including means for advancing said bandolier through said finishing machine, wherein said bandolier comprises a plurality of individual, finished workpieces assembled in the form of a continuous belt, said bandolier further including a plurality of planar webs extending longitudinally along said belt to define opposing outer longitudinal edges of said belt, the webs interconnecting said finished workpieces along the length of said belt, said finished workpieces having perimeters which are disposed along said belt interior of said webs, each finished workpiece having a bandolier planar engagement surface which engages said finishing machine loading means, the engagement surfaces being defined entirely within the perimeters of said workpieces, each of said webs being adapted to be discharged to waste as separate waste pieces when separated within said machine from said individual workpieces, said webs maintaining said individual workpieces in a spaced-apart order along said supply bandolier, said webs further including planar portions, the web planar portions and said workpiece presentation surfaces being disposed in different, horizontal spaced-apart planes, said web planar portions constituting clamping surfaces and indexing surfaces of said supply bandolier which lie in locations outside of said workpiece perimeters, the clamping surfaces engaging said machine bandolier advancing means and said indexing surfaces engaging an indexing means of said machine. 6. A supply feedstock for supplying successive, individual, workpieces to a workpiece finishing machine which successively separates single workpieces from the feedstock and subsequently successively presents the separated workpieces to a loading means after separation, said supply feedstock comprising: a plurality of individual workpieces assembled in the form a continuous coil having two outer longitudinal edges, each individual workpiece having a planar machine engagement surface for engaging a transfer means of said finishing machine after separation from said feedstock, said individual workpieces being disposed interior of the supply feedstock edges in spaced-apart order, said individual workpieces further being interconnected successively with one another by corresponding pairs of integral web portions extending only between pairs of individual workpieces, each of the web portions having longitudinal exterior and interior edges, said web portion longitudinal exterior edges being coincident with said coil outer longitudinal edges and said workpieces being disposed within said web portion longitudinal interior edges, each of said web portions being adapted to be driven to waste as a separate waste piece when separated within said finishing machine, said web portions including planar advancement surfaces for engaging a feedstock advancement means of said finishing machine to sequentially advance said feedstock through said finishing machine, said web portions further including means for engaging an indexing means of said finishing machine, the web portion planar advancement surfaces and said indexing means engaging means being disposed along the length of said coil between said web portion longitudinal interior edges and said coil outer longitudinal exterior edges exterior of said workpieces, whereby said finishing machine advancement means engages said web portion planar advancement surfaces and advances said feedback through said finishing machine and said finishing machine indexing means engages and indexes said feedstock within said finishing machine irrespective of the plane of said individual workpiece planar engagement surfaces. 7. A carrier strip of finished parts for use in a part processing machine which successively separates individual finished parts from the carrier strip within a singulation station of the part processing machine and transfers, by way of a transfer means, the separated, finished parts from the singulation station to a loading station, whereupon said separate finished parts are successively presented to an automated assembling means which removes said separate finished parts from said processing machine, said processing machine further including means for sequentially advancing said carrier strip to said singulation station and means for indexing the parts of said carrier strip with respect to said singulation station, each of said finished parts having a usable surface which engages the transfer means of said processing machine during and after separation from said carrier strip, said carrier strip comprising: a continuous strip of finished parts, the strip having a longitudinal axis and two generally parallel longitudinal outer edges, the finished parts being arranged in serial order along the longitudinal axis of said strip, each of said finished parts having multiple edges which cooperate to define a perimeter of said part, said part perimeters being disposed in locations within said strip outer edges, said strip further including means interconnecting said finished parts together extending lengthwise along said strip, the finished part interconnecting means including pairs of webs extending lengthwise only between pairs of said finished parts such that each pair of webs corresponds to a pair of finished parts within said strip, each of said webs having opposing inner and outer edges, the web exterior edges constituting said longitudinal outer edges of said strip, said webs further including planar portions disposed between said web inner and outer edges, the planar portions defining carrier strip advancement surfaces which are engaged by said processing machine carrier strip advancement means, said carrier strip advancement surfaces being disposed exterior of said finished part edges, whereby said processing machine advancement means engages said carrier strip advancement surfaces and advances said carrier strip through said processing machine irrespective of the plane of said part usable surfaces, said webs further including means for engaging an indexing means of said processing machine, said indexing means engaging means also being disposed within said carrier strip between said carrier strip longitudinal outer edges and said finished part edges, whereby said carrier strip may be indexed irrespective of the plane of said finished part usable surfaces. 8.
