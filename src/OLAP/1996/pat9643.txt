An apparatus and method for detecting anomalies in ferrous pipe structures is presented. A sensor having one or more sensor shoe members is placed in the interior of a ferrous pipe structure to be inspected. Each sensor shoe member has one or more magnetic field generating apparatus, with a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer for detecting magnetic fields in the region of the ferrous pipe structure adjacent to which the sensor shoe member is placed. Any magnetic fields in the pipe structure, whether imposed externally, or remnant, which are detected, are sensed and resolved into components in three mutually orthogonal directions for enhanced accuracy.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure, comprising: sensor means operably configured for positioning within and movement along an interior of the ferrous pipe structure, the sensor means including means for imposing one or more magnetic fields into the ferrous pipe structure operably associated with the sensor means, means operably disposed proximate the means for imposing one or more magnetic fields, for detecting magnetic fields emanating from the ferrous pipe structure whether due to remnant induction in the ferrous pipe structure or to magnetic fields imposed by the means to impose magnetic fields, the means to detect magnetic fields in the ferrous pipe structure being operably configured to detect components of the magnetic fields in the ferrous pipe structure, in at least three orthogonal directions, relative to the sensor means, means to generate data signals representative of at least one characteristic of the magnetic fields detected by the means to detect magnetic fields; control means for receiving and processing the data signals generated by the sensor means, and for converting the data signals into information from which a user may determine the presence and characteristics of anomalies in the ferrous pipe structure; means for communicating the data signals generated by the sensor means to the control means; and means for propelling the sensor means along the interior of the ferrous pipe structure; the sensor means including a sensor support frame; at least one sensor shoe member, operably configured to be placed sufficiently adjacent to an interior surface of the ferrous pipe structure so as to enable imposition of a magnetic field generated within the sensor shoe member onto the ferrous pipe structure and to enable detection, within the sensor shoe member, of magnetic fields in the ferrous pipe structure, and means for operably positioning the at least one sensor shoe member adjacent to the interior surface of the ferrous pipe structure, the means for imposing one or more magnetic fields further including at least two magnetic members, operably disposed in the at least one sensor shoe member, so as to selectively generate at least two magnetic fields at angles to one another, and selectively impose the magnetic fields into the pipe structure. 2. A method for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure, of the kind employing an apparatus, including a sensor to be positioned in and propelled along the interior of the ferrous pipe structure, wherein the sensor includes at least one sensor shoe member; the method for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure comprising the steps of: placing the at least one sensor shoe member within the interior of the ferrous pipe structure at a desired location to be inspected; measuring any present remnant magnetic field within the ferrous pipe structure, as a combination of at least three components extending along mutually orthogonal directions, with a magnetic field detecting apparatus disposed on the sensor shoe member; imposing a first magnetic field onto the ferrous pipe structure with a first magnetic field source disposed on the sensor shoe member and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure, as a combination of at least three components extending along mutually orthogonal directions; ceasing the imposition of the first magnetic field; imposing a second magnetic field of reversed polarity onto the ferrous pipe structure with the first magnetic field source and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure, as a combination of at least three components extending along mutually orthogonal directions; comparing the remnant magnetic field measured with the magnetic fields measured after imposition of the first and second magnetic fields to yield data representative of at least one characteristic of a resultant magnetic field evidencing the presence of one or more anomalies in the ferrous pipe structure at the desired location. 3. The method for detecting anomalies in a ferrous pipe structure, according to claim 2, further comprising the steps of: imposing a third magnetic field onto the ferrous pipe structure with a second magnetic field source positioned orthogonally to the first magnetic field source, on the sensor shoe member and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure, as a combination of at least three components extending along mutually orthogonal directions; ceasing the imposition of the third magnetic field; imposing a fourth magnetic field of reversed polarity onto a ferrous pipe structure with the second magnetic field source and simultaneously measuring any magnetic field emanating from the ferrous pipe structure, as a combination of at least three components extending along mutually orthogonal directions.
