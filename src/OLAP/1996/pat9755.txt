An electric soldering iron is disclosed in which a gas such as compressed air is electrically heated and then forced through a metallic soldering tip which is deeply slotted or finned for maximum heat transfer thereto. Soldering is then accomplished by applying the thusly heated tip to the workpiece. The slots may be formed to exhaust the hot gas forwardly over the tip to add heat to the workpiece and control the gaseous environment thereof; or the slots may be formed to exhaust the hot gas laterally or rearwardly to help in removing pollutants from the operator's environment.
Claims I claim: 1. A hot gas heated soldering tip for an electrically powered hand held soldering tool comprising: a metal body having an axial length and a front, working end including a solder contacting surface and a rear, heat take up end, said body being formed with axial-radial slots extending from its said rear end forwardly thereof to a point at least midway along its length, said slots providing a plurality of elongate heat absorbing surfaces of the character to absorb thermal energy in a heat exchange relation with hot gas impressed upon said rear end of said body and flowing therefrom along said slots, said body comprising a front portion terminated by said solder contacting surface of said working end, a mid portion of increased diameter, and a rear portion terminated by said heat take up end and having a further enlarged diameter portion forming a retaining shoulder, said slots extending from said rear end and at least partially through said mid portion. 2. The invention as set forth in claim 1 in which the forward edge of each of said slots is slanted significantly forwardly whereby said hot gas flowing forwardly along said slots is exhausted therefrom forwardly and over the outer surface of said front portion of said body.
