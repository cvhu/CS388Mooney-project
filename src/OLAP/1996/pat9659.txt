In one aspect of the present invention, an automatic control system for loading a bucket of a wheel loader is disclosed. The system includes a pressure sensor that produces pressure signals in response to the hydraulic pressures associated with one of the lift and tilt cylinders. A microprocessor receives the pressure signals, compares at least one of the pressure signals to a predetermined one of a plurality of pressure setpoints, and produces lift and tilt command signals in response to the pressure comparisons. Finally, an electrohydraulic system receives the lift command signals and controllably extends the lift cylinder to raise the bucket through the material, and receives the tilt command signals and controllably extends the tilt cylinder to tilt the bucket to capture the material.
