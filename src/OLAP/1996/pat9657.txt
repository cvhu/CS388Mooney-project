A wet indexer for receiving a cassette of wafers from a previous processing station that have not been allowed to dry. The wet indexer then keeps the wafers submersed in processing solution before and during indexed transmission to later cleaning stations.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a method of semiconductor wafer processing, including a semiconductor wafer scrubbing process, a method of preventing drying of said semiconductor wafers during delivery of said semiconductor wafers to said scrubbing process comprising the steps of: transporting a plurality of wafers in a cassette, while submerged in a boat of process solution, to a wet indexer having a tank and a platform for moving said cassette in said tank of said process solution and placing said cassette on said platform while said platform is in a raised position; detecting the presence of said cassette on said platform with a sensor; lowering said platform and said cassette into said tank of said process solution when said cassette is detected on said platform; then moving said platform and said cassette upwardly in said process solution to align individual ones of said plurality of wafers in said cassette with a wafer outlet from said tank when said individual wafers are needed for said scrubbing process; and motivating said individual wafers to move out of said cassette with a jet spray of said process solution from a plurality of nozzles and through said wafer outlet to said scrubbing process. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of: detecting the presence of said individual wafers in said wafer outlet with a second sensor; and inhibiting said jet spray of said process solution from said plurality of nozzles when said individual wafers are not detected in said wafer outlet. 3. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of: floating said individual wafers between a pair of guides connected to said wafer outlet with a flow of said process solution from a manifold to said scrubbing process including brushing stations.
