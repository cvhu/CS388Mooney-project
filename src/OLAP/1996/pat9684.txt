A disposable transportable reactor vessel can be prepared by modifying an eye-dropper pipette. A HDPE plug is inserted in one end of the pipette to permit selective passage of fluid while preventing resin flow. The pipette is looped into the shape of a u-tube and inserted into a holder such that the pipette is axially aligned with the holder to facilitate use in a robotic system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A reaction container for solid phase chemical synthesis utilizing solids, liquids and gases, the container comprising a one piece vessel and hollow stem combination, the vessel having a penetrable and at least partially resealable closed top end and a bottom end, the bottom end terminating in a hollow neck, the neck being integrally connected to the hollow stem, the hollow stem having an outlet opening, the neck having a hole therethrough connecting the inside of the vessel with the inside of the hollow stem, the neck containing a porous plug, said porous plug acting as a filter to retain solids within the vessel when the contents of the vessel are drained through the stem, the stem being looped around the vessel with the outlet opening pointing opposite the top end of the vessel, the stem being looped to prevent the contents of the vessel from exiting the outlet opening until pressure or vacuum is applied to said contents. 2. The reactor vessel of claim 1, wherein the vessel is prepared from high density polyethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene or glass. 3. The reactor vessel of claim 1, wherein the vessel is polypropylene. 4. The reactor vessel of claim 1, wherein the top end of the vessel is capable of being pierced with a cannula for the delivery of material to the vessel. 5. The reactor vessel of claim 1, wherein the porous plug is made of glass, sintered metal, nylon, polysulfone, polycarbonate or polytetrafluoroethylene. 6. The reactor vessel of claim 1, wherein the vessel and the stem are molded as a single unit.
