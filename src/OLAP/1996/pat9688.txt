This apparatus comprises a mechanically simple and lightweight tractor mechanism for use with a robotic object handling system to retrieve objects from a plurality of object storage locations. A finger gripper mechanism is used to grasp an object with a predetermined amount of force. The finger gripper mechanism is enclosed by a substantially rectangular box-like enclosure. The finger gripper mechanism is attached to a carriage which is moveable along one axis of the rectangular enclosure on a pair of tracks, which tracks are located one on each of two opposite sides of the interior of the enclosure. The carriage rides on these tracks and is transported from a retracted position entirely within the enclosure to an activated position juxtaposed to an opening in the enclosure by a tractor mechanism that makes use of a pair of toothed belts, each belt being juxtaposed along the length of one of the tracks on which the carriage slides. The use of the two toothed belts enables the precise positioning of the carriage and prevents the finger gripper mechanism from binding as it slides along the pair of tracks.
Claims We claim: 1. In an object handling system that includes a robotic manipulator for transporting objects, an object retrieval apparatus, located at an end of said robotic manipulator which positions said object retrieval apparatus opposite an object storage location, for retrieving an object from said object storage location, comprising: means for gripping said object to securely hold said object; means for translating said gripping means along a path of predetermined extent from a first position juxtaposed to said object storage location, where said gripping means contacts said object, to a second position in a direction to remove said object from its object storage location, comprising: carriage means, having first and second ends, for supporting said gripping means; first and second track means aligned parallel to each other and parallel to said path for receiving said first and second ends of said carriage means to guide said carriage means along said path; first and second belt drive means, substantially coextensive with said first and second track means, respectively, for displacing said carriage means in said direction, which is parallel to said first and second tracks means to cause said carriage means to move along said first and second track means in said direction, comprising: a rotatable drive gear means rotatably connected to said first and second track means and located proximate said second position; a rotatable idler pulley means, connected to said first and second track means and located proximate said first position, toothed belt means, forming a continuous loop encircling and engaging said drive gear means and said idler pulley means, means for rotating said drive gear means, to displace said toothed belt means along said path; wherein said carriage means comprises: first and second belt fastening means, located proximate said first and second ends of said carriage means, respectively, for securing said toothed belt means to said carriage means, each of said first and second belt fastening means comprising: a tab; a guide; wherein said guide is juxtaposed to said carriage end and said guide threads said toothed belt around said tab and back through said guide to engage at least one tooth of said toothed belt with another tooth of said toothed belt as it passes through said guide to thereby prevent movement of said toothed belt with respect to said carriage means. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said first and second track means each comprise a U-shaped channel manufactured from a material having a surface with a low coefficient of friction to enable a mating one of said first and second ends of said carriage means to slide in said channel. 3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said rotating means comprises a motor having a rotatable drive shaft that is connected to said drive gear means of said first and second belt drive means, causing said drive gear means of both said first and second belt drive means to rotate synchronously as said shaft rotates.
