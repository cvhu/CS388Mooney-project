A transporting system for a robot comprises a self-propelled wheeled platform which travels along a pair of tracks which establish a path between a series of spaced work stations. Accurate positioning of the platform at the work stations is achieved by a toggle-operated platform-mounted mechanism which lifts the platform above the track, using four precisely positioned locator blocks fixed to the tracks at each work station. These blocks provide a reaction and reference surface for the lifting mechanism and have formations which cooperate with formations on the carriage to cam the carriage into the desired longitudinal and transverse position as the carriage is lifted. The lifting mechanism also functions to fixedly clamp the carriage to the locator blocks once the final position has been achieved. Alternative embodiments permit precise elevational and lateral positioning at predetermined elongated positions along the track, while loosely gripping the elongated locator blocks, thereby permitting the robot to perform operations as it moves along the track, while still being precisely positioned and stabilized against overturning tendencies.
Claims I now claim: 1. In a transporter system for guiding and conveying a load along a predetermined path, a platform on which the load is precisely located and mounted, the platform having a plurality of platform-supporting wheels which roll along a pair of laterally spaced path-defining tracks, the position and dimensions of the tracks lacking the precision necessary to assure the desired accuracy of location of the load when it arrives at a predetermined station along the path, the improvement which comprises: platform lifting means mounted on the platform and adapted to lift the platform off the tracks after the platform has been approximately prepositioned at a predetermined station; locator block means precisely dimensioned and fixedly positioned at said station to the desired degree of accuracy, said locator block means having an underside with a downwardly facing surface which is engageable by an upwardly facing surface fixedly secured to and positioned beneath said platform, said engageable surfaces being precisely located and dimensioned whereby upward travel of said platform during platform lifting causes said surfaces to abut and firmly seat against each other when said platform has reached a precise predetermined elevation; said engageable surfaces including cooperating inclined ramp-like formations which initially engage each other only after said platform has been lifted off the tracks during upward movement of said platform, said ramp-like formations camming said platform in a horizontal direction relative to the tracks as said platform rises, to eliminate any undesired inaccuracy in the horizontal pre-position of said platform prior to said platform reaching its predetermined elevation. 2. The transporter system of claim 1 wherein said lifting means includes a toggle mechanism comprising a pair of toggle links extending generally upwardly and downwardly, respectively, from a common central pivot axis, said upwardly extending link being pivotally connected at its upper end to the platform for vertical movement therewith, said downwardly extending link being pivotally connected at its lower end to a lifting block which is slidably mounted on said platform for movement in a vertical direction relative thereto, said lifting block having a downwardly facing surface which is engageable with an upwardly facing surface on said locator block means; whereby actuation of said lifting means causes said downwardly extending link to slide said lifting block downwardly relative to the platform until it engages said fixed locator block means, whereupon continued movement of said toggle links toward their vertically aligned and fully extended position causes the platform to be lifted off the tracks; the engagement of said locator block means between said lifting block and said upwardly facing surface of said platform, when said platform reaches its predetermined elevation, causing said platform to be securely clamped to said locator block means in its final predetermined position. 3. The transporter system of claim 1 wherein said locator block means at said station includes at least three horizontally spaced locator blocks, all of said locator blocks having said platform elevation-establishing surfaces, each of said locator block means having a top surface which is engageable by said lifting means to provide a reactor surface against which said lifting means bears during lifting, the engagement of said locator blocks between said lifting means and said upwardly facing surfaces of said platform, when said platform reaches its predetermined elevation, causing said platform to be securely clamped to each of said locator blocks in its final predetermined position. 4. In a transporter system for guiding and conveying a load along a predetermined path, a platform on which the load is precisely located and mounted, the platform having a plurality of platform-supporting wheels which roll along a pair of laterally spaced path-defining tracks, the position and dimensions of the tracks lacking the precision necessary to assure the desired accuracy of location of the load when it arrives at a predetermined station along the path, the improved method of precisely locating and securing the platform after the platform has been approximately pre-positioned at a predetermined station comprising: lifting the platform off the tracks by platform-mounted lifting means; horizontally re-positioning the platform to its precise desired horizontal location during upward movement of the platform by fixedly and precisely positioning at the predetermined station a locator means having a camming surface which is engaged by an upwardly moving follower surface on the platform as the platform is raised by said lifting means; vertically positioning the platform at its precise desired elevation by the complete seating of said engageable camming and follower surfaces against each other at the conclusion of the upward travel of the platform; whereby the raising of the platform to bring said engageable camming and follower surfaces into butting contact establishes a precise predetermined horizontal and elevational location for the platform; and firmly clamping the platform in its desired position by gripping said locator means between said lifting means and said follower surface.
