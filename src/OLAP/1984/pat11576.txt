Screw clamp pin extractor for clamping pins of the type having a body fastened to a spreader lying between two tongs secured to a screw, and a nut acting against a spring. The extractor comprises a pneumatic motor, a nose portion engaging the clamp pin and carrying a sleeve brought into contact with an assembly of sheets, said extractor comprising moreover an internal mechanical system. When the motor rotates for unscrewing pins the device is locked on the pin and the nut of same can be unscrewed, and thereafter, the pin is extracted through the action of a jack. The extractor can be attached as desired either to the body of the usual manual screwing machine or a robotic head known in itself.
Claims I claim: 1. An extractor for screw clamping pins of the type comprising a body fastened to a spreader lying between two tongs secured to a screw and a nut acting against a spring, wherein the extractor comprises: a pneumatic motor which stops without air interruption during screwing and unscrewing; a nose portion positioned on the motor and comprising: a six-sided sleeve comprising a slidable ring with a hexagonal die, a locking sleeve having two pairs of radial apertures formed therein to permit rotation of 30.degree. with respect to a lock and terminated by a six-sided portion and which after rotation thereof provides for application under the points of the six-sided portion of the clamp pin, said lock being fixed both in rotation with respect to an outer body and in translation with respect to the locking sleeve through shaft screws, a protective ring engaged with an assembly of sheets, said outer body axially slidable on the sleeve under the effect of a piston, said piston being connected to the outer body through a stopping ring; a connecting sleeve to fasten the nose portion to the motor, a jack consisting of said piston with its chamber and fastened to the connecting sleeve, an inner guide for guiding in a translational motion the connecting sleeve and in a translational motion, the locking sleeve by means of the shaft screws, a spring for returning the jack, a drive motion means connected to the motor to impart rotation to a driving shaft, said shaft slidable axially in the driving means to permit control of said six-sided sleeve, two stop screws for bringing the motor to stall; a differential pneumatic device comprising: a differential proper, which carries a diaphragm defining a first chamber into which a conduit for motor pressure leads, with a conduit controlling the jack and a second chamber into which a conduit for the reference pressure of the motor leads, said conduit being possibly adjusted through a set screw, connecting means between the differential and the body to permit supply of the reference pressure, the arrangement of said motors, nose portion and differential being such that: the nose portion can be engaged on the clamp pin until the protective ring is brought into contact with the surface of the sheets assembly; when the motor rotates for unscrewing, it can, in a first period, drive the driving means which in its turn drives the driving shaft and the six sided sleeve, the latter then rotating in locking sleeve so as to drive it into rotation over 30.degree. due to frictions in the threaded portion, thereby resulting in the locking thereof on the clamp pin, and in a second period, it permits forward motion of said six sided sleeve by pushing on the shank of the clamp pin in unscrewing the nut, and at the end of the stroke, the putting into abutment of the stop screws at the bottom of a aperture in the driving means thereby causing the motor to stall and correlatively, the operation of the differential pneumatic device which at its turn, feeds the jack through the chamber, thereby causing extraction of the pin; when the motor rotates for screwing on, the jack is no longer fed and returns to its initial position, under the action of said spring while frictions in the threaded portions then provoke: in a third period, the unlocking of the clamp pin, in a fourth period, the return of all of the constitutive elements to their initial positions. 2. An extractor according to claim 1, wherein the conduits are intended for providing: inflow of the motor control pressure (PM) taken at the inlet to the pneumatic motor rotating for unscrewing, inlet of air to the jack taken at the differential pneumatic device, inlet of the reference pressure (PT) into the second chamber of the differential pneumatic device, The function of said inlets being such that: when the motor rotates to unscrew: the reference pressure (PT) is kept constant in the second chamber, the motor pressure (PM) is lower than reference pressure (PT) in the motor pressure chamber, hence interruption of supply to the jack; when the motor is brought to stall during unscrewing: the reference pressure (PT) is constant in the second chamber, the motor pressure (PM) is higher than reference pressure (PT) in the motor pressure chamber whereby the jack is fed; when the motor rotates to screw on: the reference pressure (PT) is constant in the second chamber, the motor pressure (PM) is nil in the motor pressure chamber, the pressure intake lying on the motor supply in the unscrewing, thereby cutting off supply to the jack, when the motor is brought to stall in the screwing on: the reference pressure PT is constant in the second chamber, the pressure of the motor (PM) is nil, hence cutting off supply to the jack. 3. An extractor according to claim 2, wherein the motor, the nose portion and the differential pneumatic device consititute a portable machine with gun handle and trigger, while the conduit of motor pressure and the conduit of jack feed are disposed in a bridge part which also affords mechanical protection for the operator's hand. 4. An extractor according to claim 2, wherein the motor, the nose portion, the differential pneumatic device and the conduits constitute an assembly carried by a robotic arm. 5. An extractor according to claim 1, wherein the jack is configured as a ring about the rotary part of the nose portion.
