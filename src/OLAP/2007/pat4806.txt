Compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of PTP1B. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding PTP1B. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of PTP1B expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of PTP1B are provided.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonucleotide consisting of the nucleobase sequence of SEQ ID NO: 166 wherein a ten deoxynucleotide region of said oligonucelotide is flanked on both the 5' and 3' ends with five 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) nucleotides, and wherein each internucleoside linkage of said oligonucleotide is a phosphorothioate and wherein each cytosine is a 5-methylcytosine. 2. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. 3. A method of inhibiting the expression of PTP1B in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues with the pharmaceutical composition of claim 2 so that expression of PTP1B is inhibited.
