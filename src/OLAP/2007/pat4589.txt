A control system for controlling processing of workpieces such as jewelry has gantry and gimbal units having x, y, z translational and x, y, z rotational degrees of freedom, the units carrying a gripper for holding a piece of jewelry. Drive motors are associated with each translational and rotational degree of freedom and an actuator operates the gripper. A controller is linked to the gantry and gimbal unit motors, the gripper unit actuator, and actuators associated with a series of work stations for carrying out processing operations such as lapping and grinding. The controller controls movement of the gripper unit from a start position to pick up a workpiece and move it along a programmed path between the processing stations, and controls operation of actuators at each processing station to process workpieces according to stored program instructions. A user input device provides optional operator control of the movement and processing for system training purposes.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of controlling a processing machine to process a plurality of workpieces, the processing machine having a gantry unit for x, y and z translational positioning of a workpiece, a gimbal unit mounted on the gantry unit for x, y and z rotational positioning of the workpiece, a main gripper unit for holding the workpiece from the inside or the outside and in horizontal or vertical orientations, and a plurality of spaced workstations for manipulating or processing the workpiece, the method comprising the following steps: setting up at least one desired trajectory of a workpiece from a storage tray through a selected series of end positions at workstations, the trajectory being associated with a selected workpiece style; setting up a series of parameters for processing each style of workpiece, the parameters comprising grinding force parameters and motor speeds; setting up a series of workpiece locations on a storage tray; controlling the gantry and gimbal motors to move the main gripper unit to a first position over a workpiece on the storage tray; controlling the gantry motors and gripper unit to move to the workpiece, grip the workpiece, and move the workpiece from the tray; controlling the gantry and gimbal motors to move the workpiece along the desired trajectory and stop at each end position; at each end position, controlling the tool at the workstation and the gantry and gimbal motors to carry out a processing operation at the workstation before continuing to move the workpiece along the desired trajectory to the next workstation; after the workpiece has been processed at the last workstation in the series, moving the workpiece to an end position; controlling the gripper unit to release the workpiece; controlling the gantry, gimbal and gripper units to move to the next workpiece position on the tray and to pick up the next workpiece to be processed according to the instructions associated with the style stored for that workpiece; and repeating the procedure until all workpieces on a tray have been processed. 2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one workstation has a lapping wheel, the method further comprising a lapping operation in which the workpiece is held in a desired orientation for lapping against the lapping wheel and the lapping wheel is operated to remove sprue from the workpiece. 3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the workstations comprise at least two grinding stations, each grinding station having a plurality of grinding wheels for grinding inside and outside surfaces, at least one of the grinding wheels comprising a lapping wheel, the method further comprising at least one automatic grinding procedure in which a predetermined sequence of lapping and grinding steps are carried out by successive lapping and grinding wheels at the grinding stations. 4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein each wheel is mounted on a movable tool bed, with a force controller for controlling force applied to the wheel, the method further comprising means for moving a workpiece to a position at which a selected surface would first contact the processing wheel if there were no sprues projecting outwardly from the surface, whereby any projecting sprue will displace the wheel from its zero position, detecting displacement of the wheel by a change in a sensor condition, and operating the processing wheel to perform a lapping operation until the sensor output indicates that the wheel has moved back to the zero position. 5. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a training process in which an operator controls the gantry, gimbal and gripper units using a manual input device, the training process comprising the steps of providing the operator with manual control of the gantry, gimbal and gripper units via an input device whereby the operator can move a first workpiece of a particular style along a user-selected trajectory through the machine, storing information regarding the user-selected trajectory as the user moves the gantry, gimbal and gripper units through a work envelope in the machine, and associating the stored trajectory information with a workpiece style entered by the user, storing data on each end point entered by the user along the trajectory, and storing processing parameters entered by the user for processing the workpiece at the workstation at each entered endpoint, whereby a series of trained processing sequences associated with a series of different style workpieces can be entered by an operator and stored for future automatic processing of workpieces. 6. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the steps of monitoring a series of workpiece processing operations and displaying a series of processing parameters to an operator. 7. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the monitoring step further comprises calculating an average amount of material removed from each workpiece during a processing sequence and displaying a running total amount of material removed for all workpieces which have been processed up to that point in the sequence. 8. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of taking a series of processing sequences which have been trained and stored on one processing machine and inputting the processing sequences on the controllers of one or more additional, identical processing machines for controlling processing of equivalent workpieces on the additional machines.
