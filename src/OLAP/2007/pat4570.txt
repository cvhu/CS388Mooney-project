A transfer system for use with a tool for processing a work-piece at low or vacuum pressure such as an ion implanter for implanting silicon wafers. An enclosure defines a low pressure region for processing of work-pieces placed at a work-piece processing station within the low pressure region. A two tier multiple work-piece isolation load lock transfers work-pieces from a higher pressure region to the lower pressure for processing and back to said higher pressure subsequent to said processing. A first robot transfers work-pieces within the low pressure region from the load locks to a processing station within the low pressure region. Multiple other robots positioned outside the low pressure region transfers work-pieces to and from the two tier work-piece isolation load locks from a source of said work-pieces prior to processing and to a destination of said work-pieces after said processing.

The transfer apparatus of claim 11 wherein the two end effectors are coupled to a movable carriage that moves the two end effectors simultaneously. 13. A process for serially processing multiple work-pieces at low pressure comprising: positioning two load locks adjacent to each other wherein each load lock has first and second atmosphere access openings that confront a region of atmosphere at different angles; providing a low pressure robot having two end effectors for moving work-pieces to a processing station from the two load locks; positioning multiple in-air robots in facing relationship with a specified atmosphere access opening of the two load locks for moving workpieces into and out of said two load locks; grasping an unprocessed work-piece with one in-air robot and moving said unprocessed work-piece into a first load lock of said two load locks through a first atmospheric load lock access opening having a facing relationship with said one in-air robot and placing the unprocessed work-piece inside the first load lock; lowering the pressure within the first load lock; removing the unprocessed work-piece from the first load lock with one end effector of said low pressure robot and moving the unprocessed work-piece to a processing station; placing an already processed work-piece obtained from the processing station with a second end effector of said low pressure robot into one load lock of said two load locks; raising the pressure within the one load lock; and removing the processed work-piece from the one load lock through a specified atmospheric load lock access opening. 14.
