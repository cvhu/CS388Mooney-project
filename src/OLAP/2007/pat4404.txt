In the articulated robot, types of teaching a moving track of the robot can be optionally selected. The articulated robot comprises: a switch for manually selecting a moving axis to move an arm section along the selected axis; a manual pulse generator generating pulses; first controller for controlling motors to linearly move a front end of the arm section a prescribed distance, which corresponds to number of pulses; an operating board including a selecting switch, which is used to move the arm section along the selected axis; second controller for automatically controlling the motors so as to move the arm section while the selecting switch is turned on; third controller for stopping the motors to freely move the arm section while the arm section is manually moved; and a switch for selecting a type of teaching action.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An articulated robot, comprising: an arm section including a plurality of arms, which are pivotably connected by a plurality of articulations; means for actuating the arms so as to move a front end of said arm section to an object position, which has been previously taught, in a rectangular coordinate system including three axes; means for manually selecting one of the axes of the rectangular coordinate system so as to move the front end of said arm section along the selected axis for teaching the object position; a manual pulse generator having a manually-operated rotary dial, said manual pulse generator generating pulses corresponding to a rotational angle of the rotary dial; first control means for controlling said actuating means so as to move the arms and linearly move the front end of said arm section a prescribed distance, which corresponds to number of pulses generated by said manual pulse generator, along the selected axis; an operating board including a selecting switch, which is used to move the front end of said arm section along the selected axis; second control means for automatically controlling said actuating means so as to linearly move the front end of said arm section along the selected axis while the selecting switch selects the axis and being turned on; third control means for stopping said actuating means so as to freely move the arms while the front end of said arm section is manually moved to the object position; and means for selecting said control means so as to select a type of teaching action. 2. The articulated robot according to claim 1, wherein said actuating means includes servo motors, and said second control means or said third control means stops at least one of the servo motors when the front end of said arm section contacts an article and intensity of an electric current passing at least one of the servo motors exceeds a prescribed current intensity.
