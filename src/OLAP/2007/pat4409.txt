This invention relates to putative known and unknown deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and amino acid sequences identified in one or more metabolic pathways that lead to dwarfism and stunting in plants and the use of these sequences in agriculture to create dwarf varieties of any plant species. This invention also relates to nucleic acids sequences and polypeptides that produce altered metabolism phenotypes in plants.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:47, wherein expression of said isolated nucleic acid in a plant results in a stunting phenotype of said plant. 2. A vector comprising the isolated nucleic acid of claim 1. 3. The vector of claim 2, wherein said isolated nucleic acid is operably linked to a plant promoter. 4. The vector of claim 2, wherein said isolated nucleic acid is in sense orientation. 5. A transfected plant comprising an isolated nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:47, wherein expression of said isolated nucleic acid in a plant results in a stunting phenotype of said plant. 6. The plant of claim 5, further comprising a vector comprising said isolated nucleic acid sequence. 7. A leaf from said plant of claim 5.
