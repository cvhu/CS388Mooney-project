A sheet package producing system for producing a sheet package having a predetermined number of sheets or X-ray films is provided. A cutting/stacking device forms the sheets by cutting continuous sheet at a regular length, and for stacking the sheets in the predetermined number. A covered sheet stack producing device inserts the stacked sheets into a protective cover, to obtain a covered sheet stack. A packaging device packages the covered sheet stack to obtain the sheet package. The cutting/stacking device, the covered sheet stack producing device and the packaging device are connected in series with one another. Those devices are balanced in line capacity balance relative to one another. In a preferred embodiment, the cutting/stacking device includes a supply module for feeding the continuous sheet. A cutter module cuts the continuous sheet to obtain the sheets. A stacker module stacks the sheets in the predetermined number.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A sheet package producing system for producing a sheet package having a predetermined number of sheets, comprising: cutting/stacking means for forming said sheets by cutting continuous sheet at a regular length, and for stacking only said individual sheets in said predetermined number directly on a pallet to form stacked sheets; covered sheet stack producing means for drawing said stacked sheets from said cutting/stacking means, placing a protective cover on said stacked sheets, at least one end portion of said protective cover being bent temporarily, and after placing said protective cover on said stacked sheets, folding said protective cover around at least a portion of said stacked sheets, to obtain a covered sheet stack; and packaging means for packaging one of said covered sheet stack in a packaging bag to obtain said sheet package; wherein said cutting/stacking means, said covered sheet stack producing means and said packaging means are connected in series with one another. 2. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 1, wherein said cutting/stacking means, said covered sheet stack producing means and said packaging means are balanced in line capacity balance relative to one another. 3. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 1, wherein each of said cutting/stacking means, said covered sheet stack producing means and said packaging means includes: plural modules; and a pallet, disposed in each of said plural modules, having a size predetermined in consideration of a maximum size of said sheets, for supporting said continuous sheet, said sheets, said protective cover, said covered sheet stack or said sheet package. 4. A sheet package producing system for producing a sheet package having a predetermined number of sheets, comprising: cutting/stacking means for forming said sheets by cutting continuous sheet at a regular length, and for stacking only said individual sheets in said predetermined number directly on a pallet to form stacked sheets; covered sheet stack producing means for drawing said stacked sheets from said cutting/stacking means, placing a protective cover on said stacked sheets, at least one end portion of said protective cover being bent temporarily, and folding said protective cover around at least a portion of said stacked sheets, to obtain a covered sheet stack; and packaging means for packaging said covered sheet stack in a packaging bag to obtain said sheet package; wherein said cutting/stacking means, said covered sheet stack producing means and said packaging means are connected in series with one another; wherein said protective cover includes transversely extending plural bending lines for defining first, second and third portions, said first portion being positioned on an end face of said stacked sheets, said second and third portions being positioned on upper and lower faces of said stacked sheets; and wherein said covered sheet stack producing means includes: folding means for folding said protective cover along said plural bending lines, and for squeezing said stacked sheets between said second and third portions, to obtain said covered sheet stack. 5. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 4, wherein said cutting/stacking means includes: supply means for feeding said continuous sheet; cutter means for cutting said continuous sheet to obtain said sheets; and stacker means for stacking said sheets in said predetermined number. 6. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 5, wherein said first handling means places said second portion of said protective cover on said stacked sheets; further comprising second handling means for turning over a sheet orientation of said stacked sheets to locate said protective cover under said stacked sheets, and then for setting said protective cover and said stacked sheets to said folding means; said folding means folds said protective cover by bending upward said third portion. 7. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 6, wherein said cutting/stacking means further includes synchronizing means for synchronizing said supply means, said cutter means and said stacker means with one another. 8. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 7, wherein said supply means, said cutter means and said stacker means include respectively drive power sources; said synchronizing means electrically synchronizes said drive power sources. 9. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 7, wherein said cutting/stacking means further includes: a drive power source incorporated in one of said supply means, said cutter means and said stacker means; and two transmission couplings for transmitting force of driving of said drive power source to remaining two of said supply means, said cutter means and said stacker means, to constitute said synchronizing means. 10. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 9, wherein said drive power source is incorporated in said cutter means. 11. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 6, wherein said covered sheet stack producing means further includes pre-bending means, actuated earlier than said folding means, for bending said protective cover temporarily by forcibly depressing said third portion; said first handling means sets said protective cover on said pre-bending means, and then places said protective cover on said stacked sheets. 12. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 11, wherein said second handling means includes: sheet chuck means for capturing said stacked sheets; moving robot arm means for moving said sheet chuck means; and rotating means, secured to said sheet chuck or said moving robot arm means, for rotating said sheet chuck means to turn over said sheet orientation. 13. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 12, wherein said first handling means includes: cover suction pad means for sucking said protective cover; cover moving robot arm means for moving said cover suction pad means. 14. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 6, wherein said packaging means includes: bag packaging means for packaging said covered sheet stack in a packaging bag; box packaging means for packaging said covered sheet stack in an outer box after packaging in said packaging bag, to obtain said sheet package. 15. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 14, wherein said bag packaging means includes: stack feeding means for feeding said covered sheet stack; first means for wrapping said covered sheet stack with bag material; and second means for folding a margin flap of said bag material wrapping said covered sheet stack, to form enclosure of said covered sheet stack in said packaging bag. 16. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 15, wherein said box packaging means includes: box forming means for forming said outer box by bending a plate material or sheet material; and box inserting means for inserting said covered sheet stack into said outer box after packaging in said packaging bag. 17. A sheet package producing system as defined in claim 6, wherein said cutting/stacking means further includes decurler means for eliminating or reducing a curling tendency of said continuous sheet.
