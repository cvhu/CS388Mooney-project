According to the invention, autonomous carriers or vehicles are efficiently navigated over a field of operation. The carriers are equipped to execute a selected procedure at more than one desired location on the field, and the navigation system of the invention directs the carrier to the location that is preferentially accessible to it, based on a defined criterion. After the carrier has executed the selected procedure at the location which is preferentially accessible to it, the navigation system directs the carrier to the location which is preferentially accessible to the carrier from the carrier's new position. This procedure is repeated until all the locations at which the procedure is to be executed have been reached. The task of determining a navigation route to a location that can be preferentially accessed is based on an efficient, structured search procedure of low computational complexity.
