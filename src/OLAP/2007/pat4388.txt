A method for determining the best entry point for a percutaneous procedure, such as with a biopsy needle, comprises selecting first and second arbitrary entry points on a patient; determining the three dimensional (3-D) orientation of the needle at the first arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the primary target; determining the 3-D orientation of the needle at the first arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the secondary target; determining the 3-D dimensional orientation of the needle at the second arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the primary target; determining the 3-D orientation of the needle at the second arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the secondary target; determining a 3-D line representing the intersection of a first plane containing the first arbitrary entry point, the primary target point, and the secondary target point, and a second plane containing the second arbitrary entry point, the primary target, and the secondary target point, whereby the 3-D line provides a position and orientation for the needle for performing needle biopsy of the primary target through the secondary target.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for determining the best entry point for a percutaneous procedure, given a primary target for biopsy and a secondary target through which a biopsy needle must pass on its way to said primary target, comprising: selecting a first arbitrary entry point on a patient; selecting a second arbitrary entry point on said patient, different from said first arbitrary entry point; determining the three dimensional (3-D) orientation of said needle at said first arbitrary entry point for pointing said needle at said primary target; determining the 3-D orientation of said needle at said first arbitrary entry point for pointing said needle at said secondary target; determining the 3-D dimensional orientation of said needle at said second arbitrary entry point for pointing said needle at said primary target; determining the 3-D orientation of said needle at said second arbitrary entry point for pointing said needle at said secondary target; determining a 3-D line representing the intersection of a first plane containing said first arbitrary entry point, said primary target point, and said secondary target point, and a second plane containing said second arbitrary entry point, said primary target, and said secondary target point, whereby said 3-D line provides a position and orientation for said needle for performing needle biopsy of said primary target through said secondary target. 2. A method for determining the best entry point of a needle for a percutaneous procedure, comprising: providing a primary target T and a secondary target U through which a needle must pass on its way to said primary target; selecting two arbitrary entry points F and G different from each other; performing a 3D alignment of said needle from each entry point to each target to determine the 3D orientations of the needle to reach said targets T and U from each entry point F and G, to provide (FT), (FU), (GT), and (GU); determining a direction (TU) that passes through both targets from the intersection of the planes .PI..sub.FTU=(FT)^(FU) and .PI..sub.GTU=(GT)^(GU); servoing a mechanical device holding the needle can servo the needle to direction (TU), wherein by lowering the servoed needle to the skin of the patient, said entry point for reaching target T through target U can be found.
