A method for determining the best entry point for a percutaneous procedure, such as with a biopsy needle, comprises selecting first and second arbitrary entry points on a patient; determining the three dimensional (3-D) orientation of the needle at the first arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the primary target; determining the 3-D orientation of the needle at the first arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the secondary target; determining the 3-D dimensional orientation of the needle at the second arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the primary target; determining the 3-D orientation of the needle at the second arbitrary entry point for pointing the needle at the secondary target; determining a 3-D line representing the intersection of a first plane containing the first arbitrary entry point, the primary target point, and the secondary target point, and a second plane containing the second arbitrary entry point, the primary target, and the secondary target point, whereby the 3-D line provides a position and orientation for the needle for performing needle biopsy of the primary target through the secondary target.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for use in conjunction with a C-arm imaging apparatus, for visual servoing of a needle in a plane in a fixed number of iterations, with: a given position of said C-arm being modeled on an image plane, a given target point for needle biopsy, a given entry point on a patient, and a given plane within which said needle can rotate around said given entry point, said method comprising: placing said needle in an arbitrary orientation around said given entry point, said orientation being associated with an angle .theta.1 with respect to an arbitrary reference direction; obtaining a 2-dimensional (2-D) projection image of said needle in, said image plane; measuring the position 11 of said 2-D projection image; rotating said needle around said entry point by an angle .DELTA..theta. to a position (.theta.1+.DELTA..theta.) in said given plane; measuring the position 12 of said 2-D projection image; rotating said needle around said entry point by an angle .DELTA..theta. to a position .theta.3=(.theta.1+2*.DELTA..theta.); measuring the position 13 of said 2-D projection image; locating 2-D points f and t in said 2-D projection image that are the respective 2-D projections of said target point and said entry point, said points f and t defining an image line It=(ft); calculating the cross-ratio c=(11, 12, 13, It); determining a 3-D angle .theta.t such that c=(.theta.1, .theta.2, .theta.3, .theta.t); and rotating said needle around said entry point by .theta.t from position .theta.3 in said given plane, whereby said needle is positioned in three dimensional space at said entry point along a direction such that said needle is visually aligned to 2-D projection image of said target in said image plane. 2. A method for visual servoing of a needle in a plane in a fixed number of iterations as recited in claim 1, wherein said step of locating 2-D points f and t is performed automatically. 3. A method for visual servoing of a needle in a plane in a fixed number of iterations as recited in claim 1, wherein said step of locating 2-D points f and t is performed manually.
