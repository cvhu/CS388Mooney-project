A smart camera system provides focused images to an operator at a host computer by processing digital images at the imaging location prior to sending them to the host computer. The smart camera has a resident digital signal processor for preprocessing digital images prior to transmitting the images to the host. The preprocessing includes image feature extraction and filtering, convolution and deconvolution methods, correction of parallax and perspective image error and image compression. Compression of the digital images in the smart camera at the imaging location permits the transmission of very high resolution color or high resolution grayscale images at real-time frame rates such as 30 frames per second over a high speed serial bus to a host computer or to any other node on the network, including any remote address on the Internet.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for distributed machine control, comprising: controlling a first actuator with a first control module, said first module including a first processor carrying out a program of instructions and generating a first set of signals for controlling said first actuator; controlling a second actuator with a smart camera module, said smart camera module including a second processor carrying out a program of instructions and generating a second set of signals for controlling said second actuator; linking said first set of signals through a first error current block disposed in said first module to said first actuator, said first error current block receiving and transmitting an error current loop signal and interrupting said first set of signals if said error current loop signal is interrupted; linking said second set of signals through a second error current block disposed in said smart camera module to said second actuator, said second error current block receiving and transmitting said error current loop signal and interrupting said second set of signals if said error current loop signal is interrupted; detecting an error condition; and interrupting said error current loop signal upon detection of said error condition. 2. The method in accordance with claim 1 wherein said detecting is performed at least by an emergency stop switch. 3. An apparatus for distributed machine control, comprising: means for controlling a first actuator with a first control module, said first module including a first processor carrying out a first program of instructions and generating a first set of signals for controlling said first actuator; means for controlling a second actuator with a smart camera module, said smart camera module including means for acquiring image data and a second processor carrying out a second program of instructions and generating a second set of signals for controlling said second actuator, said second program including instructions for processing the image data; means for linking said first set of signals through a first error current block disposed in said first module to said first actuator, said first error current block receiving and transmitting an error current loop signal and interrupting said first set of signals if said error current loop signal is interrupted; means for linking said second set of signals through a second error current block disposed in said smart camera module to said second actuator, said second error current block receiving and transmitting said error current loop signal and interrupting said second set of signals if said error current loop signal is interrupted; means for detecting an error condition; and means for interrupting said error current loop signal upon detection of said error condition. 4. The apparatus in accordance with claim 3 wherein said means for detecting includes at least an emergency stop switch.
