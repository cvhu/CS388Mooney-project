A composite wafer carrier according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises an operative portion formed of a first thermoplastic material and a support portion formed of a second different thermoplastic material. One of the operative portion and support portion is overmolded onto the other to form a gapless hermitic interface that securely bonds the portions together. The operative portion may be a transparent window, a portion of a latching mechanism or a wafer contact portion. Preferred embodiments of the invention include wafer carriers with said features, process carriers with said features and a process for manufacturing wafer carriers with said features.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A composite wafer carrier having a plurality of slots for holding wafers in an axially aligned configuration, the wafer carrier comprising: a container portion comprised primarily of plastic and having a front opening, a plurality of shelves for holding wafers, and a bottom positioned base, the base having three elongate machine interfaces, each oriented inwardly; a door configured to latch onto and sealingly close the front opening; and the composite wafer carrier formed from at least two different melt processable plastics, the two different plastics injection molded in an overmolding process, the two plastics bonded together during said overmolding process. 2. The wafer carrier of claim 1, wherein the one of the melt processable plastics comprises polycarbonate and the other of the melt processable plastics comprises polyetheretherketone. 3. The wafer carrier of claim 1, wherein each of the three machine interfaces are bonded within the base by overmolding. 4. The wafer carder of claim 1, wherein said shelves comprise an overmolded portion.
