Nozzle apparatus and method for affixing an annular transponder unit to an annular surface of a tire includes a nozzle block having an adhesive conduit extending therein to an inward end; a transverse channel open along an outward side and extending into the block, the channel being dimensioned for close receipt segment by segment of the annular transponder unit therein; and at least one adhesive port opposite the open channel side in fluid communication with the channel and the adhesive conduit inward end. The block channel open side is positioned opposite the annular tire surface and the adhesive port is positioned to direct adhesive material therefrom into the block channel to surround a segment of the annular transponder unit located within the channel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for attaching by adhesive application an annular transponder unit segment to an annular tire surface, the method comprising the steps: a. positioning an adhesive application nozzle block adjacent the tire annular surface, the nozzle block having an adhesive conduit extending therein to an inward terminal end, a transverse channel of predetermined profile and dimension extending into the nozzle block and open along a side facing the annular tire surface, and at least one adhesive port positioned in the channel opposite the open channel side and the port extending in fluid communication between the channel and the adhesive conduit inward end; b. moving the annular transponder unit axially into the block channel segment by segment; and c. surrounding each segment with adhesive introduced into the channel through the adhesive port. 2. A method according to claim 1 further comprising the steps of advancing the annular transponder unit sequentially through the nozzle block segment by segment and sequentially adhering each segment within the nozzle block against the annular tire surface.
