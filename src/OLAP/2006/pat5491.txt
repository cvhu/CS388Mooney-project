Insecticidal (dihalopropenyl) phenylalkyl substituted dihydrobenzofuran and dihydrobenzopyran derivatives of Formula I are disclosed. These compounds provide unexpected insecticidal activity across a spectrum of insect pests combined with desirable physical properties including improved photostability. ##STR00001## wherein x and y are integers independently selected from 0 or 1; and B is a bridging group *--(CR.sup.16R.sup.17).sub.q--(CR.sup.18R.sup.19).sub.r--(CR.sup.20R.sup.- 21).sub.s--L.sub.t--(CR.sup.22R.sup.23).sub.u--(CR.sup.24R.sup.25).sub.v--- (CR.sup.26R.sup.27).sub.w--, where the asterisk denotes attachment at A; and q, r, s, u, v and w are integers independently selected from 0, 1 and 2; and t is an integer selected from 0 and 1. A, D, E, G, M, R through R.sup.11, and R.sup.16 through R.sup.27, inclusively, are fully described herein. In addition, compositions comprising an insecticidally effective amount of at least one compound of formula I and methods of controlling insects by applying said compositions to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present are also disclosed.

A composition comprising an insecticidally effective amount of a compound of claim 1 and at least one agriculturally acceptable extender or adjuvant. 6. The insecticidal composition of claim 5, further comprising one or more second compounds selected from the group consisting of pesticides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers and soil conditioners. 7. A method of controlling insects, comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition of claim 5 to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present. 8. A method of controlling insects, comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition of claim 6 to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present.
