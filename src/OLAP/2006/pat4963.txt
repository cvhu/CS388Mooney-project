Manufacturing tools having a base and a working surface, such as trim steels, flange steels and die inserts, are formed by fabricating or casting a substrate out of a relatively ductile, low wear-resistant metal and forming the working surfaces such as cutting edges, flanging surfaces, die surfaces and die inserts by depositing layers of relatively hard, wear-resistant materials to the substrate by closed-loop direct-metal deposition or laser cladding. A multi-axis numerically controlled robot may be used to position and move a beam and deposition material over large substrates in forming such tooling.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of fabricating or improving an object, comprising the steps of: providing a substrate composed of aluminum, the substrate having a working surface forming a tool; depositing a layer of molybdenum or an alloy thereof on the working surface using a closed-loop direct-metal deposition (DMD) process of the type wherein powder is fed to a laser-induced melt pool to create a deposit having a dimension that is optically monitored; and wherein the layer of molybdenum or an alloy thereof has a very low solubility in the aluminum. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the substrate forms part of a die cast die, stamping die, trim steel, flange steel or die insert. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the working surface includes a cutting edge, flanging surface, die surface, or die insert.
