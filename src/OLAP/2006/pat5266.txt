A brain machine interface for decoding neural signals for control of a machine is provided. The brain machine interface estimates and then combines information from two classes of neural activity. A first estimator decodes movement plan information from neural signals representing plan activity. In one embodiment the first estimator includes an adaptive point-process filter or a maximum likelihood filter. A second estimator decodes peri-movement information from neural signals representing peri-movement activity. Each estimator is designed to estimate different aspects of movement such as movement goal variables or movement execution variables.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A brain machine interface, comprising: (a) a first estimator to decode movement plan information from neural signals representing plan activity; (b) a second estimator to decode peri-movement information from neural signals representing peri-movement activity; and (c) a combiner to combine said decoded movement plan information and said decoded peri-movement information into control signals for said machine in said brain machine interface. 2.
