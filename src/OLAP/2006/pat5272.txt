A pill dispensing device and method in which the part of the device 10 which comes into contact with the pills is disposable so as to prevent cross pill contamination. The device 10 is a disposable, columnar insert comprised of a funnel-like ingress aperture 16 for receiving the articles to be counted and dispensed, tapering to a constriction 18 to limit the passageway and diverging out to a cylindrical tube 20 that segregates the tablets/capsules from the counting/dispensing apparatus. The present invention 10 also provides for an additional element wherein the egress aperture 26 tapers to a smaller cylindrical aperture diametrically conforming to the aperture 18 at the opposing distal end for dispensing the medication directly into a vial 14.
Claims I claim: 1. A disposable pill dispensing chute, comprising: a) an elongated cylindrical body having first and second opposing ends to permit pills to pass from the first end to the second end; b) a funnel inlet having first and second opposing ends, being disposed on said first end of said cylindrical body, wherein said second end of said funnel inlet is joined to said first end of said cylindrical body, wherein said first end of said funnel inlet is enlarged for receiving pills therein, wherein said first end of said funnel inlet tapers toward said second end of said funnel inlet; c) a narrowed throat section connecting said second end of said funnel inlet to said first end of said cylindrical body and forming a smooth transitional curvature surface both inside and outside of said chute from said funnel inlet to said cylindrical body, wherein said throat section has a smaller diameter than said cylindrical body to permit the pills to be segregated; and d) an outlet being disposed on said second end of said cylindrical body to permit pills to exit from the cylindrical body, wherein said funnel inlet, said cylindrical body and said narrowed throat section form a unitary member. 2. The pill dispensing chute of claim 1, further comprising an egress aperture being disposed on said second end of said cylindrical body, wherein said egress aperture has a smaller diameter than said cylindrical body for dispensing medication directly into a vial. 3. The pill dispensing chute of claim 2, wherein said egress aperture has a diameter substantially the same as the diameter of said constriction. 4. The pill dispensing chute of claim 3, wherein the pill dispensing chute comprises polyethylene. 5. A disposable pill dispensing chute for use with and in combination with a pill dispensing device for directing and counting pills for a medication vial, comprising: a) said dispensing chute being a disposable elongated cylindrical body having first and second opposing ends to permit pills to pass from the first end to the second end, a funnel inlet having first and second opposing end, being disposed on said first end of said cylindrical body, wherein said second end of said funnel inlet is joined to said first end of said cylindrical body, where said first end of said funnel inlet is enlarged for receiving pills therein, wherein said first end of said funnel inlet tapers toward said second end of said funnel inlet, and a narrowed throat section connecting said second end of said funnel inlet to said first end of said cylindrical body and forming a smooth transitional curvature surface both inside and outside of said chute from said funnel inlet to said cylindrical body, wherein said funnel inlet, cylindrical body and said narrowed throat section form a unitary member, and wherein said narrowed throat section has a smaller diameter than said cylindrical body to permit the pills to be segregated; b) an outlet being disposed on said second end of said cylindrical body to permit pills to exit from the cylindrical body; and c) a dispensing device having a receiving aperture for receiving said dispensing chute; wherein said dispensing chute extends through said receiving aperture of said dispensing device for discharging said pills directly into a medication vial disposed below said receiving aperture.
