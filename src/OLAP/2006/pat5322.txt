The present invention relates to apparatuses and methods for calibrating relative motions of moveable parts using plurality of balls, rods, and liner encoders which form configurations to measure multiple translational, angular and squareness errors simultaneously.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for use in calibrating relative motions of moveable parts comprising: a plurality of balls rotatably mounted to a plurality of telescopic rods, and a plurality of linear encoders mounted inside the telescopic rods which form configurations to measure changes in the length or movement of the balls in relation to the telescopic rods to calculate multiple translational, angular and squareness errors simultaneously, wherein at least one of the balls is arranged to contact a surface found on a measuring site, and wherein the apparatus allows measurements to be performed on non-flat surfaces of the measuring site as the plurality of balls at the measuring site can be oriented in a nonplanar arrangement. 2. A method of calibrating relative motions of moveable parts comprising contacting the moveable part to the apparatus of claim 1 so that the linear encoders relay data which measures translational, angular and squareness errors, and calibrating the moveable part based upon the data collected. 3. An apparatus for use in calibrating relative movements of parts of a machine comprising: a plurality of balls rotatably mounted to a plurality of telescopic rods, linear encoders mounted inside the telescopic rods which linear encoders measure changes in length or movement of the ball in relation to the telescopic rods, a top platform contacted to at least one ball, and a bottom platform formed by at least one of the balls being magnetically adhered to a surface on a measuring site, to form a configuration which measures multiple translational, angular and squareness errors simultaneously for planar and non-planar movements of a machine, wherein the plurality of balls can be oriented in a non-planar arrangement at the top platform or bottom platform. 4. A method of calibrating a machine tool for translational, angular and squareness errors comprising mounting the apparatus of claim 3 between members to be measured wherein the bottom platform of the apparatus is mounted on the machine tool and the top platform of the apparatus is mounted on a fixed position of the machine tool, after the apparatus is mounted the machine tool is programmed to move and the apparatus measures the motion of the machine tool for translational, angular and squareness errors.
