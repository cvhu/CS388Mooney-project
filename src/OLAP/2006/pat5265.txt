A robot apparatus 1 is a four-legged mobile robot, and leg units 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D are connected to the left and side parts in the front and rear sides of a body unit 2. Ahead unit 4 is connected to the front end of the body unit 2. The head unit 4 has a mouth (jaw) part capable of biting and holding a toy 200 shaped like a bone. The mouth part is constituted by upper and lower jaw parts, and adopts a structure capable of biting and securely holding a bite part 203 of the bone 200. A CPU as a control part executes programs according to an image recognition processing algorithm for recognizing the bone 200, a bone-bite control algorithm for biting the bone, and a bone-bite detection algorithm for detecting the bone.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A robot apparatus which autonomously makes actions, based on external environment, comprising: image pick-up means for picking up an image of an object in the external environment; calculation means for calculating a circularity of a label included in image data based on the image picked up by the image pickup means; and distinguish means for distinguishing a characteristic part of the object, depending on the circularity calculated by the calculation means, wherein when the object is a bone-shaped toy having a rod-like bite part to be bitten and held by a mouth part formed in a head unit of the robot apparatus, and two side parts each formed in a substantially triangular shape and both formed respectively at two ends of the toy with the bite part interposed between the two side parts, circularities of labels based on a color applied to predetermined areas of the bite part and the two side parts are calculated by the calculation means, and the distinguish means distinguishes the bite part and the side parts from each other, based on the circularities, wherein a circularity in the range of 0.55 through 0.6 indicates one of the two ends of the toy and a circularity in the range of 0.15 through 0.5 indicates the rod-like bite part of the bone.
