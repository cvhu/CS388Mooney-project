Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of MyD88. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding MyD88. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of MyD88 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of MyD88 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 20 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 900 through 943 of the coding region of a nucleic acid molecule encoding MyD88 (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein said compound has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NOS: 73, 74, 75, 76, or 77, and wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid molecule encoding MyD88 and inhibits the expression of MyD88. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of MyD88 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro compound of claim 1 so that expression of MyD88 is inhibited.
