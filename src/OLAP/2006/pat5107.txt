The present invention provides a system and process providing variable access to, as well as quick and accurate dispensing of, numerous selected reagents from a mass storage arrangement. According to one embodiment, an array of reagent dispensers is supported over a movable platform assembly. The platform assembly aligns a designated receiving receptacle under a selected dispenser of the array so that a respective reagent can be dispensed therein. Advantageously, the apparatus and process can be carried out under the control of a programmed computer.

A system for storing and dispensing a plurality of reagents, comprising: an addressable array of reagent dispensers; a gate mechanism at an outlet region of each dispenser, each state mechanism being independently operable between (i) an opened condition permitting passage of a respective reagent through said outlet region and (ii) a closed condition wherein said passage is blocked; a first support disposed adjacent said array; a second support mounted on said first support, said second support having a holding area for receiving a plurality of receptacles, wherein (i) said first support is variably positionable to permit placement of a fixed target region thereof in alignment with any selected one of said dispensers in said array, and (ii) said second support is variably positionable to permit placement of any selected target site of said holding area in alignment with said fixed target region; and a release mechanism positionable near anyone of said gate mechanisms and operable to apply a secondary force of a magnitude and direction effective to override the normal biasing force so that the gaze mechanism assumes the opened conditions; wherein each gate mechanism is subject to a normal biasing force that urges it to the closed position, thereby preventing the passage of reagent through a respective outlet region, and each gate mechanism includes a magnetic pinch valve having first and second magnets (i) that are pivotally mounted in facing relation at a respective outlet region and (ii) that have lower, confronting north and south pole regions, respectively, that are normally urged toward one another by magnetic forces so as to pivot said magnets to the closed condition. 5. The system of claim 4, wherein said release mechanism is an electromagnet positioned adjacent said radiation-beam pathway, said electromagnet operable to generate said secondary force as a magnetic force having south and north pole portions disposed to attract the north and south pole lower regions of said first and second magnets, respectively, so that said lower regions pivot away from one another. 6. A system for storing and dispensing a plurality of reagents, comprising: an addressable array of reagent dispensers: a gate mechanism at an outlet region of each dispenser, each gate mechanism being independently operable between (i) an opened condition permitting passage of a respective reagent through said outlet region and (ii) a closed condition wherein said passage is blocked; a first support disposed adjacent said array; a second support mounted on said first support, said second support having a holding area for receiving a plurality of receptacles, wherein (i) said first support is variably positionable to permit placement of a fixed target region thereof in alignment with any selected one of said dispensers in said array, and (ii) said second support is variably positionable to permit placement of any selected target site of said holding area in alignment with said fixed target region; and a release mechanism positionable near any one of said gate mechanisms and operable to apply a secondary force of a magnitude and direction effective to override the normal biasing force so that the gate mechanism assumes the opened condition; wherein each gate mechanism is subject to a normal biasing force that urges it to the closed position, thereby preventing the passage of reagent through a respective outlet region, said release mechanism is a rod adapted for motion from a retracted position to an extended position adjacent said radiation-beam pathway, said rod adapted to apply said secondary force as a mechanical force by engaging and deflecting said lever, when moved to said extended position, so that said protrusion is at least partially withdrawn from said outlet region, and each gate mechanism is a resiliently deflectable lever having a protrusion normally extending into a respective outlet region. 7. A system for storing and dispensing a plurality of reagents, comprising: an addressable array of reagent dispensers; a gate mechanism at an outlet region of each dispenser, each gate mechanism being independently operable between (i) an opened condition permitting passage of a respective reagent through said outlet region and (ii) a closed condition wherein said passage is blocked; a first support disposed adjacent said array; a second support mounted on said first support, said second support having a holding area for receiving a plurality of receptacles, wherein (i) said first support is variably positionable to permit placement of a fixed target region thereof in alignment with any selected one of said dispensers in said array, and (iii) said second support is variably positionable to permit placement of any selected target site of said holding area in alignment with said fixed target region; and a guide member located over said fixed target region of said first support, between said dispenser array and said second support; said guide member (i) disposed for movement with said first support to a position under any selected dispenser, and (ii) configured to channel reagent dispensed from such dispenser to a selected site on said holding area of said second support. 8.
