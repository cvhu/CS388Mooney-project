A Microscope Imaging System (CMIS) with intelligent controls is disclosed that provides techniques for scanning, identifying, detecting and tracking microscopic changes in selected characteristics or features of various surfaces including, but not limited to, cells, spheres, and manufactured products subject to difficult-to-see imperfections. The practice of the present invention provides applications that include colloidal hard spheres experiments, biological cell detection for patch clamping, cell movement and tracking, as well as defect identification in products, such as semiconductor devices, where surface damage can be significant, but difficult to detect. The CMIS system is a machine vision system, which combines intelligent image processing with remote control capabilities and provides the ability to auto-focus on a microscope sample, automatically scan an image, and perform machine vision analysis on multiple samples simultaneously.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for examining specimens comprising the steps of: a) providing a video microscope having a holder for specimens and a camera located so as to be focused on said holder and providing an output representative of the electronic image of said specimen; b) providing a light source operatively connected to said video microscope for illuminating said specimens being held in said holder; c) providing a robotic system responsive to electrical signals and operatively connected to and for positioning said video microscope; d) providing a computer having a display terminal and operatively connected to said output of said camera and providing said electrical signals to said robotic system said computer having operating programs comprising routines for providing machine vision techniques for scanning, identifying, detecting and tracking and displaying on said display terminal selected characteristics and features of said specimen, wherein said robotic system is a Cartesian robotic system and wherein said video microscope has a camera and wherein said routines for providing machine vision techniques comprise a routine for automatically focusing on a specimen comprising the steps of: a) attaching to said Cartesian robotic system a micro-positioner having a vertical axis with a top limit and a three (3) stage arrangement, coarse, medium and fine each having a defined step size; b) placing said specimen being examined in said holder; c) causing said video microscope to generate an electronic image comprised of spatial frequencies, wherein each spatial frequency being the rate of brightness transition; d) performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on said electronic image so as to decompose said electronic image into its fundamental frequency components with each component having magnitude and phase quantities, said FFT performing transforming said electronic image from a spatial domain to a frequency domain; e) examining said FFT electronic image by displaying the magnitudes of the frequency components; f) positioning the vertical axis of said micro-positioner to its top level so that said camera is located away from said specimen by a first predetermined distance; g) positioning in separate steps said micro-positioner so that said camera moves downward and toward said specimen at a predetermined number of step sizes of said coarse stage, while at the same time examining that the FFT pattern being displayed becomes further dispersed as said camera moves downward by each of said course steps; h) determining the sum of the magnitude of the FFT patterns, while at the same time determining that the sum of the magnitudes decreases as said camera moves downward by each of said course steps; i) repeating steps g) and h) for said micro-positioner at the defined step size of said medium stage; and j) repeating steps g) and h) for said micro-positioner at the defined step size of said fine stage so that said electronic image is focussed with desired contrast. 2. The method according to claim 1, wherein steps g) and h) are repeated before step i) thereof with said repeating being done with said coarse defined step size being decreased by a factor of about ten (10). 3. The method according to claim 1, wherein said predetermined number of step sizes of said coarse stage is ten (10) and each step size of said coarse step is about 10 mm.
