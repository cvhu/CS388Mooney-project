Apparatus and method for holding an uncompressed bundle of product from the top with a vacuum assisted end effector and then simultaneously compressing the bundle from all sides at the same time with thin compression plates located about the periphery of a vacuum assisted end effector to form an evenly compressed product bundle that is then placed in a container with the compression plates between the product and the container walls. Once the bundle is received in the container, vacuum is removed; the inward force of the compression plates released and the compression plates removed vertically from between the product and the containers walls. The simultaneous compression from all sides provides even distribution of forces on the product and ensures that all product is compressed or deformed to the same degree. Using the apparatus described herein to place the bottom of the products gently onto the inside bottom of the container is further advantageous.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic end effector for picking product and building a bundle of product retained thereon comprising: A) a rectangular vacuum assisted plenum having opposing outer peripheral edges comprising; i) a vacuum plenum fed by a vacuum inlet; plurality of plenum apertures in said vacuum plenum; and ii) in said plenum apertures, contact activated vacuum assisted suction cup assemblies comprising: a) a cylindrical bellowed or corrugated cup defining a plurality of interconnected bellows or corrugations of alternating, coaxial large and small diameter areas, said bellowed cup comprising; A) an open contact end; and B) a valve end including a valve seat and a peripheral flange for engagement with said plenum apertures; iii) a threaded articulatable valve stem having first and second extremities; iv) a valve plate intermediate said open contact end and said valve end in one of said large diameter areas attached to said first extremity and including apertures therein for the passage of a vacuum; and v) a valve stop threaded onto said valve stem at said second extremity said valve stop being of a size to engage said valve seat and including a central threaded aperture; and vi) compressive plates rotatably mounted along each of said outer peripheral edges; said plurality of compressive plates being rotatable downward from said outer peripheral edges to compress a bundle of product retained on said vacuum assisted plenum. 2. The robotic end effector of claim 1 Wherein the peripheral flange is integral with said valve end.
