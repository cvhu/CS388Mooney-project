A portable robotic system having a folding carriage is disclosed. The carriage in one embodiment includes two legs and a lateral stabilizer. The folding legs and stabilizer allow the carriage to be maneuvered into a plurality of open and closed positions. In the open positions, the legs and stabilizer are spaced apart to support the robotic system during operation. In the closed positions, the legs and stabilizer and substantially parallel to one another. In one closed position with one leg or stabilizer extended to within reach of a person, the carriage may be rolled like a dolly. In another closed position with one leg or stabilizer collapsed against the carriage, the carriage may be carried like a suitcase. Methods of folding and transporting a robotic system and carriage are also disclosed.
