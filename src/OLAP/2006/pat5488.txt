A method to move an accessor capable of accelerating at a.sub.MAX. The method calculates a first velocity profile where the accessor travels a distance in the minimum time interval. That first velocity profile requires a first maximum acceleration change. The method calculates a second velocity profile, where that second velocity profile includes a second maximum acceleration change, where that second maximum acceleration change is less than the first maximum acceleration change. The method determines if the accessor reaches a.sub.MAX using the second velocity profile. If the accessor does not reach a.sub.MAX using the second velocity profile, then the method moves the accessor using the first velocity profile. Alternatively, if the accessor does reach a.sub.MAX using the second velocity profile, then the method moves the accessor using the second velocity profile.
