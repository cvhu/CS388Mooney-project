Friction stir fastener equipment and method in which a series of friction stir rivets are rotatably mounted in a supply station and a computer controlled arm terminating in a rotating working head having special gripping jaws that precisely locates and grips a selected rivet. The arm then moves the rotating rivet and progressively drives it into the work until a frictionally heated and plasticized zone of material around the shank of the rivet begins to solidify. The jaws then release the rivet from the drive so that the rivet rotation decelerates to zero. Sufficient hardening of the zone effects the completion of one stir riveting cycle which may be automatically repeated.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of friction plunge riveting work parts together with friction stir rivets each having an upper drive head and a shank portion depending therefrom comprising the steps of mounting said rivets in rest positions in a support defining a supply station so that the heads thereof are externally accessible and the shank portions thereof rotatably mount into the support, moving a rotating rivet gripping and installation tool from a start position into operative drive engagement with said head portion of a selected one of said rivets for rotating said selected rivet in said support, operating said tool for removing said selected rivet from said support while continuously rotating said selected rivet, subsequently moving said selected rivet to a work station and into frictional engagement with said work parts to effect the penetration of said work parts with the shank portion thereof by frictional heating and plasticizing of a zone of material therein that extends around said shank portion penetrating said work parts, and releasing said selected rivet from said tool while said tool is rotating and allowing said rivet to diminish in rotational speed to zero while said material of said plasticized zone solidifies around said shank to complete the friction plunge riveting of said work parts together with said selected rivet. 2. The method of friction stir riveting of claim 1 and then further comprising the step of moving said rotating rivet gripping and installation tool back to said supply station and into operative drive engagement with another selected one of said rivets to initiate another friction plunge riveting of said work parts together. 3. A method of friction stir riveting overlapping metal parts together at a work station with friction stir rivets each having a drive head and a said shank portion depending therefrom comprising the steps of mounting a plurality of friction stir rivets in rest positions for subsequent rotation and pickup with respect to a support defining a supply station so that the heads thereof are externally accessible and the shank portions thereof depending therefrom rotatably mount into said support, moving a rotating rivet gripping and apply tool from a start position into operative engagement with the head portion of a selected one of said rivets to grip and rotate said selected rivet while in said supply station, operating said rotating rivet gripping and apply tool to move said selected rivet to said work station so that the shank portion thereof is in loaded frictional contact with the upper surface of said overlapping metal parts at said work station, continuing the rotation of said rivet under load to effect the penetration of said shank portion of said rivet into said parts effecting limited plasticizing of material thereof in a frictionally heated zone extending around said shank portion and releasing said rivet from said rotating gripping and apply tool to allow said rivet to diminish in rotational speed to zero and said plasticized material to fully solidify around said shank of said rivet so that said parts are securely friction stir riveted together. 4. The method set forth in claim 3 and further comprising the step of automatically cycling said tool from said work station back to said supply station while said tool is rotating to target rotate and pick up a second rivet therefrom and cycling said rotating tool with said second rivet aboard back to said work station and into loaded frictional contact with said overlapped parts for the joining of said parts with said second rivet by friction stir riveting. 5. The method set forth in claim 3 wherein said application tool has opposing jaws movable between open head receiving and closed head gripping positions, each of said rivets have profiled heads and a centered drive and shaped drive associated therewith, and wherein said application tool has a depending driver rotatable therewith and terminating in a driving end for operatively engaging said centered and shaped drive and further comprising the step of rotatable driving said rivet from shared input torque from said driving end and from said opposing jaws of said gripping application tool.
