Apparatus is disclosed for handling rolls (12) of web material, the rolls being of the type having a hollow core (60) on which a length of the web is wound, the core having opposite ends (68) extending axially beyond the material. The rolls are supported on a rack (10) with their axes of rotation essentially horizontal. Devices such as a general purpose programmable robot (22) having a special tool (26, 32-114) are provided for removing rolls from the rack and placing them on a transfer stand (28, 116-174) adjacent a processing apparatus (30). The transfer stand extends toward the processing apparatus and pushes a fresh roll from its chuck (174) onto the chuck (186) of the processing apparatus.
