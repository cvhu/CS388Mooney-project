The illumination system of the present invention is used with an object handling system to selectively illuminate a predefined target area in a manner that creates a dark area outside of the target area. This illumination system is used in conjunction with an object handling system that contains a plurality of object storage locations located in an array format, such that object storage locations are adjacent to each other both vertically and horizontally. In order to precisely illuminate a selected object storage location and not the adjacent object storage locations, the illumination system of the present invention angularly orients a pair of illumination devices with reference to the object storage locations in order to create shadows outside of a selected object storage location while illuminating the selected object storage location. This is accomplished by displacing the illumination sources such that their angular relationship with respect to the selected object storage location causes the selected object storage location and the object placed therein to cast a shadow beyond the boundaries of the selected object storage location.
Claims I claim: 1. In an object handling system that includes a plurality of object storage locations arranged in an array configuration, with each object storage location being juxtaposed to at least one other object storage location and having an end face spaced from an end face of said at least one other object storage location and also including a gripper mechanism positionable opposite a selected object storage location for manipulating an object stored in said selected object storage location, an object illumination apparatus attached to said gripper mechanism comprising: vision system means having a line of sight, and having a field of vision that is focused on a location adjacent said gripper mechanism, which location includes said selected object storage location when said gripper mechanism is positioned opposite said selected object storage location, for generating an image of said selected object storage location; first illumination source means, located on a first side of said vision system means, for generating a first beam of light and aligned to side illuminate said selected object storage location, wherein said first beam of light crosses said line of sight prior to reaching said selected object storage location; second illumination source means, located on a second side of said vision system means, opposite said first side, for generating a second beam of light and aligned to side illuminate said selected object storage location, wherein said second beam of light crosses said line of sight prior to reaching said selected object storage location; and wherein said first and second light beams side illuminate said selected object storage location, causing said selected object storage location to cast shadows on at least one of said juxtaposed object storage locations. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said gripper mechanism has a top and a bottom, which comprise said first and second sides and are substantially aligned with a corresponding top and bottom of said selected object storage location when said gripper is positioned opposite said selected object storage location, said first illumination source means is attached to said gripper mechanism proximate said top thereof and aligned to illuminate an area proximate said bottom of said selected object storage location. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 wherein said second illumination source means is attached to said gripper mechanism proximate said bottom thereof and aligned to illuminate an area proximate said top of said selected object storage location. 4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said gripper mechanism has a top and a bottom, which comprise said first and second sides and are substantially aligned with a corresponding top and bottom of said selected object storage location when said gripper is positioned opposite said selected object storage location, said second illumination source means is attached to said gripper mechanism proximate said bottom thereof and aligned to illuminate an area proximate said top of said selected object storage location. 5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said first and said second illumination source means each comprise a plurality of light emitting diodes, whose operating wavelength substantially corresponds to an operating wavelength of said vision system means. 6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said plurality of light emitting diodes are configured into a rectilinear array. 7. In a magnetic tape cartridge handling system that includes a plurality of rectangular box-shaped cartridge storage locations arranged in an array configuration, with each cartridge storage location being juxtaposed to at least one other cartridge storage location and having an end face spaced from an end face of said at least one other object storage location and including a vision system calibration target on one corner thereof juxtaposed to one of said at least one juxtaposed cartridge storage locations, and also including a gripper mechanism positionable opposite a selected cartridge storage location for manipulating a magnetic tape cartridge stored in said selected cartridge storage location, an illumination apparatus attached to said gripper mechanism comprising: vision system means having a line of sight, and having a field of vision that is focused on a location adjacent said gripper mechanism, which location includes said selected cartridge storage location when said gripper is positioned opposite said selected cartridge storage location, for generating an image of said selected cartridge storage location; first illumination source means, located on a first side of said vision system means, for generating a first beam of light and aligned to side illuminate said selected cartridge storage location, wherein said first beam of light crosses said line of sight prior to reaching said selected cartridge storage location; second illumination source means, located on a second side of said vision system means opposite said first side, for generating a second beam of light and aligned to side illuminate said selected cartridge storage location, wherein said second beam of light crosses said line of sight prior to reaching said selected cartridge storage location; and wherein said first and second light beams side illuminate said selected cartridge storage location, causing said selected cartridge storage location to cast shadows on said one juxtaposed cartridge storage location to delineate said calibration target from said one juxtaposed cartridge storage location. 8. The apparatus of claim 7, said gripper mechanism has a top and a bottom, which comprise said first and second sides and are substantially aligned with a corresponding top and bottom of said selected cartridge storage location when said gripper is positioned opposite said selected cartridge storage location, said first illumination source means is attached to said gripper mechanism proximate said top thereof and aligned to illuminate a section of a cartridge housed in said selected cartridge storage location proximate said bottom of said selected cartridge storage location. 9. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said second illumination source means is attached to said gripper mechanism proximate said bottom thereof and aligned to illuminate a section of a cartridge housed in said selected cartridge storage location proximate said top of said selected cartridge storage location. 10. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said gripper mechanism has a top and a bottom, which comprise said first and second sides and are substantially aligned with a corresponding top and bottom of said selected cartridge storage location when said gripper is positioned opposite said selected cartridge storage location, said second illumination source means is attached to said gripper mechanism proximate said bottom thereof and aligned to illuminate a section of a cartridge housed in said selected cartridge storage location proximate said top of said selected cartridge storage location. 11. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein said first and said second illumination source means each comprise a plurality of light emitting diodes, whose operating wavelength substantially corresponds to an operating wavelength of said vision system means. 12. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein said plurality of light emitting diodes are configured into a rectilinear array.
