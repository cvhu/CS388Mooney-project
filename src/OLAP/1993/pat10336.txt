A wafer storing package according to claim 2 wherein the retractable wafer clamping portion is movable toward and away from the ledge portion, and a spring portion urging the clamping portion toward the ledge portion. 4. A wafer storing package according to claim 2 wherein the retractable wafer clamping portion is movable toward and away from the ledge portion, the clamping portion comprising a movable operating peg portion protruding downwardly from the ledge portion to be operated from below the ledge portion. 5. A wafer storing package for storing a single silicon wafer, comprising an enclosure means comprising a U-shaped frame portion comprising a semicircular side portion and substantially parallel end portions, the enclosure means also comprising a top panel portion traversing the side and end portions of the frame portion and being affixed thereto, the frame portion and top panel portion defining and embracing a wafer compartment having an open bottom portion opposite to said top panel portion and also having a closed side portion adjacent the semicircular side portion of the frame portion and an open side portion adjacent the end portions of the frame portion, the frame portion also comprising a wafer supporting ledge portion extending around said semicircular side portion of the frame portion and confronting the top panel portion in spaced relation, the ledge portion being inclined to minimize the area of engagement between the wafer and the ledge portion, the spacing between the top panel portion and the ledge portion being greater than the thickness of the wafer to permit limited movement of the wafer in the compartment, the wafer compartment corresponding to the shape of the wafer and having a width between the closed and open side portions to confine substantially the entire width of the wafer, the U-shaped frame portion comprising an access slot portion through the semicircular side portion and ledge portion of the frame portion to obtain access to the edge of the wafer lying on the ledge portion for moving the wafer. 6. A wafer storing package for storing a single silicon wafer, comprising an enclosure means comprising a U-shaped frame portion comprising a semicircular side portion and substantially parallel end portions, the enclosure means also comprising a top panel portion traversing the side and end portions of the frame portion and being affixed thereto, the frame portion and top panel portion defining and embracing a wafer compartment having an open bottom portion opposite to said top panel portion and also having a closed side portion adjacent the semicircular side portion of the frame portion and an open side portion adjacent the end portions of the frame portion, the frame portion also comprising a wafer supporting ledge portion extending around said semicircular side portion of the frame portion and confronting the top panel portion in spaced relation, the ledge portion being inclined to minimize the area of engagement between the wafer and the ledge portion, the spacing between the top panel portion and the ledge portion being greater than the thickness of the wafer to permit limited movement of the wafer in the compartment, the wafer compartment corresponding to the shape of the wafer and having a width between the closed and open side portions to confine substantially the entire width of the wafer, said enclosure means comprising a robot handle on the top panel portion and protruding therefrom and away from the wafer compartment, the frame portion having a thickness between the ledge portion and the open bottom of the compartment which is greater than the dimension by which the robot handle protrudes above the panel portion. 7. A package for storing a single silicon wafer, comprising enclosure means comprising, a generally U-shaped frame portion comprising a partially circular wafer embracing side portion and an open side portion through which a wafer may be inserted and removed, the enclosure means also comprising a top panel portion on the frame portion and traversing the partially circular side portion and open side portion, the frame portion and panel portion defining a single wafer-shaped compartment, the enclosure means also comprising an open bottom portion adjacent both side portions of the frame portion to obtain access into the compartment and to a wafer contained therein, the partially circular side portion of the frame portion comprising a wafer supporting ledge portion confronting and spaced from the panel portion to permit limited movement of the wafer between the ledge portion and the panel portion, a wafer retainer portion on the panel portion adjacent said open side portion and traversing said compartment to obstruct movement of the wafer into and out of the compartment, a plurality of releasable wafer clamping portions spaced from each other on the frame portion and confronting the ledge portion, a robot handle portion on the panel portion to be gripped by a robot for moving the package, and a retainer operating portion on the enclosure adjacent the handle portion to be operated by the robot. 8.
