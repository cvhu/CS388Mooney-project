The method and apparatus for the manufacture of product subassemblies by computer programmed robots is an end effector fixture assembly, or geometry station wherein at least two individual elements of the particular subassembly are dimensionally positioned relative to one another between a lower base fixture and an upper fixture of the end effector fixture assembly to establish a net location therebetween. The robot manipulates the end effector fixture assembly and transports the two individual elements located therein to a work performing station located within a defined region of the robot to perform work on the subassembly.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of manipulating at least two objects and performing work on said at least two objects while said at least two objects are mounted in a unitary frame structure, said method comprising the steps of: providing a support structure; positioning a first frame structure, having a first locating means thereon on said support structure; positioning said at least two objects on said first locating means of said first frame structure, thereby establishing a net location between said at least two objects; positioning a second frame structure, having a second locating means thereon on said first frame structure, thereby retaining said at least two objects at said net location atop said support structure; interengaging said first frame structure with said second frame structure, thereby establishing a unitary frame structure having said at least two objects accurately located therein and maintained at said net location atop said support structure; while maintaining said at least two objects at said net location within said unitary frame structure, lifting and transporting said unitary frame structure from said support structure to a work performing device located within a defined work region surrounding said support structure, and using said work performing device to perform work on said at least two objects; and while maintaining said at least two objects at said net location within said unitary frame structure, returning said unitary frame structure to said support structure after work has been performed on said at least two objects by said work performing device. 2. The method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising, after returning said unitary frame structure to said support structure, the steps of: securing said at least two objects in said second frame structure; disengaging said first frame structure from said second frame structure; and transporting said second frame structure with said at least two objects secured therein to a remote discharge station located within said defined work region surrounding said support structure and unloading, from said second frame structure at said remote discharge station, said at least two objects upon which work has been performed by said work performing device.
