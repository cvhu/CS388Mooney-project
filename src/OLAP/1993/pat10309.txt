A robot for installing a fixed length of weather stripping in a body opening. The robot in a preferred embodiment includes an arm movable in a predetermined path, a powered variable angular displacement rate pressure roller mounted on the end of the arm for tracing the body opening and applying the fixed length to the opening, a calibration table for storage of preprogrammed datums for the pressure roller angular displacement rate and weather stripping feed rates for a plurality of locational segments along the body opening during an application cycle, a controller for delivering a signal representative of the calibration table preprogrammed datums to the pressure roller, an encoder for determining the actual angular displacement rate of the pressure roller, and an encoder for determining the actual feed rate of the weather stripping. The controller determines the differential in the actual weather stripping feed rate from the preprogrammed datum in the calibration tables for a first locational segment of the body opening and signals the pressure roller to modify the pressure roller rate of angular displacement to integrally compensate within a later segment for the weather stripping feed rate differential in the first segment and any intervening segments.
