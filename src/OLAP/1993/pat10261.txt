The finger gripper mechanism includes two fingers hingeably attached to a support and operable by means of a spring to grasp an object with a predetermined amount of force and a solenoid to open the fingers and release the object. Also attached to the fingers is a loading linkage mechanism that exerts a closing force on the fingers in excess of the predetermined closing force when the object is attempted to be removed from between the fingers. The loading linkage mechanism dynamically adjusts the magnitude of the force applied to the fingers as a function of the force applied to the object to remove it from between the fingers. Therefore, the greater the force placed on the object by an external source, the greater the force applied by the loading linkage mechanism to retain the object between the fingers. The finger gripper mechanism makes use of a spring and a simple lightweight solenoid to operate the fingers and thereby requires little energy to operate, while the loading linkage mechanism is requires no additional energy to operate.
