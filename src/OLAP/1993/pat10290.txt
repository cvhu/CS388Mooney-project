An artificial neural device comprising; a data storage and processing device for encoding data in an abstract form representative of stimulus-response patterns onto said data storage device whereby multiple stimulus-response patterns are superimposed onto said data storage device by said processing device; a device for decoding a previously encoded response associated with a stimulus when said data storage and processing device is stimulated by said stimulus.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. In a plurality of computing nodes wherein each of said plurality communicates with others of said plurality by means of bidirectional serial communication means, and wherein each node comprises: (a) local memory storage means for storing data mapped onto said memory storage means; (b) micro-processing means including: (i) processor means; (ii) a plurality of data input means for receiving stimulus signals; (iii) a plurality of data output means for transmitting response signals; (iv) memory interface means for interfacing said micro-processing means with said local memory storage means; (c) said micro-processing means including: (i) means for encoding data onto said local memory storage means by translating sets of associated stimulus and response signals, received by said data input means from real values into a complex value represented by a vector phase angle and a magnitude exhibited within the generalized complex number domain and generating a matrix representing stimulus-response patterns for each set of associated stimulus and responses signals, whereby each said stimulus-response pattern is superimposed onto said local memory storage means; (ii) means operable for decoding a response, associated with a stimulus signal received by said data input means, from said matrix of stimulus-response patterns encoded on said local memory storage means, to generate a response signal associated with said stimulus signal through said data output means. 2. In a plurality of computing nodes as claimed in claim 1 wherein each said computing node is connected with four computing nodes by bidirectional serial communication means. 3. In a plurality of computing nodes as claimed in claim 1 which are connected so as to present a Boolean Hypercube configuration defined by the following structure: (a) each computing node labelled by a binary value; (b) the number of digits in the binary value indicate the number of communication paths to other computing nodes; (c) the total number of digits in the binary representation is expressed as an exponent to base 2 indicate the total number of computing nodes possible within the hypercube structure; (d) each computing node communicates to only the remote nodes labelled by a binary calue, whose logical result when forming an exclusive OR with the local computing nodes binary label produces a binary value having only one bit set. 4. In a plurality of computing nodes as claimed in claim 1 wherein said processing means includes means for sigmoid preprocessing of the stimulus input field of said matrix. 5. In a computing node as claimed in claim 1 wherein said processing means includes means for Hermitian preprocessing of the stimulus input field of said matrix, wherein an Hermitian matrix [H] represents the stimulus input set by a linear (1 by N) matrix [S] and forms the matrix product of [S] with its conjugate transpose: wherein the stimulus field is expanded to N.sup.2 terms to thereby permit a proportionately larger number of stimulus to response mappings to be enfolded onto the identically same mapping substrate, while maintaining statistically similar analog error values on response recall.
