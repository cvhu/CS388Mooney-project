Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of G-alpha-i3. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding G-alpha-i3. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of G-alpha-i3 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of G-alpha-i3 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human G-alpha-i3, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human G-alpha-i3. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 8, 10, 11, 13, 20, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22, 26, 30, 28, 29, 31, 37, 33, 38, 39, 35, 42, 43, 45, 46, 19, 23, 24, 32, 34, 36, 41, 44 or 47. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 8, 10, 11, 20, 14, 16, 18, 26, 30, 28, 29, 31, 33, 39, 42, 43, 45 or 46. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 13. The composition of claim 12 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 14. The composition of claim 12 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 15. A method of inhibiting the expression of G-alpha-i3 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of G-alpha-i3 is inhibited.
