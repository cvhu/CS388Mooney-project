A hand held vacuum or venturi effect pickup tool is disclosed having a body and a forwardly extending tubular member, which may be curved, carrying a rotatable pickup head on its forward end. A rotatable nozzle is carried by the forward portion of the body and an elastomeric tube connected to the nozzle and to the pickup head and extending loosely over the tubular member retains the pickup head to the tubular member and provides a rotational, positioning control of the pickup head by rotating the nozzle about its connection to the body of the tool.
Claims I claim: 1. A rotatable hand held pickup tool for small parts comprising: a body having a central longitudinal axis along its forward portion and containing an air chamber and having an input air port connected to its rearward portion; a forward nozzle portion carried by the forward portion of said body and having a freedom of rotation about said axis and including a finger operable wheel portion to effect such rotatation and a forwardly extending coupler shank portion having a first, outer diameter and a second, inner diameter; a rigid tubular member carried by siad forward portion of said body and extending forwardly therefrom beyond said nozzle portion and having a third, outer diameter less than said second diameter: a pneumatic pickup head having a reduced diameter coupler shank portion extending rearwardly therefrom and having an inner diameter slightly greater than said third diameter, said coupler shank being disposed concentrically over and supported by the forward end of said tubular member with freedom of rotation thereabout; a length of deformable elastomeric tubing having a non-deformed inner diameter greater than said third diameter and less than each of said first and second diameters and having a length to extend over the outer surfaces of said coupler shank portions of said pickup head and said nozzle portion whereby when disposed thereover, said nozzle portion and pickup head are both longitudinally connected and rotationally coupled together; and a finger operated valve means carried by said body, disposed contiguously to said finger operable wheel portion and selectively coupling, pneumatically, said air chamber and tubular member.
