Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 88-3314 of the coding region of human pI3K p85 (SEQ ID NO: 1), wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human pI3K p85. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a truncated form of human PI3K p85. 11. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 33, 40, 41, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 32, 37, 42 or 43 which inhibits the expression of human pI3K p85. 12. The antisense compound of claim 11 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 14. The antisense compound of claim 13 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 15. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 16. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 17. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 18. The antisense compound of claim 17 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 19. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 20. A method of inhibiting the expression of human pI3K p85 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human pI3K p85 is inhibited. 21. A method of inhibiting the expression of human pI3K p85 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 3 so that expression of human pI3K p85 is inhibited.
