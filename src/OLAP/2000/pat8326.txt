The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human methionine aminopeptidase 2 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human methionine aminopeptidase 2 is inhibited. 14. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 or 87 which inhibits the expression of human methionine aminopeptidase 2. 15.

The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 17. The antisense compound of claim 16 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 18. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 19. The antisense compound of claim 18 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 20. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 21. The antisense compound of claim 20 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 22. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 23. A method of inhibiting the expression of human methionine aminopeptidase 2 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 14 so that expression of human methionine aminopeptidase 2 is inhibited.
