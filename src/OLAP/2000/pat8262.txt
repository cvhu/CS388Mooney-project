A substrate processing system that includes a deposition chamber having a reaction zone, first and second electrodes, a mixed frequency RF power supply including a low frequency RF power source and a high frequency RF power source. The high frequency RF power supply provides enough power to form a plasma from a process gas introduced into the reaction zone and the low frequency RF power supply is configured to supply an asymmetrical waveform to either said first or second electrodes to bias the plasma toward the substrate.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for depositing a film on a substrate in a substrate processing chamber, said method comprising the steps of: introducing one or more process gases via a gas inlet manifold into a reaction zone of the substrate processing chamber; forming a plasma from said one or more process gases by applying high frequency RF power to said gas inlet manifold; and biasing said plasma toward the substrate with an asymmetric low frequency RF waveform. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said asymmetric low frequency RF waveform is a sawtooth waveform. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said asymmetric low frequency RF waveform has a duty cycle of between 10 and 50 percent. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein said process gases comprise silane, ammonia and nitrogen. 5. The method of claim 4 wherein said asymmetric low frequency RF waveform has a frequency of less than 400 kHz. 6. The method of claim 4 wherein said asymmetric low frequency RF waveform has a frequency between 50 and 220 kHz. 7. The method of claim 1 wherein the plasma is biased toward the substrate to promote ion bombardment of the substrate.
