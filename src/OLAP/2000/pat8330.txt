The present invention provides an integrated, fully automated, high-throughput system for two-dimensional electrophoresis comprised of gel-making machines, gel processing machines, gel compositions and geometries, gel handling systems, sample preparation systems, software and methods. The system is capable of continuous operation at high-throughput to allow construction of large quantitative data sets.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of detecting macromolecules in an electrophoresis gel which method comprises the steps of placing said gel in a porous holder having two major surfaces that are porous and an internal cavity with dimensions similar to said gel, suspending said gel in said porous holder in a solution or a sequence of solutions such that said macromolecules are rendered detectable, and detecting said macromolecules. 2. A method of detecting macromolecules in an electrophoresis gel wherein said gel comprises two major surfaces, which method comprises the steps of placing said gel in a holder having an internal cavity with dimensions similar to said gel, suspending said gel in a solution or a sequence of solutions wherein said two major surfaces are exposed to said solution or sequence of solutions such that said macromolecules are rendered detectable, and detecting said macromolecules. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein greater than 50% of each of said two major surfaces is exposed to said solution or sequence of solutions. 4. A method of detecting macromolecules in an electrophoresis gel which method comprises the steps of placing said gel in a holder having an internal cavity with dimensions similar to said gel, suspending said gel in a sequence of solutions such that said macromolecules are rendered detectable, wherein said sequence of solutions are present in distinct containers, and detecting said macromolecules.
