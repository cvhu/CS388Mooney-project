By making the fluid seal an integral part of either the filter element or the filter housing, the reliability of fluid filter assemblies is improved. In addition, the process for manufacturing filter assemblies and their individual components can be more easily automated.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An improved fluid filter assembly of (a) a filter element, consisting of a cartridge filter of granular adsorbents or a hollow fiber or spiral wound membrane element, having an outer surface, (b) a housing having an inner surface spaced from the outer surface of the filter element and (c) a seal between the outer surface of the filter element and the inner surface of the housing which directs fluid through the filter element, wherein the improvement comprises the seal being a foamed material incorporated as an integral part of the outer surface of the filter element or the inner surface of the housing. 2. The fluid filter assembly of claim 1 in which the filter element is a spiral wound membrane element. 3. The fluid filter assembly of claim 1 in which the fluid seal is comprised of a foamed polyurethane material. 4. The fluid filter assembly of claim 1 in which the fluid seal is an integral part of the outer surface of the filter element and the inner surface of the housing. 5. The filter element (a) of claim 1 in which the fluid seal is incorporated as an integral part of its outer surface. 6. The filter element of claim 5 in which the filter element is a spiral wound membrane element. 7. The filter element of claim 5 in which the fluid seal is comprised of a foamed polyurethane material. 8. The filter assembly housing (b) of claim 1 in which a fluid seal is incorporated as an integral part of its inner surface. 9. The filter assembly housing of claim 8 in which the fluid seal is comprised of a foamed polyurethane material.
