Robotic machines, such as mobile manipulators, are controlled by a relatively high-level script while changes in the environment are accommodated by including parameters in the script. Sensors, manual inputs, and other software can be used as sources of data for setting the values of the parameters. The high-level script includes sets of instructions with each set defining movement of one portion of the robotic machine, such as a joint of the manipulator. The several sets of instructions are executed concurrently in a primary script. One or more secondary scripts, each containing concurrently executed sets of instructions may be executed when an abnormal condition is detected. The movements performed by the robotic machine are generally defined by the instructions, but precisely how the movements are performed is determined by the values of the parameters. By using parameterized scripts, it is unnecessary to compute and track trajectories.

A method for controlling complex automated movement by a manipulator, the manipulator having a plurality of links connected at joints and at least one sensor providing perceptual information to software, the software being operable to monitor movement of the manipulator based on the perceptual information and to generate commands for controlling movement of the manipulator, the method comprising the steps of: executing event based pre-stored instructions, including at least one parameter generally defining the complex automated movement, said pre-stored instructions including a primary script formed of concurrently executing scripts; utilizing the software to determine a value for at least one parameter during the executing of the pre-stored instructions; obtaining the value for the at least one parameter from any of a sensor input, a data file, and other software; determining the order to execute the sets of instructions based on the values of the parameters; and controlling the manipulator based upon the determined order. 2.
