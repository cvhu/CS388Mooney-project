Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Ets-2. The compositions comprise antisense com ounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Ets-2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Ets-2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Ets-2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 1711-2128 of the 3'-untranslated region, nucleobases 354-1670 of the coding region, or nucleobases 16-274 of the 5'-untranslated region of human Ets-2, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human Ets-2. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 13, 14, 16, 19, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32, 35, 38, 40, 43, 44, 11, 21, 34, 37, 41, 42 or 47. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequen.e comprising SEQ ID NO: 13, 16, 19, 27, 28, 35, 38, 40 or 43. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A method of inhibiting tihe expression of human Ets-2 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Ets-2 is inhibited.
