A mounting mechanism for mounting a fastener applicator on a positioning mechanism. The mounting mechanism incorporates fluid actuators for applying compensating forces and turning moments that counteract the effects of the applicator weight by bringing the forces and turning moments into substantial equilibrium or predetermined directional bias so that the applicator is movable by a minimal force. The fluid actuators thereby enabling final correction of the applicator position and orientation prior to fastener application by movement of the fastener applicator relative to the position mechanism as a result of contact between the applicator and the workpiece.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mounting for positioning a fastener applicator on a positioning mechanism comprising: a mounting mechanism for mounting the fastener applicator on the positioning mechanism in a manner such that the applicator is able to move to a limited extent with at least one degree of freedom of movement relative to the positioning mechanism for accommodating at least one of positional and orientational discrepancies between the applicator and a workpiece to which a fastener is to be applied; and at least one fluid actuator means for applying a load in respect of said at least one degree of freedom of movement to a portion of the mounting mechanism which is movable with the applicator in a direction of said degree of freedom of movement and for at least partly balancing, wit the load, the gravitational effects of a mass of the applicator in the direction of said degree of freedom of movement, the applied load being such that a net force and turning moment in the sense of said degree of freedom of movement is in substantial equilibrium so that the applicator is movable by a minimal force in the direction of said degree of freedom of movement, said at least one fluid actuator means thereby enabling final correction of the applicator position and orientation prior to fastener application by movement of the applicator relative to the positioning mechanism in the direction of the at least one degree of freedom of movement as a result of contact between the applicator and the workpiece. 2. A mounting as claimed in claim 1, further comprising means for applying the load to the mounting mechanism by said at least one fluid actuator means after fastener application, to move said fastener applicator clear of the workpiece. 3. A mounting as claimed in claim 1, including locking means for locking said at least one fluid actuator means and thus the mounting mechanism in relation to the positioning mechanism, during robotic pre-positioning, and releasing said at least one fluid actuator means and mounting mechanism after robotic pre-positioning and prior to final correction. 4. A mounting for positioning a fastener applicator on a positioning mechanism comprising: a mounting mechanism for mounting the fastener applicator on the positioning mechanism in a manner such that the applicator is able to move to a limited extent with at least one degree of freedom of movement relative to the positioning mechanism for accommodating at least one of positional and orientational discrepancies been the applicator and a workpiece to which a fastener is to be applied; and at least one fluid actor means for applying a load in respect of said at least one degree of freedom of movement to a portion of the mounting mechanism which is movable with the applicator in a direction of said degree of freedom of movement and for at least partly balancing, with the load, the gravitational effects of a mass of the applicator in the direction of said degree of freedom of movement, the applied load being such that a predetermined directional bias in the direction of said degree of freedom of movement is provided, so that the applicator is movable by a minimal force in the direction of said degree of freedom of movement, said at least one fluid actuator means thereby enabling final correction of the applicator positioning and orientation prior to fastener application by movement of the applicator relative to the positioning mechanism in the direction of the at least one degree of freedom of movement as a result of contact between the applicator and the workpiece. 5. A mounting as claimed in claim 4, further comprising means for applying the load to the mounting mechanism by said at least one fluid actuator means after fastener application, to move said fastener applicator clear of the workpiece. 6. A mounting as claimed in claim 4, including locking means for locking said at least one fluid actuator means and thus the mounting mechanism in relation to the positioning mechanism, during robotic pre-positioning, and releasing said at least one fluid actuator means and mounting mechanism after robotic pre-positioning and prior to final correction.
