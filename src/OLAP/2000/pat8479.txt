A robotic gripper, the grippers of which engage as positive-fit elements on a magazine wall. The gripper is used to grip magazines for lead frames. This prevents any pressure stress on the magazines. The positive-fit elements furthermore, because of their shape, prevent the lead frames from slipping out of the magazine under high accelerations.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for handling horizontally disposed plate-shaped items, comprising: a magazine for holding plate shaped items, the magazine comprising rectangular, vertically extending walls having inner sides along which longitudinally extend horizontally disposed facing grooves that form guides for receipt of the plate shaped items, and wherein the walls terminate at their sides in side edges such that the magazine is open at each end; and two grippers for grasping, in each case, the edges of the magazine such that the guides are overlapped to a degree sufficient to prevent items from inadvertently slipping out of the magazine, wherein the grippers have bolt-like positive-fit elements for cooperation with groove-like depressions on the edges of the magazine to facilitate the establishment of a grip without requiring an inwardly directed force. 2. The system as recited in claim 1, further comprising means for synchronizing the gripping motion of the grippers with each other.
