Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 8, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40 41, 42, 43, 44, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 29, 39 or 45 and which inhibits expression of human X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 8, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43 or 44. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis is inhibited.
