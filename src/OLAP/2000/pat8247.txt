A robotic safety clutch that provides a wireless connection between the safety clutch and an robotic/automatic arm controller. The safety clutch includes a sensor for sensing a crash event and a radio frequency transmitter for transmitting a crash signal in response to the sensed crash event to a radio frequency receiver. The radio frequency receiver is connected to the robotic/automatic arm controller. Upon receiving the crash signal from the transmitter, the receiver sends a crash signal to the controller and in response to the crash signal, the controller shuts down all robotic/automatic functions.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A wireless robotic collision sensor for a robotic/automatic motion device comprising: a crash sensor for sensing a crash event; a radio frequency transmitter for transmitting a crash signal in response to the sensed crash event; said sensor and transmitter being mounted on a welding torch, and a radio frequency receiver for receiving said crash signal transmitted by said transmitter; said receiver electrically connected to a controller of said robotic/automatic motion device; said transmitter including a housing enclosing a transmitter circuit; said transmitter circuit comprising: a low power switch activated when the power supply of the transmitter falls below a predetermined level and upon activation of the low power switch a low power signal is produced to be transmitted to the receiver; a test receiver switch to allow the operator to test whether the receiver and transmitter are properly communicating and upon activation of the test receiver switch a test signal is produced to be transmitted to the receiver; a wire feed jog switch to activate a wire feeder to supply wire through the welding torch and upon activation of the wire feed jog switch a wire feed signal is produced to be transmitted to the receiver; an encoder for converting multiple inputs into a single output, said low power switch, test receiver switch, wire feed switch and the crash sensor are applied to the inputs of the encoder; a modulator for modulating the output signal of the encoder; and a transmitter antenna for transmitting the modulated output signal of the encoder to the receiver; whereby said controller disables said robotic/automatic motion device upon receipt of the crash signal by said receiver. 2. A collision sensor as in claim 1 wherein the receiver includes a housing enclosing a receiver circuit, said receiver circuit comprising: a receiver antenna for receiving the signal from the transmitter; a decoder for converting the transmitted signal received by the antenna into a multiple of output lines; a low power indicator that is activated when the receiver receives the low power signal from the transmitter; a test indicator that is activated when the receiver receives the test signal from the transmitter, indicating that the transmitter and receiver are properly communicating with each other; and a wire feed switch that is activated when the receiver receives the wire feed signal from the transmitter and is electrically connected to the controller which activates a wire feeder in response to receiving the wire feed signal to supply wire through the welding torch. 3. A method for disabling a robotic/automatic motion device in the event of a crash event, the method comprising the steps of: providing a sensor for sensing a crash event; mounting said sensor on a welding torch fitted on said robotic/automatic motion device; providing a radio frequency transmitter for transmitting signals in response to selected crash information; providing a radio frequency receiver for receiving said signals transmitted by said transmitter; providing a housing enclosing a transmitter circuit comprising: a low power switch activated when the power supply of the transmitter falls below a predetermined level and upon activation of the low power switch a low power signal is produced; a test receiver switch to allow the operator to test whether the receiver and transmitter are properly communicating and upon activation of the test receiver switch a test signal is produced to be transmitted to the receiver; a wire feed jog switch to activate a wire feeder to supply wire through the welding torch and upon activation of the wire feed jog switch a wire feed signal is produced to be transmitted to the receiver; an encoder for converting multiple inputs into a single output, said low power switch, test receiver switch, wire feed switch and the crash sensor are applied to the inputs of the encoder; a modulator for modulating the output signal of the encoder; and a transmitter antenna for transmitting the modulated output signal of the encoder to the receiver; and combining said receiver with a controller of said robotic/automatic motion device; whereby said controller disables said robotic/automatic motion device upon receipt of signals by said receiver.
