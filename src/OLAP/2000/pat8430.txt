The present invention provides a method and an apparatus for scanning an object to obtain data on the object and determine the configuration of the object. A gantry (12) allows movement along a first direction (A-A'). A set of platforms (14A, 14B) allows movement along a second direction (B-B'). A set of cameras (16A and 16B) provide additional degrees of freedom and also provide for scanning the object (10) to obtain information about the object. The freedom of movement provided by the gantry, the platforms, and the cameras allows the object to be completely scanned. In addition, once the initial scanning process has been completely, areas which require additional scanning, such as compartments (10D), are identified. The cameras are then positioned, such as directly above or inside a compartment, and then the compartment is scanned to obtain information about the compartment that could not be obtained from the initial scanning procedure. The data obtained from the initial scan and any subsequent scans is processed to determine the configuration of the object. The information concerning the configuration is then used to perform a welding, cutting or other operation on the object.
Claims What is claimed is: 1.
