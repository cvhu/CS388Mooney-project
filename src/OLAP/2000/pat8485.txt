Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of MEKK5. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding MEKK5. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of MEKK5 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of MEKK5 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a start codon, nucleobases 4526-4849 of the 3'-untranslated region, a coding region, a stop codon, nucleobases 3-189 of the 5'-untranslated region of human MEKK5 (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human MEKK5. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NOS: 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 47, 11, 30 or 37 which inhibits the expression of human MEKK5. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. The antisense compound of claim 3 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 12. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 13. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 14. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 15. The antisense compound of claim 14 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 16. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 17. The antisense compound of claim 16 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 18. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 19. A method of inhibiting the expression of human MEKK5 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human MEKK5 is inhibited. 20. A method of inhibiting the expression of human MEKK5 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 3 so that expression of human MEKK5 is inhibited.
