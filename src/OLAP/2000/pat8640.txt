Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Ship-2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Ship-2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Ship-2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Ship-2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human Ship-2, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human Ship-2. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 11, 13, 14, 20, 26, 31, 40, 41, 47, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 39, 43, 45 or 46. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 11, 13, 14, 26, 31, 40 or 41. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 13. The composition of claim 12 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 14. The composition of claim 12 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 15. A method of inhibiting the expression of Ship-2 in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of Ship-2 is inhibited.
