A data input glove for use with a computer system, virtual reality system or the like, with numerous electrodes place on the glove and interconnected with electronic controls enabling sensing of contact between any combination of the electrodes, with electrodes made of flexible electrically conductive fabric, silk-screened electrically conductive paint or the like.
Claims We claim: 1. A data input glove system comprising: a glove having a plurality flexible fabric electrode disposed thereon; an electronic control means for supplying electrical signals to any one of the flexible fabric electrodes and for detecting electrical signals from the remaining flexible fabric electrodes, and thereafter supplying electrical signal to any other of the flexible fabric electrodes and detecting electrical signals from the remaining flexible fabric electrodes, and continuing to supplying electrical signals to the plurality of electrodes in turn while detecting electrical signals from all other electrodes.
