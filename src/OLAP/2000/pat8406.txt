The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 61, 62, 63, 65, 77, 81, 83, 87, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 34, 39, 44, 46, 47, 49, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 64, 66, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 82, 84, 85 or 86 which inhibits the expression of human G-alpha-S1. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. The antisense compound of claim 3 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 12. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 13. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 14. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 15. The antisense compound of claim 14 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 16. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 17. The antisense compound of claim 16 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 18.
