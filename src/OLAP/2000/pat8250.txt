Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a 5' untranslated region, a start codon, a coding region, and a stop codon of human pI3 kinase p55 gamma, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human pI3 kinase p55 gamma (SEQ ID NO: 3). 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4.

The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'--O--methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and an acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human PI3 kinase p55 gamma in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human PI3 kinase p55 gamma is inhibited. 14. An antisense compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 or 89 which inhibits the expression of human pI3 kinase p55 gamma. 15. The antisense compound of claim 14 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 16.

The antisense compound of claim 16 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'--O--methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 18. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 19. The antisense compound of claim 18 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 20. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 21. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 22. The antisense compound of claim 21 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 23. A method of inhibiting the expression of human PI3 kinase p55 gamma in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 14 so that expression of human PI3 kinase p55 gamma is inhibited.
