Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of PEPCK-mitochondrial. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding PEPCK-mitochondrial. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of PEPCK-mitochondrial expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of PEPCK-mitochondrial are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human PEPCK-mitochondrial, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human PEPCK-mitochondrial. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 25, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40, 42, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26, 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, 41, 44, 46 or 47. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 27, 31, 33, 34, 39, 40 or 42. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'--O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 13. The composition of claim 12 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 14. The composition of claim 12 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 15. A method of inhibiting the expression of PEPCK-mitochondrial in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of PEPCK-mitochondrial is inhibited.
