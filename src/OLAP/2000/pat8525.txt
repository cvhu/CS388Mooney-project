Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Beta catenin. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Beta catenin. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Beta catenin expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Beta catenin are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a 3'-untranslated region, a start codon, a coding region from nucleobases 276-2450, a stop codon or a 5'-untranslated region of human Beta catenin, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human Beta catenin. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 10, 12, 13, 17, 25, 35, 37 or 45 which inhibits the expression of human Beta catenin. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Beta catenin in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Beta catenin is inhibited. 12. The antisense compound of claim 3 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 14. The antisense compound of claim 13 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 15. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 16. The antisense compound of claim 15 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 17. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 18. The antisense compound of claim 17 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 19. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 20. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Beta catenin in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 3 so that expression of human Beta catenin is inhibited.
