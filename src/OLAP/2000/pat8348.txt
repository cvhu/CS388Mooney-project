A method and apparatus for inserting a part, such as a spool valve, into a bore of a body, such as a transmission valve body. The apparatus includes a gripper tool that holds the part by use of a light vacuum pressure. The gripper tool is attached to a robotic arm that aligns the part with the bore. Once the part is aligned with the bore, a vacuum pressure is created within the bore that is effective to pull the part from the gripper tool and into the bore.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated mechanism for inserting a part into a bore of a body comprising: a gripper for applying a holding force to the part; motion means for moving the part and substantially aligning it immediately outside of and substantially concentric with the bore; apparatus for applying vacuum suction in the bore in the direction of insertion of the part; and means for alternately removing and applying the holding force on the part by the gripper when the part is aligned with the bore. 2. A mechanism according to claim 1 wherein the gripper comprises a pilot gripper tool provided with a vacuum bore to hold the part by suction. 3. A mechanism according to claim 1 wherein the gripper is a V-block gripper tool provided with a vacuum bore to hold the part by suction. 4. A mechanism according to claim 1 further comprising means for twisting the part back-and-forth. 5. A mechanism according to claim 1 further including means for moving the part in a spiral of increasing diameter. 6. A mechanism according to claim 1 wherein the vacuum force is applied in the bore through a vacuum plate, a vacuum manifold and a vacuum suction mechanism. 7. A mechanism according to claim 1 further including a mechanism for assembling a spring and spring cap into the bore.
