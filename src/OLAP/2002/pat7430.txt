A computer based, iterative process for generating chemical entities with defined physical, chemical and/or bioactive properties. During each iteration of the process, (1) a directed diversity chemical library is robotically generated in accordance with robotic synthesis instructions; (2) the compounds in the directed diversity chemical library are analyzed to identify compounds with the desired properties; (3) structure-property data are used to select compounds to be synthesized in the next iteration; and (4) new robotic synthesis instructions are automatically generated to control the synthesis of the directed diversity chemical library for the next iteration.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for at least partially automatically generating compounds having at least a prescribed set of properties, comprising the steps of: (1) robotically synthesizing a directed diversity chemical library comprising a plurality of chemical compounds; (2) analyzing said chemical compounds to obtain structure-activity data pertaining thereto; (3) comparing said structure-activity data of said chemical compounds against said prescribed set of properties to identify any of said chemical compounds conforming to said prescribed set of properties; (4) classifying said identified chemical compounds as lead compounds; (5) analyzing said structure-activity data of said lead compounds and historical structure-activity data pertaining to compounds synthesized and analyzed in the past to derive structure-activity models having predictive and discriminating capabilities; (6) identifying, in accordance with said structure-activity models, reagents that, when combined, will produce a first set of compounds predicted to exhibit activity/properties more closely matching said prescribed set of properties; (7) generating robotic synthesis instructions that, when performed, enable robotic synthesis of said first set of compounds; and (8) robotically synthesizing a new directed diversity chemical library comprising a plurality of chemical compounds using said generated synthesis instructions and repeating steps (2) through (7). 2. The method of claim 1, wherein step (6) comprises the step of: identifying reagents that, when combined, will produce a second set of compounds predicted to have a superior ability to validate said structure-activity models, wherein said first and second sets of compounds are not mutually exclusive; wherein step (7) comprises the step of generating synthesis instructions that, when performed, enable synthesis of said second set of compounds. 3.
