A method and apparatus for producing schedules for a wafer in a multichamber semiconductor wafer processing tool comprising the steps of providing a trace defining a series of chambers that are visited by a wafer as the wafer is processed by the tool; initializing a sequence generator with a value of a variable defining initial wafer positioning within the tool; generating all successor variables for the initial variable value to produce a series of values of the variable that represent a partial schedule; backtracking through the series of variables to produce further partial schedules; and stopping the backtracking when all possible variable combinations are produced that represent all possible valid schedules for the trace. All the possible schedules are analyzed to determine a schedule that produces the highest throughput of all the schedules.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A schedule data structure, stored in a computer readable storage medium, of a schedule for processing a wafer in a multichamber semiconductor wafer processing tool comprising: a plurality of n-tuples, where n is a total number of possible wafer positions, and the plurality of n-tuples contains only one duplicate n-tuple. 2. The schedule data structure of claim 1 wherein n is a total number of possible wafer positions plus a position of transport robot position. 3. The schedule data structure of claim 1 wherein the n-tuple has a form (x.sub.1,x.sub.2,x.sub.3, . . . ,x.sub.n), where x defines the contents of a particular chamber at a particular point in a schedule and x has a value 0 when a wafer is not positioned in the chamber and a value of 1 when a wafer is positioned in the chamber.
