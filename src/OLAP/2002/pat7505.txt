Silylmethanethiols have been found to be useful promoters in the acid catalyzed condensation reaction between phenol and acetone to afford bisphenol A. Silylmethanethiols provide improvements in both the rate and selectivity of bisphenol A formation relative to known thiol promoters such as 3-mercaptopropionic acid or hexanethiol.
