An automated system and method for chromosome microdissection involves securing a micro-tool, verifying a micro-tip position and configuration and execution of a predetermined cut pattern of a location identified by an equipment operator. The present method involves preparation of sample material on a slide placed upon a stage of an inverted optical microscope, location of the target sample for dissection, micro-tool calibration and microdissection itself. Micro-tool calibration involves the use of cameras, preferably mounted at an angle from each other, for seeing the micro-tool point, such cameras associated with vision software programs capable of locating the tool point tip at three-dimensional space. Microdissection is performed on an isolated section of chromosome placed within the appropriate three-dimensional stage. The present system and method provides reliability and ease of operation thus making microdissection widely available to laboratories.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for micromanipulating a biologic material, comprising: a) positioning a biologic material on a microscope slide; b) positioning the biologic material on said slide at a desired point beneath a microscope objective, said microscope having a sub-stage capable of rotation about an optical path of said microscope; c) rotating said sub-stage to a desired orientation; d) initiating movement of an automatic micro-manipulation device to manipulate desired portions of said biologic material; e) using said micromanipulation device, moving said desired portions of said biologic material to a receptacle; and f) depositing said desired portions of said biologic material into said receptacle; g) calibrating said automatic micromanipulation device by determining the precise position of a first micro-tool tip and recording information relating to the spatial position of said first micro-tool tip as said micro-tool tip is moved to a desired point beneath a microscope objective, wherein said step of determining comprises positioning said micro-tool tip in the field of view of two CCD cameras and recording a zero position of said micro-tool tip. 2. A method for micromanipulating a biologic material, comprising: a) positioning a biologic material on a microscope slide; b) positioning the biologic material on said slide at a desired point beneath a microscope objective, said microscope having a sub-stage capable of rotation about an optical path of said microscope; c) rotating said sub-stage to a desired orientation; d) initiating movement of an automatic micro-manipulation device to manipulate desired portions of said biologic material; e) using said micromanipulation device, moving said desired portions of said biologic material to a receptacle; and f) depositing said desired portions of said biologic material into said receptacle; g) calibrating said automatic micromanipulation device by determining the precise position of a first micro-tool tip and recording information relating to the spatial position of said first micro-tool tip as said micro-tool tip is moved to a desired point beneath a microscope objective, further comprising using said information to coordinate the movement of a second micro-tool to a desired point beneath said microscope objective.
