Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human Integrin beta 4 binding protein, wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid and inhibits the expression of human Integrin beta 4 binding protein. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87 or 88. 4. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Integrin beta 4 binding protein in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Integrin beta 4 binding protein is inhibited.
