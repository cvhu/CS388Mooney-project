Motion of a substrate-transporting robot arm is controlled in order to compensate for inaccuracies and deflections encountered during operation. The compensation is effected by synchronizing elevational and planar motions of the robot arm such that the trajectory of the substrate is made coincident with the object axis of the substrate. The substrate may be a semiconductor wafer, an LCD panel or an end effector of the robot arm. The synchronized motion is achieved using a controller issuing control signals to arm actuating means based on synchronization algorithms developed during analytical or experimental robot learning sessions.
