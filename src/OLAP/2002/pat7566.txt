Control of a robotic mechanism comprising both active and passive joints is accomplished, where the motion of one or more of the passive joints is constrained by one or more constraints imposed on the mechanism by the environment, the mechanical construction of the mechanism, or the nature of the task such as a surgical robot holding a surgical instrument inserted into a patient through a natural or man-made orifice. The control incrementally moves the mechanism in a series of successive movements from its actual position to its desired or target position. The effect of moving each individual joint of the mechanism is characterized by Cartesian displacement of the target and a Jacobian is constructed mapping between infinitesimal joint displacements of the target to be extended to include both passive and active joints. Thus, hybrid robots containing both active and passive joints can be effectively controlled.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for controlling a robot, constrained by an opening, comprising both active and passive joints, comprising step of: quantifying environmental constraints on said active joints and said passive joints defined by said opening; quantifying current positions of said active joints and said passive joints; quantifying an actual position of a target element using said current positions of said active joints and said passive joints; quantifying a desired position for said target element; calculating a Jacobian using said quantified environmental constraints relating velocities in active joint space and passive joint space to velocities in Cartesian space for an incremental movement between said actual position and said desired position; and moving said active joints according to said Jacobian such that said opening is undisturbed.
