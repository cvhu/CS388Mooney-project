A container for use in a processing chamber to lessen the amount of contaminant particles found within the chamber after processing. The container fits closely within the chamber and includes ports for a gas conduit and a vacuum conduit. The container may be locked to the chamber through a locking mechanism and a recess in the container. The container may be guided into the chamber with a plurality of chamfers. The container may be used in inductively coupled plasma chambers, electron cyclotron resonance chambers, and chambers capable of receiving microwaves.
Claims What is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is: 1. A container for use with a work piece plasma processing chamber, said container comprising: a housing defining an enclosed space within which a work piece can be mounted and processed, said housing including a door for access to said enclosed space and a releasable locking mechanism for releasably locking said container within processing chamber, said housing having a configuration which permits said housing to be inserted into and removed from a work piece processing chamber; and at least a pair of ports provided in said housing, one said port adapted to communicate fluids into the container used in processing a work piece and at least one other said port adapted to communicate fluids out of the container. 2. The container of claim 1, further comprising: a gas conduit positioned through and sealed to one said port; and a vacuum conduit in fluid communication with said at least one other said port. 3. The container of claim 1, wherein said locking mechanism comprises a recess. 4. The container of claim 1, wherein the container is made of materials allowing the container to have an effective life longer than a single plasma processing. 5. The container of claim 1, wherein the container is made of materials allowing the container to have an effective life at least as long as the plasma processing.
