The compound of claim 1 which is on antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of HPK/GCK-like kinase in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of HPK/GCK-like kinase of SEQ ID NO: 3 is inhibited. 14. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, or 49 which inhibits the expression of HPK/GCK-like kinase of SEQ ID NO: 3. 15. The compound of claim 14 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 16. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 17. The compound of claim 16 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 18. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 19. The compound of claim 18 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 20. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 21. The compound of claim 20 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 22. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 23. A composition comprising the compound of claim 14 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 24. The composition of claim 23 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 25. The composition of claim 23 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 26. A method of inhibiting the expression of HPK/GCK-like kinase of SEQ ID NO: 3 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 14 so that expression of HPK/GCK-like kinase is inhibited.
