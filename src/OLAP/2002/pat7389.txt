The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least a 16-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 14, 15, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 53, 54, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 72, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90 or 91 which inhibits the expression of human helicase-moi. 4. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the compound is antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of human helicase-moi in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of human helicase-moi is inhibited. 15. The compound of claim 3 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 16. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 17. The compound of claim 16 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 18. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 19. The compound of claim 18 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 20. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 21. The compound of claim 20 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 22. The compound of claim 15 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 23. A composition comprising the compound of claim 3 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 24. The composition of claim 23 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 25. The composition of claim 23 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 26. A method of inhibiting the expression of human helicase-moi in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 3 so that expression of human helicase-moi is inhibited.
