To train the sequential kinematic behavior of an automated telekinegenesis robot system, a virtual reality simulator is driven with kinematic parameter data derived from a teleoperational device, which models the sequential behavior to be exhibited by the target robot. Sensor outputs of the teleoperational device are processed by a geometry conversion algorithm, to generate data representative of the spatial kinematics of the robot's desired travel path. A kinematic machine simulator program within a robotic control simulation workstation simulates a virtual machine based upon the actual parameters of the robot. The virtual reality simulation program is interactive, allowing the workstation operator to selectively interrupt the operation of the machine, modify its control parameters, and then rerun the program, until the desired behavior of the target machine is achieved. When the target machine's simulated kinematic behavior produced by the virtual reality simulation workstation exhibits the desired dynamic spatial geometry profile, the customized spatial parameter data stored in the workstation is processed by the virtual reality simulation program, to produce a sequence of kinematic control instructions that are downloaded into the micro controller of the target machine. When executed, the kinematic control instructions cause the robot to exhibit its intended on-line sequential kinematic behavior.
