A multi-paned fenestration unit in which the glass panes are manufactured directly into the support structure without first manufacturing an insulated glass unit. The support structure is designed to provide the structural support for the glass panes without a separate spacer.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of manufacturing a fenestration unit, the fenestration unit including a first glass pane and a second glass pane each comprising an inside surface, an outside surface and an edge; each of the inside surfaces having a border portion and an inner portion and each of the outside surfaces having a border portion and an inner portion, the method comprising: constructing a first sash section having a first receiving surface, the first receiving surface including a raised portion at an inner edge; constructing a second sash section having a second receiving surface and a third receiving surface; constructing a third sash section having a fourth receiving surface, the fourth receiving portion including a raised portion at an inner edge; depositing a first secondary sealant on at least one of the group of the first receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane; placing the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane on the first receiving surface after depositing the first secondary sealant; depositing a first primary sealant on at least one of the group of the second receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the first glass pane; placing the second receiving surface on the border portion of the inner surface of the first glass pane after depositing the first primary sealant; depositing a second primary sealant on at least one of the group of the third receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane; placing the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane on the third receiving surface after depositing the second primary sealant; depositing a second secondary sealant on at least one of the group of the fourth receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane; placing the fourth receiving surface on the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane after depositing the second secondary sealant. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising attaching a means for reducing outgassing to the second sash section in contact with the second and third receiving surfaces. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein the first and second primary sealants are deposited on the means for reducing outgassing. 4. A fenestration unit comprising: a first glass pane having an inside surface and an outside surface, the inside surface having a border portion and an inner portion and the outside surface having a border portion and an inner portion; a second glass pane having an inside surface and an outside surface, the outside surface having a border portion and an inner portion, and the inside surface having a border portion and an inner portion, and the inside surface of the first glass pane facing the inside surface of the second glass pane; a support structure comprising: a) a first sash section having a first receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane, the first receiving surface including a raised portion at an inner edge; b) a second sash section having a second receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the inside surface of the first glass pane second glass pane and a third receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane; c) a third sash section having a fourth receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane, the fourth receiving surface including a raised portion at an inner edge; and d) a vapor barrier placed in contact with the second and third receiving surfaces; a first primary sealant disposed between the vapor barrier on the second receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the first glass pane; a second primary sealant disposed between the vapor barrier on the third receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane; a first secondary sealant disposed between and in contact with the first receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane; and a second secondary sealant disposed between and in contact with the fourth receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane. 5. A method of manufacturing a fenestration unit, the fenestration unit including a first glass pane and a second glass pane each comprising an inside surface, an outside surface and an edge; each of the inside surfaces having a border portion and an inner portion and each of the outside surfaces having a border portion and an inner portion, the method comprising: constructing a first sash section having a first receiving surface; constructing a second sash section having a second receiving surface and a third receiving surface, each of the second and third receiving surfaces including raised portions at an inner edge; constructing a third sash section having a fourth receiving surface; depositing a first secondary sealant on at least one of the group of the first receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane; placing the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane on the first receiving surface after depositing the first secondary sealant; depositing a first primary sealant on at least one of the group of the second receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the first glass pane; placing the second receiving surface on the border portion of the inner surface of the first glass pane after depositing the first primary sealant; depositing a second primary sealant on at least one of the group of the third receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane; placing the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane on the third receiving surface after depositing the second primary sealant; depositing a second secondary sealant on at least one of the group of the fourth receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane; placing the fourth receiving surface on the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane after depositing the second secondary sealant. 6. A fenestration unit comprising: a first glass pane having an inside surface and an outside surface, the inside surface having a border portion and an inner portion and the outside surface having a border portion and an inner portion; a second glass pane having an inside surface and an outside surface, the outside surface having a border portion and an inner portion, and the inside surface having a border portion and an inner portion, and the inside surface of the first glass pane facing the inside surface of the second glass pane; a support structure comprising: a) a first sash section having a first receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane; b) a second sash section having a second receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the inside surface of the first glass pane second glass pane and a third receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane, each of the second and third receiving surfaces including raised portions at an inner edge; c) a third sash section having a fourth receiving surface for receiving the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane; and d) a vapor barrier placed in contact with the second and third receiving surfaces; a first primary sealant disposed between the vapor barrier on the second receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the first glass pane; a second primary sealant disposed between the vapor barrier on the third receiving surface and the border portion of the inside surface of the second glass pane; a first secondary sealant disposed between and in contact with the first receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the first glass pane; and a second secondary sealant disposed between and in contact with the fourth receiving surface and the border portion of the outside surface of the second glass pane.
