Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent). The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent). Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent) expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent) are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 82, 84, 87, 88 or 89 which inhibits the expression of Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent). 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3, wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a Phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5, wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7, wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10, further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10, wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent) in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 3 so that expression of human Phospholipase A2, group VI (Ca2+-independent) is inhibited.
