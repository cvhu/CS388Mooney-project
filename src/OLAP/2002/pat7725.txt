A universal machine translator of arbitrary languages enables the semantic, or meaningful, translation of arbitrary languages with zero loss of meaning of the source language in the target language translation, which loss is typical in prior art human and machine translations. The universal machine translator embodies universal transformations itself and comprises the means for identifying high-level grammatical constructions of a source language word stream, constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the source language high-level word stream, decomposing source and target languages into universal moments of meaning, or epistemic instances, translating the epistemic moments of source and target languages with substantially no loss in meaning, constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the target language high-level word stream, optionally adjusting the target language syntax to comply with a preferred target language grammar, and generating the translated target language word stream. The universal machine translator also comprises the means to embody arbitrary sensory/motor receptions and transmissions of arbitrary word streams, which allows universally translated communications to occur among human beings and machines.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for the universal machine translation of arbitrary languages, comprising the steps of: identifing high-level grammatical constructions of an arbitrary source language word stream; constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the high-level grammatical construction arbitrary source language word stream based only on epistemic instances of the source language; decomposing the arbitrary source language into only its epistemic instances and an arbitrary target language into only its epistemic instances, wherein the source language epistemic instances semantically correspond to the target language epistemic instances; translating the epistemic instances of the source language word stream into semantically equivalent epistemic instances of the target language with substantially no loss in meaning; constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of a target language high-level word stream using only the epistemic instances of the target language; and generating a translated target language word stream; wherein each of the epistemic instances comprises a pair of objects of transformation in the source language's or the target language's word stream, and a transformer of the pair of objects. 2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of adjusting a target language syntax to comply with a preferred target language grammar. 3.
