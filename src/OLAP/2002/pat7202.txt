High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods and systems are disclosed that combine sequential, serial injection of a plurality of samples into mobile-phases supplied in parallel to two or more chromatographic columns, such that staggered, parallel separation of the plurality of samples is effected. Because injection of samples is relatively fast as compared to separation, substantial efficiencies are gained with respect to overall sample throughput. The disclosed HPLC methods and systems are preferably applied in connection with combinatorial chemistry, combinatorial material science and more particularly, combinatorial synthesis and screening of polymeric materials.
Claims I claim: 1. A liquid chromatography system useful for rapid separation or characterization of a plurality of samples, the system comprising two or more chromatographic columns, two or more supply conduits providing continuous parallel fluid communication between a liquid mobile-phase source and the two or more chromatographic columns, respectively, the fluid communication being provided by each of the two or more supply conduits through one or more flow restrictors, an injection system, comprising an injector and a multi-port switching valve, for serially and distributively injecting a plurality of samples into a liquid mobile phase supplied in parallel to the two or more chromatographic columns, the injector having a sample-loading port for serially receiving a plurality of samples and having a sample-discharge port for discharging the plurality of samples under pressure to the switching valve, the switching valve having an inlet port and two or more selectable outlet ports, the inlet port being in fluid communication with the sample-discharge port of the injector and being in selectable fluid communication with the two or more selectable outlet ports, the two or more selectable outlet ports being in fluid communication with the two or more chromatographic columns, respectively, such that the plurality of samples can be serially and distributively injected into the mobile phase of the two or more chromatographic columns. 2. The liquid chromatography system of claim 1 further comprising a control system for controlling which of the two or more selectable outlet ports of the switching valve is in fluid communication with the inlet port of the switching valve. 3. The liquid chromatography system of claim 1 wherein the two or more chromatographic columns are four or more chromatographic columns, the two or more mobile phase supply conduits are four or more mobile phase supply conduits, the switching valve has four or more selectable outlet ports, the inlet port is in selectable fluid communication with the four or more selectable outlet ports, and the four or more selectable outlet ports are in fluid communication with the four or more chromatographic columns, respectively, such that the plurality of samples can be serially and distributively injected into the mobile phase of the four or more chromatographic columns. 4. The liquid chromatography system of claim 1 wherein the injector is a multi-loop injection valve. 5. The liquid chromatography system of claim 1 further comprising one or more detectors in fluid communication with the two or more chromatographic columns. 6. A system for evaluating interactions between a plurality of liquid samples and one or more solid or supported materials, the system comprising two or more columns comprising solid or supported materials, two or more supply conduits providing continuous parallel fluid communication between a liquid mobile-phase source and the two or more columns, respectively, the fluid communication being provided by each of the two or more supply conduits through one or more flow restrictors, and an injection system, comprising an injector and a multi-port switching valve, for serially and distributively injecting a plurality of liquid samples into a liquid mobile phase supplied to the two or more columns, the injector having a sample-loading port for serially receiving the plurality of samples and having a sample-discharge port for discharging the plurality of samples under pressure to the switching valve, the switching valve having an inlet port and two or more selectable outlet ports, the inlet port being in fluid communication with the sample-discharge port of the injector and being in selectable fluid communication with the two or more selectable outlet ports, the two or more selectable outlet ports being in fluid communication with the two or more columns, respectively, such that the plurality of samples can be serially and distributively injected into the mobile phase of the two or more columns.
