Vibration data is transmitted from a remote site to a control facility using wireless data transmission. In one embodiment, the vibration signal is conditioned and digitized, and then sent via a page transmitter to the control facility.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A vibration monitoring system comprising: a vibration transducer connected to vibrating machinery for collecting raw vibration measurements; signal conditioning and digitizing circuitry connected to said vibration transducer and configured to process said raw vibration measurements to produce digital data indicative of the condition of said vibrating machinery; a memory receivably connected to said digital conditioning and digitizing circuitry and storing at least a portion of said digital data; a first page unit connected to said memory, wherein said first page unit is configured to transmit at least a portion of said digital data using page network frequencies and signaling protocols to a mobile page unit, and wherein said first page unit and said mobile page unit are configured to transmit and receive page messages. 2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a battery management circuit that only powers those portions of said signal conditioning and digitizing circuitry necessary to produce said portion of said digital data for transmission to said mobile page unit. 3. A method of monitoring the condition of a machine comprising: connecting a vibration transducer to said machine for collecting raw vibration measurements; connecting signal conditioning and digitizing circuitry to said vibration transducer; configuring said circuitry to process said raw vibration measurements to produce an overall average vibration amplitude value encoded as an alphanumeric string indicative of the condition of said machine; connecting a memory to said circuitry and storing at least a portion of said digital data; sending a request page from a mobile page unit to said machine, wherein said mobile page unit is configured to transmit and receive page messages, and wherein said request page consists essentially of an alphanumeric string which contains a request for data indicative of said machine's condition; and in response thereto, sending a response page to said mobile page unit via a page unit local to said machine, wherein said response page consists essentially of said alphanumeric string, and wherein said data is based at least in part on a processing of a plurality of vibration measurements collected from said machine, and wherein said page unit local to said machine is configured to transmit and receive page messages.
