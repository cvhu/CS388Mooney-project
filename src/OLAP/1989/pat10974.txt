Apparatus for locating and manipulating agricultural products such as fruits and vegetables that emit or reflect distinctive radiation in a predetermined non-visible frequency range comprises a detection means for detecting and producing digitized images of the products based upon the non-visible radiation in the predetermined frequency range received from a given viewing area. A product locator mechanism receives the digitized images as input, compares the characteristics of the digitized input with a predetermined digitized definition of products to be selected, and generates an output signal usable for directing an output device relative to the produces. The product locator compares discrete peripheral coordinate points on the infrared and visual images with points on a mathematical curve conforming with the product outline as one means to indicate the presence of a product. A separate central processing unit controls a motion control device for picking the fruits or vegetables located.
