A servo control operates in a control loop for a robot control system and performs control support tasks and calculation tasks for the control loop for all of the robot joint motors. The servo includes first and second microprocessors. The first microprocessor performs calculation tasks including the computation of output control commands from stored algorithms for the one control loop for each joint motor. The second microprocessor supervises the operation of the servo control and performs servo control support tasks in the one control loop for each joint motor including the routing of control command, status and feedback data to and from the first microprocessor. A communication interface couples the first and second microprocessors so as to enable the servo control to operate the one control loop for each joint motor and control the controlled variable for the one control loop. The communication interface includes a first memory bank and a second memory bank. The first microprocessor is coupled to one of the banks to write command and feedback data thereto and to read calculated control data therefrom. The second microprocessor is coupled to the other of the banks to read command and feedback data therefrom and to write calculated control data thereto. The microprocessors and the memory banks are cross-switched at the control sampling rate so that the first microprocessor can supply new control calculations for control loop operation based on new control commands and feedback data in each control cycle.
