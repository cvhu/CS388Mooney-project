A method of generating a spatial representation of a 3-D solid object, which includes component shapes, which can be defined by transforming constructive solid geometry primitives includes the steps of, setting up a structure, to define the object in terms of the primitives and transforms setting up a definition of a 3-D box in a world space and then sub-dividing the box into sub-boxes, generating test-cells in object space by performing on the sub-boxes the inverse of each transformation to be performed on the primitives to create the object and determining which of the test-cells intersect the object. Thus, the need to transform the object primitives is avoided. A particular application of the method is the generation of 2-D images of a 3-D solid object.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of generating a spatial representation of a three-dimensional solid object in a system comprising storage and processing means, the method comprising: (a) the initial step of establishing in storage a structure for defining the object, the structure including the functional definitions of at least one primitive and at least one transform operator; and a functional definition of a three-dimensional box defining world space; (b) followed by the step of subdividing the box in world space into progressively smaller sub-boxes until sub-boxes are created whose size corresponds to at least a desired resolution and for at least one primitive in the structure, traversing the structure to identify whether any transform operators are to be applied to the primitive as defined by the structure, and, if so, generating test-cells in primitive space from the sub-boxes using the inverse of each transform operator so identified and determining whether sub-boxes having the desired resolution have corresponding test-cells which intersect the primitive, or not, whereby a spatial representation of the object may be generated without performing transform operations on the object or the component primitives thereof. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the stucture is a tree structure with the complete solid object defined at the root node of the tree structure, primitives being defined at leaf nodes and sub-objects being defined at intermediate nodes in the tree structure and wherein transform operators and combinational functions are defined at appropriate nodes for identifying how the sub-ordinate primitives and/or sub-objects are to be combined to form the object or sub-objects at the nodes of the tree. 3. A method according to claim 1 wherein the spatial representation of the three-dimensional solid object is a two-dimensional image of that object as viewed in a viewing direction from a viewing point, said image being made up of an array of image pixels and wherein the step of determining whether sub-boxes having at least the desired resolution have corresponding test-cells which intersect the primitive or not comprises the step of determining, for each row of sub-boxes having a frontal area corresponding to at least a desired resolution said rows extending in the box parallel to the viewing direction and being associated with corresponding pixels in the array forming the image, which is the sub-box, if any, nearest in that row to the viewing point whose corresponding test-cell intersects the object; and wherein the method additionally comprises the step of: storing the setting of the color and/or intensity for the pixel associated with respective rows appropriate to the result of the determination of the nearest sub-box for each row, whereby a two dimensional image of a solid object may be generated without transforming the component primitives of the object. 4. A method according to claim 3 wherein the desired resolution is the pixel resolution of the image. 5. A method according to claim 3, wherein steps (b) are recursive steps forming a plurality of stages such that, at each stage, the test-cell corresponding to the sub-box under consideration is tested for intersection and, for the case where an intersection is detected, the sub-division processes is terminated for that sub-box if its size corresponds to at least the desired resolution, otherwise the sub-box is further divided into smaller sub-boxes which are considered in turn in the next stage, whereas in the case where no intersection is detected, the sub-division process is terminated for the sub-box under consideration irrespective of its size. 6. A method according to claim 5 wherein sub-boxes nearer to the first surface of the box are considered before those further away, whereby a sub-box need not be processed where the settings for the corresponding pixels have already been determined. 7. A method according to claim 1 wherein the step of generating a test-cell comprises the step of determining a predetermined point of the transform of the box or sub-box under consideration and defining a simple 3-D volume in primitive space about said point which fully contains the transform of the box or sub-box, said volume then forming the test-cell for the box or sub-box under consideration. 8. A method according to claim 3 wherein the step of storing an indication of the color and/or intensity for the pixel associated with each row comprises the steps of transforming a vector representing a normal to the surface of a primitive within a test cell into world space and comparing the transformed surface normal vector with at least one vector representing a light source. 9. A method of generating a spatial representation of a three-dimensional solid object in a system comprising storage and processing means, the method comprising: (a) the initial step of establishing in storage a structure for defining the object, the structure including the functional definitions of a plurality of primitives and a plurality of transform operators; and a functional definition of a three-dimensional box defining world space; (b) followed by the step of subdividing the box in world space into progressively smaller sub-boxes until sub-boxes are created whose size corresponds to at least a desired resolution and for a given sub-box and a given primitive in the structure traversing the structure to that primitive to identify whether any transform operators are to be applied thereto as defined by the structure, and, if so, generating a test-cell in primitive space from the given sub-box using the inverse of each transform operator so identified and determining whether the sub-box has a corresponding test-cell which intersects the primitive, whereby a spatial representation of the object may be generated without performing transform operations on the object or the component primitives thereof. 10.
