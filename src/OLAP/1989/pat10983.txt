Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm and a variable rotational velocity pressure roller to install fixed lengths of weather stripping, stored in a loading station, into a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections, said method in combination comprising: loading said robot arm with one of said fixed lengths; transferring said fixed length from said loading station to said body opening; interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section at a first linear speed and at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed differing from said first linear speed and at a second rotational speed differing from said first rotational speed whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said sections as said fixed length is installed into said body opening. 2. A method as described in claim 1 wherein said first linear speed is greater than said second linear speed and said first rotational speed is greater than said second rotational speed. 3. A method as described in claim 1 wherein said first linear speed is greater than said second linear speed and said first rotational speed is less than said second rotational speed. 4. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm having a variable rotational velocity powered pressure roller to install oversized fixed lengths of weather stripping, stored in a loading station, to a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections cumulatively linearly shorter than said fixed length of said weather stripping, said method in combination comprising: loading said robot arm with one of said fixed lengths; transferring said fixed length from said loading station to said body opening; and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section at a first linear speed and at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed lower than said first linear speed and at a second rotational speed greater than said first rotational speed whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said sections as said fixed length is installed into said body opening and whereby the portion of said fixed length of weather stripping exceeding the linear length of said body opening is installed in a linearly compressed manner at said corner sections. 5. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm having a variable rotational velocity motor powered pressure roller, including a clutch to selectively engage or disengage said pressure roller with said motor, to install one to three percent oversized fixed lengths of weather stripping, stored in a loading station, to a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections cumulatively linearly shorter than said fixed length of said weather stripping, said method in combination comprising: loading said robot arm with one of said fixed lengths; transferring said fixed length from said loading station to said body opening; and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section at a first linear speed and said clutch disengaging said pressure roller from said motor allowing said pressure roller to free wheel at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed slower than said first linear speed and said clutch engaging said pressure roller with said motor powering said pressure roller at a second rotational speed greater than said first rotational speed whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said sections as said fixed length is installed into said body opening and whereby the portion of said fixed length of weather stripping exceeding the linear length of said opening is installed in a linearly compressed manner at said corner sections. 6. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm and a variable rotational velocity pressure roller thereon to install a fixed length of weather stripping into a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections, said method in combination comprising: interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section at a first linear speed and at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed differing from said first linear speed and at a second rotational speed differing from said first rotational speed whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said sections as said fixed length is installed by said robot into said body opening. 7. A method as described in claim 6 wherein said first linear speed is greater than said second linear speed and said first rotational speed is greater than said second rotational speed. 8. A method as described in claim 6 wherein said first linear speed is greater than said second liner speed and said first rotational speed is less than said second rotational speed. 9. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm having a variable rotational velocity powered pressure roller to install an oversized fixed length of weather stripping to a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections cumulatively linearly shorter than said fixed length of said weather stripping, said method in combination comprising: interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section at a first linear speed and at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed lower than said first linear speed and at a second rotational speed greater than said first rotational speed whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said sections as said fixed length is installed into said body opening and whereby the portion of said fixed length of weather stripping exceeding the linear length of said body opening is installed in a linearly compressed manner at said corner sections. 10. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm having a variable rotational velocity motor powered pressure roller, including a clutch to selectively engage or disengage said pressure roller with said motor, to install one to three percent oversized fixed lengths of weather stripping, stored in a loading station, to a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections cumulatively linearly shorter than said fixed length of said weather stripping, said method in combination comprising: interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section at a first linear speed and said clutch disengaging said pressure roller from said motor allowing said pressure roller to free wheel at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed slower than said first linear speed and said clutch engaging said pressure roller with said motor powering said pressure roller at a second rotational speed greater than said first rotational speed whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said sections as said fixed length is installed into said body opening and whereby the portion of said fixed length of weather stripping exceeding the liner length of said opening is installed in a linearly compressed manner at said corner sections.
