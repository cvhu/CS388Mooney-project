A receptacle is provided for receiving a plastic/adhesive used for mounting plastic body panels to a metallic subframe of an automobile in which the receptacle is formed through progressive die stamping from a cross formed blank. The receptacle is formed as truncated pyramidical shape and includes two sides with bent-over flanges for engaging the metallic subframe and two shorter sides which lock the receptacle to the subframe in snap-fit relationship after insertion into a square aperture.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an apparatus for mounting plastic body panels on metallic subframes of automobiles of the type wherein a plurality of square apertures is formed in the metallic subframe into which cups are inserted for receiving a plastic/adhesive substance to be heat cured in situ for defining a mounting surface for the body panel, the improvement wherein the cup is formed as a unitary four-sided truncated pyramidical structure having: a rectangular imperforate base portion; a pair of mounting sides extending from opposite sides of the rectangular base portion, each having a turned-over flange portion abuttingly engageable with the metallic subframe adjacent the aperture; a pair of locking sides arranged in opposed relationship extending from the remaining opposed ends of the rectangular base portion and being fabricated to normally extend in an outwardly canted direction with respect to the base portion to position the free ends thereof beyond the inner periphery of the subframe aperture, whereby insertion of the cup into the aperture operates to deflect the locking sides inwardly to permit insertion through the aperture whereupon the locking sides spring outwardly to resist removal of the receptacle from the aperture. 2. An improved mounting apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said locking sides and said mounting sides are configured to prevent contact therebetween thereby defining diverging gaps running longitudinally of the cup. 3. An improved mounting apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the cup is formed from a blank of cross-shaped configuration. 4. An improved mounting apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said cup is formed as a stamping from a cross-shaped blank having first and second opposed pairs of arms for forming said mounting and locking sides, said first and second pairs of arms being different in length. 5. An improved mounting apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said base portion is imperforate. 6. In an apparatus for mounting plastic body panels on metallic subframes of automobiles of the type wherein a plurality of square apertures is formed in the metallic subframe into which cups are inserted for receiving a plastic/adhesive substance to be heat cured in situ for defining a mounting surface for the body panel, the improvement wherein the cup is formed as a unitary four-sided truncated pyramidical structure having: a rectangular base portion; a pair of mounting sides extending from opposite sides of the rectangular base portion, each having a turned-over flange portion abuttingly engageable with the metallic subframe adjacent the aperture; a pair of locking sides arranged in opposed relationship extending from the remaining opposed ends of the rectangular base portion, having notches formed on the free ends thereof and being fabricated to normally extend in an outwardly canted direction with respect to the base portion to position the free ends thereof beyond the inner periphery of the subframe aperture, whereby insertion of the cup into the aperture operates to deflect the locking sides inwardly to permit insertion through the aperture whereupon the locking sides spring outwardly to resist removal of the cup from the aperture. 7. In an apparatus for mounting plastic body panels on metallic subframes of automobiles of the type wherein a plurality of square apertures is formed in the metallic subframe into which cups are inserted for receiving a plastic/adhesive substance to be heat cured in situ for defining a mounting surface for the body panel, the improvement wherein the cup is formed as a unitary four-sided truncated pyramidical structure having: a rectangular base portion; a pair of mounting sides extending from opposite sides of the rectangular base portion, each having a turned-over flange portion abuttingly engageable with the metallic subframe adjacent the aperture; a pair of locking sides arranged in opposed relationship extending from the remaining opposed ends of the rectangular base portion, having through apertures formed adjacent the free ends thereof and being fabricated to normally extend in an outwardly canted direction with respect to the base portion to position the free ends thereof beyond the inner periphery of the subframe aperture, whereby insertion of the cup into the aperture operates to deflect the locking sides inwardly to permit insertion through the aperture whereupon the locking sides spring outwardly to resist removal of the cup from the aperture. 8. In an apparatus for mounting plastic body panels on metallic subframes of automobiles of the type wherein a plurality of square apertures is formed in the metallic subframe into which cups are inserted for receiving a plastic/adhesive substance to be heat cured in situ for defining a mounting surface for the body panel, the improvement wherein the cup is formed as a unitary four-sided truncated pyramidical structure having: a rectangular base portion; a pair of mounting sides extending from opposite sides of the rectangular base portion, each having a turned-over flange portion abuttingly engageable with the metallic subframe adjacent the aperture; a pair of locking sides arranged in opposed relationship extending from the remaining opposed ends of the rectangular base portion, defining with the mounting sides gaps running longitudinally of the cup, having through apertures formed adjacent the free ends thereof and being fabricated to normally extend in an outwardly canted direction with respect to the base portion to position the free ends thereof beyond the inner periphery of the subframe aperture, whereby insertion of the cup into the aperture operates to deflect the locking sides inwardly to permit insertion through the aperture whereupon the locking sides spring outwardly to resist removal of the cup from the aperture.
