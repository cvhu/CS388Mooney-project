Robotic tooling is connected to a robot arm with a device including a set of support members connected together to provide for relative axial movement and rotary movement of the tooling in addition to relative lateral movement in two perpendicular directions from a home or normal position. The members are biased to a precise normal position by pressure biased telescopic plungers confined within mating and opposing recesses, and a set of linear transducers sense movement along each of the three axes and also rotary movement to provide a feedback for the robot control.
Claims The invention having thus been described, the following is claimed: 1. Apparatus adapted for connecting tooling to the moveable arm of a robot to provide for precision alignment of a part to be assembled, comprising a first support member adapted to be attached to the arm of a robot, a second support member adapted to be attached to the tooling, means connecting said first and second support members and providing for axial movement of said second support member relative to said first support member, fluid actuated means for biasing said second support member axially to a normal position relative to said first support member, said second support member including first and second support sections separated by a core member, bearing means supporting said core member and said second support section for lateral movement of said second support section in two perpendicular linear directions relative to said first support section, linear moveable biasing means for urging said second support section to a home position relative to said first support section, said linear moveable biasing means including a set of elongated opposing recesses in said first support section and in said core member and a set of elongated opposing recesses in said second support section and in said core member, each of said recesses having opposite ends, a pressure biased collapsible plunger within each set of opposing recesses and having opposite end portions engaging said opposite ends of said recesses to form precision said home position, and electrical control means for sensing movement of said second support member in said axial direction from said normal position and for sensing movement of said second support section laterally in each of said perpendicular directions from said home position relative to said first support section. 2. Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said first support member includes a first section and a second section supported for substantial rotation relative to said first section, means including a rack and pinion for biasing said second section to a normal rotational position relative to said first section, and electrical control means for sensing movement of said rack and corresponding rotation of said second section of said first support member relative to said first section. 3. Apparatus as defined in claim 2 and including power actuated retractable means for locking said second section against rotation relative to said first section. 4. Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said fluid actuated means comprise a plurality of angularly spaced and axially extending pistons connecting said first and second support members. 5. Apparatus as defined in claim 2 and including releasable spring-biased detent means for retaining said second section of said first support member at said normal position, and control means for sensing movement of said detent means when said second section of said first support member moves from said normal position. 6. Apparatus adapted for connecting tooling to the moveable arm of a robot to provide for precision alignment of a part to be assembled, comprising a first support member adapted to be attached to the arm of a robot, a second support member adapted to be attached to the tooling, means connecting said first and second support members and providing for axial and rotatable movement of said second support member relative to said first support member, fluid actuated means for biasing said second support member axially to a normal position relative to said first support member, said first support member including first and second support sections with said second section supported for rotation relative to said first section, said second support member including first and second support sections separated by a core member, bearing means supporting said core member and said second support section of said second support member for lateral movement of said second support section in two perpendicular linear directions relative to said first support section, linear moveable biasing means for urging said second support section of each said support member to home position relative to said first support section of said support member, said linear moveable biasing means including means defining a set of elongated opposing recesses for said first and second sections of said first support member and corresponding recesses for said first and second support sections of said second support member and said core member, each of said recesses having opposite ends, a pressure biased collapsible plunger within each set of opposing recesses and having opposite end portions engaging said opposite ends of said recesses to form a precision said home position, and electrical control means for sensing movement of said second support member in said axial direction from said normal position and for sensing movement of said second support section laterally in each of said perpendicular directions from said home position relative to said first support section. 7. Apparatus as defined in claim 6 wherein said means for biasing said second support member to said normal rotational position comprise a pinion portion engaging a linear moveable rack, said first support portion including a member cooperating with said rack to define said opposing elongated recesses, and one of said pressure biased collapsible plungers within said opposing recesses for establishing said normal position. 8. Apparatus as defined in claim 6 wherein said linear moveable biasing means for said second section of said first support member includes a rack and pinion, and electrical control means for sensing movement of said rack and corresponding rotation of said second section of said first support member relative to said first section. 9. Apparatus as defined in claim 8 and including releasable spring-biased detent means for retaining said second section of said first support member at said home position, and control means for sensing movement of said detent means when said second section of said first support member moves from said home position.
