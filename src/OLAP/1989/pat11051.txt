The present invention provides an apparatus and method of utilization thereof of a quick disconnect coupling for attaching an end of arm tool (EOAT) to a robot or like wherein there is fluid communication between the robot end of the coupling and the EOAT of the coupling. The coupling of the present invention also is designed so that fluid communication can only occur after the coupling halves are joined and sealed together. Fluid communication is cut off before the coupling halves can separate from each other thereby minimizing leakage during the coupling operation.

A quick disconnect coupling for connecting an end of arm tool (EOAT) with a fluid line to a robot or like with a fluid line, said coupling in combination comprising: a tool adapter for holding said EOAT, said tool adapter having a generally axial central cavity, and at least one generally axially orientated member boarding said central cavity and projecting towards said robot or like, and said tool adapter having a fluid line with a poppet valve biased to a closed position; and a tool changer adapted for sequentially mating, coupling and sealing and then fluidly communicating with said tool adapter, said tool changer being connected with said robot or like, said tool changer including: a shell having a fluid line, and said shell having a generally axial interior chamber and said interior chamber having a first passage fluidly connecting the outside of said shell and said interior chamber, said interior chamber having at least one generally radial aperture intersecting said chamber axially separated from said first passage and towards said tool adapter; a rod slidably mounted in said interior chamber and biased towards said EOAT, said rod having a cam portion adjacent said radial aperture; a locking member movably mounted within said radial aperture for interacting with said cam portion of said rod and said axially orientated member to couple said tool changer with said tool adapter; closure means biased to a first position whereby said radial aperture is closed when said tool changer and said tool adapter are not mated and said closure means being moved to a second position by said axially orientated member to open said radial aperture when said tool changer and said tool adapter are mated, the opening of said radial aperture allowing said biased piston rod to move to a position to cause said locking member to be captured between said cam portion of said rod and said axially orientated member coupling said tool changer with said tool adapter; a stem poppet valve within said fluid line biased to a closed position; means on said shell to seal said fluid line of said tool changer with said fluid line of said tool adapter; and a piston slidably mounted within said interior changer whereby said piston is responsive to a fluid fed within said interior chamber through said first passage to move to a position to engage said tool changer valve stem to open said tool changer valve and to cause said tool changer valve to contact said tool adapter valve, opening said tool adapter valve thereby allowing fluid communication between said tool adapter and said tool changer only after said biased rod has moved to a position coupling said tool changer with said tool adapter and sealing said line of said tool changer with said line of said tool adapter, and whereby said rod cannot return to a position allowing said tool changer to disconnect from said tool adapter until said valves in said tool adapter and tool changer have returned to a closed position. 7. A quick disconnect coupling as described in claim 6 wherein said piston surrounds said rod and wherein there are first and second fluid passages connecting with said interior chamber axially separated from one another by said piston. 8. A tool changer a described in claim 6 wherein said rod has a step portion and piston is slidably mounted on said rod, and after said rod has moved to a locking position, said piston in response to a fluid fed within said interior chamber through said first passage can make contact said step portion of said rod to further engage said rod with said locking member to increase the force of coupling between said tool adapter and said tool changer. 9. A quick disconnect coupling as described in claim 6 wherein the biasing said rod is independent of the position of said piston. 10. A quick disconnect device as described in claim 6 wherein said rod has a flange portion and wherein movement by said piston in response to a fluid fed into said chamber can allow said piston to pull said rod toward said robot or like to disconnect said tool adapter from said tool changer. 11.
