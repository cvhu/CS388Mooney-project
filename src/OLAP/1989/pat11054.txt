An improved gripper for attachment to a robot arm. The gripper system is a stand alone unit with its own controller and has a pair of fingers, both of which are movable in opposite directions. The controller is programmed to direct the operation of the gripper system in response to system input signals. The fingers are controlled by a mechanism for moving the fingers simultaneously in opposite directions with the driving power being supplied by a motor. Feedback from the motor or moving mechanism is provided to a servo mechanism which provides a power signal to the motor through an intermediate amplifier. The servo system compares an input signal from the controller to the feedback signal and causes the motor to move in an appropriate direction.
