There is provided a counterbalance assembly for use in combination with a rotatable robotic arm and the like in a robotic manipulator, where the robotic arm is rotated about an axis by a torque-producing device having a relatively stationary base. The assembly further includes a torsional spring comprising a pair of concentric tubes connected to each other by rubber, with one tube connected to the arm and the other tube connected to the base. In general, any torque created by the influence of gravity acting on the robotic arm, as it is rotated, is counterpoised by torsional wind-up in the spring due to proportional resistance of the rubber to torsional shear. This spring/arm combination thereby reduces the load on the torque-producing device.
Claims What we claim is: 1. A counterbalance assembly in combination with a rotatable arm and the like in a robotic manipulator, wherein such arm is rotated about a rotation axis by a torque producing device, said assembly comprising a torsional spring means for providing an effective counterbalancing force at said rotation axis, said torsional spring means comprising: (a) a resilient member, said resilient member providing resistance to torsional shearing force imposed thereon; (b) an inner housing, said inner housing being attached to said rotation axis for rotation therewith; (c) a substantially hollow outer housing, wherein said resilient member is immovably attached to the outer surface of said inner housing and the inner surface of said outer housing so that said torsional shearing force is imposed on said resilient member in response to rotation of said inner housing relative said outer housing, whereby resistance of said resilient member to said torsional shearing force establishes an effective counterbalancing force which reduces the load bearing on the torque producing device at the rotation axis; and (d) means for limiting rotational movement of said outer housing about said rotational axis, wherein said limiting means comprises: (1) a chock attached to said outer housing for limiting rotational movement of said outer housing in a particular direction, whereby said outer housing is held stationary by engagement of said chock with an immovable portion of said robotic manipulator, and torsional shearing force is imposed on said resilient member by rotation of said inner housing relative said outer housing; and (2) a stop attached to the outer surface of said outer housing at a point substantially opposite said chock, wherein said stop rests against a back stop block on the lower portion of the rotatable robotic arm such that it imparts a slight, predetermined torsional shearing force on said resilient member when said rotatable robotic arm is in a substantially vertical or unrotated position. 2. A counterbalance assembly in combination with a rotatable arm and the like in a robotic manipulator, wherein such arm is rotated about a rotation axis by a torque producing device, said assembly comprising a first and second torsional spring means for providing an effective counterbalancing force at said rotational axis, said first and second torsional spring means each comprising: (a) a resilient member for providing resistance to torsional shearing force imposed thereon, said resilient member having a substantially cylindrical shape and a bore formed therethrough; (b) an inner housing, said inner housing being attached to said rotation axis for rotation therewith; (c) a substantially hollow outer housing, wherein said resilient member is immovably attached about the inner surface of its bore to the outer resurface of said inner housing and about its outer periphery to the inner surface of the outer housing so that torsional shearing force is imposed on said resilient member in response to rotation of said inner housing relative said outer housing; (d) a chock attached to said outer housing for limiting rotational movement of said outer housing about said rotation axis, whereby said first torsional spring means provides an effective counterbalancing force at said rotation axis in response to rotation of said rotatable arm in a forward direction about said rotation axis and said second torsional spring means provides an effective counterbalancing force at said rotation axis in response to rotation of said rotatable arm in a backward direction about said rotation axis; and (e) a stop attached to the outer surface of said outer housing at a point substantially opposite said chock, wherein said stop rests against a back stop block on the lower portion of the rotatable robotic arm such that it imparts a slight, predetermined torsional shearing force on said resilient member when said rotatable robotic arm is in a substantially vertical or unrotated position.
