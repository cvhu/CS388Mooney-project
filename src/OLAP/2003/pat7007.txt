A device for and method of robotically crating objects, such as consumer goods, being capable of securing an upstanding enclosure to a recyclable pallet having structural uprights. The device conveys a pallet and enclosure assembly into a work station, installs a number of threaded fasteners into predetermined locations in the top and two adjacent sides of the assembly, rotates the assembly one-hundred eighty degrees, installs fasteners into the two remaining sides, rotates the assembly back to the initial position, and conveys the secured crate assembly out of the work station. The device includes the ability to detect the number of times a recyclable pallet has been used, and to adjust the exact locations of fasteners accordingly, thereby assuring that new fasteners are always installed into an unused fastener location.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of crating and palletizing an object, said method comprising the steps of: providing a reusable pallet having a supporting platform, an internal, upstanding container-supporting structure, means for indicating prior usage, and a surrounding fastening surface comprised of a plurality of adjacent, articulated fastening surface portions; locating and tying down said object on said platform; enclosing said object and said pallet platform with an upstanding container having an open end and including a marginal fastening area, said marginal fastening area overlapping said plurality of articulated fastening surface portions; reading said prior-usage indicating means to detect prior usage of said pallet in order to determine unused areas of the fastening surface; providing a pre-loaded screwdriver for inserting pre-loaded threaded screws into said fastening surface portions; and controllably inserting the fastening screws through said overlapping container marginal fastening area and into the unused areas of the underlying pallet fastening surface to secure said container to said pallet in response to the reading of said prior usage indicating means. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said pallet platform includes an internal, upstanding container support member having a fastening surface; positioning said container in overlying contact with said support member fastening surface; positioning said preloaded screwdriver in alignment with the fastening surface of said container-support member; and inserting a fastening screw through said container and into the fastening surface of said internal, upstanding container support member. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein the method includes the step of inserting a fastening screw through said container, through said upstanding container support member, and into said pallet fastening surface.
