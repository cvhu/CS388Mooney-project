Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for sorting semiconductor devices where the semiconductor devices have been singulated from a strip containing a plurality of semiconductor devices and where an electronic strip map has been created containing address and quality information related to each individual singulated semiconductor device, the apparatus comprising: a semiconductor device carrier, adapted for receiving a plurality of singulated semiconductor devices, the semiconductor device carrier including a base portion having a top surface divided into a plurality of cavities, each sized to receive an individual singulated semiconductor device, each of the cavities including a vacuum aperture therein; a first transfer mechanism including a rotatable arm adapted for releasably securing the semiconductor device carrier to a portion of the arm, the first transfer mechanism in selective connection with a vacuum source and the vacuum apertures in the cavities of the semiconductor device carrier, wherein the arm of the first transfer mechanism is moveable to a first location adjacent the strip of singulated semiconductor devices wherein the singulated semiconductor devices are secured in corresponding cavities in the semiconductor device carrier under the force of the vacuum source applied through the vacuum apertures and wherein the arm is moveable to a second location; a second transfer mechanism adapted for releasable engagement with the semiconductor device carrier, the second transfer mechanism disposed adjacent to the first transfer mechanism such that when the first transfer mechanism moves to the second position, the second transfer mechanism releasably engages the semiconductor device carrier and disconnects the semiconductor device carrier from the first transfer mechanism and moves the semiconductor device carrier to a carrier unload position; and a semiconductor sorting mechanism including a robotic arm moveable between the carrier unload position and predetermined locations for unloading the semiconductor devices, the robotic arm including a pickup head including a plurality of vacuum ports connected to a vacuum source such that the pickup head vacuum ports are selectively able to extend down from the pickup device and pick up a plurality of singulated semiconductor devices and release the semiconductor devices at a predetermined location; the sorting mechanism including a controller for controlling movement of the robotic arm from the carrier unload position to the predetermined locations and for controlling the vacuum ports of the pickup head for selectively picking up semiconductor devices from the semiconductor device carrier under the force of the vacuum source and releasing the semiconductor device with assistance of compressed air when the pickup head of the robotic arm has reached a predetermined location; wherein the controller receives the electronic strip map information regarding the address and quality of the singulated semiconductor devices located on the semiconductor device carrier and directs the pickup head to selectively pickup a plurality of semiconductor devices from the semiconductor device carrier and transfer the semiconductor devices to a predetermined location to unload the semiconductor devices at that location. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a vision module located adjacent the semiconductor device carrier at the carrier unload position wherein the vision module includes a vision inspection system that visually inspects the semiconductor devices after they have been picked up by the pickup head of the sorting mechanism and wherein the controller receives inspection information from the vision module and updates its electronic strip map information based on the information received from the vision module and adjusts the unload position for any of the particular semiconductor devices for which the electronic strip information has been modified based on the information received from the vision module. 3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the arm of the first transfer mechanism inverts the semiconductor device carrier when the arm moves to the first location adjacent the strip of singulated semiconductor devices to secure the singulated semiconductor devices in corresponding cavities in the semiconductor device carrier and the arm then returns the semiconductor device carrier to its original orientation as the arm moves to the second location which serves to invert the semiconductor devices secured in the carrier at the second location for subsequent transfer to the carrier unload position by the second transfer mechanism.
