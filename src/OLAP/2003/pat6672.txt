This invention relates to silane functional adhesive composition and to a method of bonding a window to a painted substrate using the adhesive without the need for a primer for the painted substrate. In one embodiment, the invention is a method of bonding glass to a painted substrate, such as a window in a vehicle. The process comprises applying to the glass or the unprimed painted substrate an adhesive as described herein; contacting the glass with the unprimed painted substrate wherein the adhesive is located between the window and the substrate; and allowing the adhesive to cure.
