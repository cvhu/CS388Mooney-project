The invention proposes a robot apparatus capable of autonomously performing actions in natural ways. The robot apparatus includes a control unit having emotion/-instinct models linked to the actions and deciding a next action by changing the emotion/instinct models based on the input information. A robot apparatus can be realized which autonomously behaves in accordance with the emotional and instinctive states created in itself, and hence which autonomously behaves in a natural way.
