A device for singulating surgical needles from a bulk supply of needles including a vibratory bowl assembly for receiving said bulk supply of needles. The bowl assembly having a floor to receive the needles, a track extending from the floor to a needle discharge point and a selectively vibrating motor to vibrate the surgical needles into a single file along the track; a discharge device having first and second needle receiving pockets, the device positioning the first and the second needle receiving pockets below said needle discharge point; a controller for selectively vibrating the vibratory bowl and selectively positioning the first and second needle pockets below the needle discharge point, the controller singulating individual needles from the single file of needles into the first and second needle receiving pockets; a discharger for discharging the singulated needles in the first and second needle pockets in a spaced relationship on a conveyor for subsequent imaging at an inspection station.
Claims What is claimed: 1. A device for singulating surgical needles from a bulk supply of needles said device comprising: (a) a vibratory bowl assembly for receiving said bulk supply of needles, said bowl assembly having a floor to receive said needles, a track extending from said floor to a needle discharge point and a selectively vibrating motor to vibrate said surgical needles into a single file along said track; (b) a discharge device having first and second needle receiving pockets, said device positioning said first and said second needle receiving pockets below said needle discharge point; (c) control means for selectively vibrating said vibratory bowl and selectively positioning the first and second needle pockets of said discharge device below said needle discharge point, said control means singulating individual needles from said single file of needles into said first and second needle receiving pockets; (d) means for discharging said singulated needles in said first and second needle pockets in a spaced relationship on a conveyor for subsequent imaging at an inspection station wherein said discharge device is a linear slide mechanism that reciprocates between a first position and a second position, said slide positioning said first needle receiving pocket below the needle discharge point when in said first position. 2. A device for singulating surgical needles for processing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said linear slide includes a pair of pivotal members which together define said first and second needle receiving pockets in a spaced relationship. 3. A device for singulating surgical needles for processing as claimed in claim 2 wherein said means for discharging said singulated needles includes an air slide for pivoting said pivotal members to open said first and second needle receiving pockets.
