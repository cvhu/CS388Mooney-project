A training system includes software installable on an instructor's computer for configuring a plurality of workstations networked thereto. The software is adapted to copy and install an indicated training module including a particular instruction functionality onto a selected student workstation. Once all the workstations are configured as desired, the instructor can invoke additional components of the system, including initiating a running of a training scenario from the instructor's computer on selected workstations. The training scenario includes input provided to the training module, to which a trainee responds, and the instructor can assess the response. A particular embodiment of the invention is for use in an environment wherein coordinated effort by a plurality of workers is required. Such environments may include, but are not intended to be limited to, a command center of a military location.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for training a plurality of students comprising: a plurality of workstations, each including a processor and further including storage means, display means, and input means, all in electronic communication with the processor; an instructor computer in network communication with each of the workstations and including a processor and further including display means, storage means, and input means, all in electronic communication with the processor; a plurality of training modules resident on the instructor computer storage means, each module including a predetermined instruction functionality; and configuration software means resident on and under control of the instructor computer having means for: presenting a toolbar of icons on said instructor display means whereby said icons are selectable as means for: setting up at least one virtual space on said instructor display means to represent an environment such as a military command center, populating said at least one virtual space with a representation of each of said plurality of workstations wherein each representation is adapted to pictorially indicate whether the workstation is active, installing an indicated training module onto a selected workstation storage means by dragging the icon of the indicated training module toolbar to the selected workstation by accessing the instructor computer storage means to retrieve the indicated training module, copying the indicated training module; and installing the copy to the selected workstation storage means, identifying said module in said virtual space by providing a pictorial at said selected workstation representing said module; scenario means resident on the storage means of said instructor computer responsive to said configuration software for differentially playing said scenario simultaneously on each workstation represented within said at least one virtual space; and means at said instructor computer to monitor activity at each workstation represented within said at least one virtual space and provide instructor interaction.
