A centrifuge container transport rack designed with symmetrical opposing sides located over a central pivot. The pivot enables the rack to be utilized in the balancing of centrifuge containers.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A centrifuge labware rack comprising: a beam; a pair of container cages disposed on opposing sides of said beam, said container cages having an open top end and a closed bottom end, said closed bottom end affixed to said beam; and a balance means, said balance means below all other elements of said rack. 2. The rack of claim 1 further comprising a handle mounted on said rack. 3. The rack of claim 2 wherein said handle extends between said container cages. 4. The rack of claim 2 wherein said handle is rotatably movable. 5. The rack of claim 1 further comprising, a first lid holder attached to a first container cage and a second lid holder attached to a second container cage said lid holders disposed symmetrically. 6. A centrifuge labware rack comprising: a beam; a pair of spaced cages disposed on opposing sides of said beam, said cages each having an open top end and a closed bottom end, said closed bottom end affixed to said beam; a rack handle extending between said cages; a balance means; and a pair of spring clips affixed to opposing ends of said beam wherein said clips have sufficient spring force to substantially negate the center-of-gravity shift as mass is balanced with said rack. 7. The rack of claim 6 wherein a spring force of each of said pair of spring clips is equal to one-half-of a weight of said rack.
