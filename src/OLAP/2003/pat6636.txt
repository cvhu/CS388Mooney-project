An ultrasonic scanner for inspection of radiused regions having scanner supports which include pivoted fingers containing the transducers and hands supporting the fingers attached to vertical arms by pins. The angle of the hands are controlled by the vertical position of the arms.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An inspection system for ultrasonic scanning or radii in a structure comprising in combination: an assembly having two arms containing bushings that slide on rods for holding the assembly together; an elastic band for pulling said arms toward each other hand holding the arms against the structure to be inspected; said arms having fingers holding ultrasonic transducers for rotation; said transducers electrically coupled to a pulse receiver; a signal processor coupled to said pulse receiver; said assembly having a robot including positionally encoded motors for producing x and axis scanning location information relative to said structure; said signal processor receiving said z and x axis scanning information relative to said structure; and means for combining the return pulses features with the encoder position to produce two-dimensional images of ultrasonic data for evaluation on a cathode ray tube display. 2. A fixture for automatic ultrasonic scanning of an aerospace structure comprising in combination: two arms containing bushings which slide on rods; an elastic band for pulling said arms towards each other and holding said arms against a part to be inspected; said arms having fingers holding ultrasonic transducers for rotation; and wherein; the orientation of said fingers is controlled by the vertical (z-axis) motion of said fixture relative to said aerospace structure.
