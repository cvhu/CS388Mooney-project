An integrated wafer transport and transfer device is disclosed, which includes a vehicle with an integrated docking platform for holding a wafer carrier such as a FOUP (front opening unified pod). The docking platform is positioned at the correct height for sealing the FOUP to the load lock of a process tool. Vertical and/or horizontal movement is required in some cases. Methods for delivering wafers to process tools are also described. In a preferred embodiment, wafers are carried inside a FOUP on a cart, such as an automatically guided vehicle or a personally guided vehicle. The cart is docked at a process tool and the FOUP is sealed to the load lock of the tool without removing the FOUP from the cart. After processing on one tool, the cart along with the FOUP can be moved to the next process tool for further processing. The FOUP can stay on the same cart until all processing is completed. This is especially useful for moving priority lots through the fabrication facility quickly.
Claims I claim: 1. An integrated wafer transport and transfer device comprising: a vehicle with an integrated docking platform; a wafer carrier positioned on the docking platform; an elevator for the integrated docking platform to set the wafer carrier at a position suitable for loading wafers into a process tool; a horizontal movement control to adjust the position of the integrated docking platform on the vehicle; and a latching mechanism to hold the vehicle in place at the process tool. 2. The device of claim 1 wherein the wafer carrier is a FOUP (front opening unified pod). 3. The device of claim 1 wherein the vehicle is a personally guided vehicle (PGV). 4. The device of claim 1 wherein the vehicle is an automatically guided vehicle (AGV). 5. An integrated transport and docking device for a wafer FOUP (front opening unified pod) comprising: a transport cart; a docking platform on the transport cart wherein the docking platform holds the FOUP at a height where it can seal against a front face of a process tool; a latch to hold the transport cart in place at the process tool; and an automatic device to adjust the position of the docking platform horizontally to seal the FOUP against the front face of the process tool. 6. The device of claim 5, further comprising on the vehicle an elevator that sets the docking platform at a height where the FOUP can seal against the front face of the process tool. 7. A method for processing wafers in a fabrication facility, comprising: storing the wafers in a wafer carrier; carrying the wafer carrier on a vehicle wherein the wafer carrier is held on a docking platform at a height of a load port of a process tool; latching the vehicle to the process tool; and moving the docking platform exclusively horizontally to seal the wafer carrier against a front face of the load port of the process tool using a horizontal movement control integrated into the vehicle. 8. The method of claim 7 wherein the wafer carrier is a FOUP. 9. The method of claim 7 wherein the horizontal movement control operates manually. 10. The method of claim 7 wherein the horizontal movement control operates automatically. 11. The method of claim 7, further comprising using a robot to transfer wafers between the FOUP and the process tool. 12. The method of claim 11 further comprising, after processing is complete, using the horizontal movement control to move the docking platform away from the process tool onto a transport position on the vehicle. 13. The method of claim 7, further comprising keeping a particular FOUP and a particular vehicle together as they move from one process tool to another. 14. The method of claim 7 wherein the vehicle is a personally guided vehicle (PGV). 15. The method of claim 7 wherein the vehicle is an automatically guided vehicle (AGV). 16. The method of claim 15 wherein the AGV is programmed to take the wafer carrier along a specific path from one process tool to another until an entire wafer processing sequence is completed. 17. A method of transferring wafers to a process tool comprising: carrying the wafers inside a front opening unified pod (FOUP) on a cart; docking the cart at the process tool; sealing the FOUP to a load lock of the process tool without removing the FOUP from the cart; and using a process tool robot to transfer wafers between the FOUP and the process tool while the FOUP is still on the cart.
