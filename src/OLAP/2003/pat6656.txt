The device and method prevents a robot from carrying two blanks stuck together i.e., a double blank, from being transported storage station to a workstation. Suction cups on the robot arm grip the blank. The robot transports the blank to a double blank separation station, which has suction cups facing the opposite side of the blank. If the blank is a double blank, the opposing force from the suction cups pulls the blanks apart. The robot carries the separated single blank to the workstation. Instead of returning to the storage station to obtain another blank, the robot returns to the double blank separation station to pick up the separated blank that remained there.
Claims We claim: 1. In a system for transporting blanks from a storage station to a workstation comprising a transporter movable between the storage station and the workstation and a blank gripper on the transporter, selectively applying a gripping force or releasing the gripping force on a blank, the improvement comprising the provision of: a double blank separation station mounted in a fixed position, which is accessible by the transporter, the double blank separation station having a double blank gripper selectively applying a gripping force in a direction opposite to the gripping force applied by the blank gripper; and a controller, the controller controlling movement of the transporter from the storage station, then to the double blank separation station and then to the workstation irrespective of the number of blanks being transported by the transporter, the improvement further comprising the provision of the double blank separation station comprising a base, at least one guide connected to the base for directing a blank to a position on the double blank separation station. 2. A double blank separator apparatus for separating a double blank carried by a transporter from a storage station to a workstation, the apparatus comprising: a) transporter blank gripping means on the transporter for selectively applying a gripping force or releasing the gripping force on a blank; b) double blank gripping means positioned to contact a double blank carried by the transporter, for applying a force on the double blank in a direction opposite to the gripping force applied by the transporter blank gripping means; c) a controller, the controller controlling movement of the transporter from the storage station, then to the double blank separation means and then to the workstation irrespective of the number of blanks being transported by the transporter, d) a base, wherein the double blank gripping means comprises at least one arm positioned relative to the base, at least one double blank suction cup positioned on each arm, and e) further comprising at least one guide connected to the base for directing a blank to a position on the double blank separation station. 3. A process for preventing a transporter from transporting a double blank instead of a single blank to a workstation from a stack of blanks at a storage station, the stack of blanks having an exposed blank, the process comprising: a) moving the transporter to the exposed blank of the stack of blanks at the storage station; b) applying a gripping force from the transporter on the exposed blank; c) moving the transporter away from the stack of blanks while applying the gripping force on the exposed blank to remove from the stack of blanks, a blank structure, the blank structure comprising the exposed blank or the exposed blank and at least one other blank from the stack of blanks; d) transporting the blank structure to a double blank separation station; e) applying at the double blank separation station a double blank releasing force on the blank structure in a direction opposite the gripping force from the transporter, the double blank releasing force being applied while the gripping force is applied and being less than the gripping force, whereby the resulting force from the gripping force and the double blank releasing force separating the blanks if the blank structure comprises at least two blanks and releasing the exposed blank if the blank structure comprises only the exposed blank, whereby, the exposed blank remains on the transporter; and f) transporting the exposed blank to the workstation. 4. The process of claim 3 further comprising sensing whether a blank remains at the double blank separation station after the exposed blank is removed from the double blank separation station, and, if a blank remains at the double blank separation station, returning the transporter to the double blank separation station before the transporter returns to the storage station; applying the gripping force from the transporter to the blank at the double blank separation station; moving the transporter away from the double blank separation station to remove the blank from the double blank separation station; and transporting the blank to the workstation. 5. The process of claim 3 wherein the transporter moves to the double blank separation station each time it moves from the storage station to the workstation.
