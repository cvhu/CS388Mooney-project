Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 34, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 13, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 33, 38, 41 or 45 which specifically hybridizes with a nucleic acid encoding Dual specific phosphatase 9 and inhibits the expression of Dual specific phosphatase 9. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of Dual specific phosphatase 9 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of Dual specific phosphatase 9 is inhibited. 11. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
