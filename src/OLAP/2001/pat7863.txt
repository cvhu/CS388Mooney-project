The present invention provides a method for detecting a target nucleic acid species including the steps of providing an array of probes affixed to a substrate and a plurality of labeled probes wherein each labeled probe is selected to have a first nucleic acid sequence which is complementary to a first portion of a target nucleic acid and wherein the nucleic acid sequence of at least one probe affixed to the substrate is complementary to a second portion of the nucleic acid sequence of the target, the second portion being adjacent to the first portion; applying a target nucleic acid to the array under suitable conditions for hybridization of probe sequences to complementary sequences; introducing a labeled probe to the array; hybridizing a probe affixed to the substrate to the target nucleic acid; hybridizing the labeled probe to the target nucleic acid; affixing the labeled probe to an adjacently hybridized probe in the array; and detecting the labeled probe affixed to the probe in the array.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for sequencing a repetitive sequence in a target nucleic acid comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of spacer oligonucleotides of varying lengths wherein each spacer oligonucleotide in said plurality of spacer oligonucleotides includes at least one repeat of said repetitive sequence; providing a first oligonucleotide that is adjacent to a first end of the repetitive sequence; providing a plurality of second oligonucleotides at least one of which is adjacent to a second end of the repetitive sequence, wherein each oligonucleotide in the plurality of second oligonucleotides is labeled; hybridizing the first oligonucleotide, one of the plurality of second oligonucleotides, and one of the plurality of spacer oligonucleotides to the target nucleic acid under conditions that discriminate a perfect match hybrid from a base pair mismatch hybrid; ligating the hybridized oligonucleotides; separating ligated oligonucleotides from unligated oligonucleotides; and determining a sequence of the repetitive sequence by identifying the spacer oligonucleotide and the second oligonucleotide in the ligated oligonucleotides. 2. A method for determining the order of a plurality of sequence subfragments comprising the steps of: providing a first oligonucleotide that is complementary to a first portion of a the branch point sequence wherein the first oligonucleotide extends from a first end of the branch point sequence by at least one nucleotide, providing a plurality of labeled oligonucleotides that are complementary to a second portion of the branch point sequence wherein each labeled oligonucleotide in said plurality of labeled oligonucleotides includes a sequence portion that extends from a second end of the branch point sequence by at least one nucleotide, the sequence portion including a sequence that is complementarty to one of a plurality of possible sequences that extend from the second end of the branch point sequence; hybridizing the first oligonucleotide and at least one of the plurality of labeled oligonucleotides to a target nucleic acid; ligating the hybridized first oligonucleotide to the hybridized labeled oligonucleotide; detecting the labeled oligonucleotide that ligates to the first oligonucleotide; and detemining the order of the sequence subfragments from the identity of the labeled oligonucleotide that ligates to the first oligonucleotide. 3. A method for sequencing a repetitive sequence in a target nucleic acid comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of spacer oligonucleotides of varying lengths wherein each spacer oligonucleotide in said plurality of spacer oligonucleotides includes at least one repeat of said repetitive sequence; providing a first oligonucleotide that is adjacent to a first end of the repetitive sequence; providing a second oligonucleotide that is adjacent to a second end of the repetitive sequence, wherein the second oligonucleotide is labeled; hybridizing the first oligonucleotide, the second oligonucleotide, and one of the plurality of spacer oligonucleotides to the target nucleic acid under conditions that discriminate between perfect matches and a base pair mismatch hybrid; ligating the hybridized oligonucleotides; separating ligated oligonucleotides from unligated oligonucleotides; and determining a sequence of the repetitive sequence in the target nucleic acid by identifying the spacer oligonucleotide that ligated to the first and second oligonucleotide.
