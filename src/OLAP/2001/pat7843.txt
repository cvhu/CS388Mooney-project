A system is presented that creates vision-based, three-dimensional control of a multiple-degree-of-freedom dexterous robot, without special calibration of the vision system, the robot, or any of the constituent parts of the system, and that allows high-level human supervision or direction of the robot. The human operator uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to point and click on an image of the surface of the object with which the robot is to interact. Directed at this surface is the stationary selection camera, which provides the image for the GUI, and at least one other camera. A laser pointer is panned and tilted so as to create, in each participating camera space, targets associated with surface junctures that the user has selected in the selection camera. Camera-space manipulation is used to control the internal degrees of freedom of the robot such that selected points on the robot end member move relative to selected surface points in a way that is consistent with the desired robot operation. As per the requirement of camera-space manipulation, the end member must have features, or "cues", with known location relative to the controlled end-member points, that can be located in the images or camera spaces of participant cameras. The system is extended to simultaneously control tool orientation relative to the surface normal and/or relative to user-selected directions tangent to the surface. The system is extended in various ways to allow for additional versatility of application.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A camera-space manipulation means for allowing human supervisory control of a dexterous manipulator comprising a manipulator means with an end-member means, at least one cue means with known three-dimensional coordinates relative to said end-member means, a designated point P fixed relative to said end member means, which designated point's three-dimensional coordinates relative to the same end member means may be defined according to the task; a selection-camera means; a workpiece which is the object of the intended action of the manipulator means; a computer monitor means; a graphical-user-interface means by which the human supervisor may make a selection of the x coordinate and y coordinate of each of one or more target points; at least one other camera means; a laser-pointer means able to project small light spots onto the workpiece surface; a pan-tilt means for bearing and directing said laser pointer means; and a host computer means and associated computer-interface means able to receive and process user input, and able to send outputs pertaining to commanded internal manipulator joint angles to the manipulator means; outputs pertaining to the commanded pan and tilt angles of the pan-tilt means, outputs pertaining to the commanded on or off state of the laser-pointer means, and outputs pertaining to the triggering of acquisition of a digital form of image of each camera means whereby the human supervisor specifies one or more target points on the physical workpiece surface in the image of the camera space of the selection camera means by using the graphical-user-interface means while viewing the image of the workpiece surface in the camera space of the selection camera means with the computer monitor means, whereupon two-dimensional selection-camera target points are identified with two-dimensional camera-space target points of the other cameras, consistently with corresponding physical workpiece-surface target points as chosen by the user in the camera space of the selection camera through the detection and location in the camera spaces of both the selection camera and the other cameras of centers of placed laser spots which laser spots are placed by the laser-pointer means in which laser-spot placement is achieved by computer control of the pan/tilt means to point the laser pointer means using incremental responses in the x direction and y direction of spot-center location in the selection-camera means camera space due to incremental panning or tilting of the pan/tilt means, and where user-designated point P, which point location or sequence of locations relative to the aforementioned end-member means the user may input to the computer means according to the required task, and which point P will be located physically by computer command of the manipulator means internal degrees of freedom, which internal degree-of-freedom values are determined using camera-space manipulation, with its attendant use of the aforementioned one or more visual cue means and appearances thereof in each camera, to coincide with selected surface points and where, for certain kinds of desired action of the manipulator means, in addition to the physical positioning of designated point P, the manipulator means' degrees of freedom given a number of degrees of freedom of the manipulator means which is large enough, generally totaling five or six rotations, or translations, to meet both the position requirements of the positioning of P and two or three additional specifications of orientation, may be used to align a user-prescribed axis of the tool with the workpiece's surface normal, which surface normal alignment is achieved from the placed laser spots appearances in each camera together with camera-space manipulation and may be used to achieve prescribed tool orientation relative to a particular direction in the plane of the surface near placed spots, which tangent plane tool orientation also is achieved from the placed laser spots appearances in each camera together with camera-space manipulation. 2. The system of claim 1 where the human supervisor controls directly the laser-pointer direction, through direct control of the pan/tilt means. 3. The system of claim 1 where a multiple-spot laser pointer means is introduced that is also under computer on/off control whereby multiple light spots are applied simultaneously to the workpiece surface in order to produce camera-space objectives in all camera means which are consistent and compatible with the target points. 4. The system of claim 1 where control of force of resistance acting on the tool normal to the workpiece surface is achieved in place of position control in said normal direction, and where in-plane position is also controlled, which control of normal force of resistance is achieved by selecting P such that tool-tip depth beneath the resisting workpiece surface is in keeping with an effective stiffness function which relates said attempted tool-tip displacement into the workpiece surface to the normal force of resistance. 5. The system of claim 1 whereby a human operator, during maneuver execution, adjusts components of designated point P's position during maneuver execution whereby the position of the tool relative to the surface is adjusted during maneuver progress.
