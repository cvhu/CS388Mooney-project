An off-line teaching apparatus includes an operation command-receiving device for receiving an operation command inputted via an input/output port from a key input device or a coordinate input device and successively storing the operation command in a buffer; an operation command-reading device for successively reading the operation command stored in the buffer; an operation command-counting device for counting a number of operation commands stored in the buffer; and a confirmation sound-generating device for generating confirmation sound upon receipt of the operation command by the operation command-receiving device when a counted value obtained by the operation command-counting device is not less than a predetermined number. Accordingly, the operator is informed, in real time, of the fact that the system responds to the input of the operation command from the operator. Thus, it is possible to improve the operability of the off-line teaching.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An off-line teaching apparatus, comprising: a coordinate input device; a monitor having a display screen, in which a robot model displayed on the display screen of said monitor performs a display action on said display screen, for indicating movement of said robot model on said display screen on the basis of an operation command supplied from said coordinate input device; and coordinate input processing means for processing inputs received through said coordinate input device, comprising an insensitive zone-setting means for setting a width of said insensitive zone perpendicular to a direction of movement of a specified joint of said robot model, wherein when said coordinate input device is operated along said direction of movement of said specified joint, if movement of said coordinate input device involves movement within said insensitive zone which is previously set, then only movement of said specified joint of said displayed robot model is permitted. 2. The off-line teaching apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said coordinate input processing means further comprises: a coordinate-reading means for reading inputted coordinate data from said coordinate input device with a predetermined time width; a joint-specifying means for specifying said joint of said robot model on the basis of coordinate data inputted at an initial stage; a judging means for judging whether or not said inputted coordinate data is within a range of said preset insensitive zone; and a display-regulating means for permitting only movement of said joint specified by said joint-specifying means if a result of judgment obtained by said judging means is an affirmative judgment. 3. An offline teaching method for an offline teaching apparatus for effecting movement of a robot model on a display screen based on operational commands from at least one input device comprising the steps of: operating a coordinate input device as one of said input devices along a direction of movement of one specified joint of said robot model; presetting an insensitive zone as a width direction perpendicular to said direction of movement; and permitting movement only of said specified joint of said displayed robot model, if operating said coordinate input device causes movement of the robot model into the present insensitive zone.
