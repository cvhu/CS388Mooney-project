A Method of stacking product directly from a conveyor, comprising the steps of conveying a product toward the end of a conveyor; supporting a leading edge of the produce as the leading edge exists the conveyor; releasing the leading edge and a following edge of the product with such timing as to cause the product to fall substantially flat onto a platform; and articulating the conveyor, whereby product is stacked in a pattern.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of delivering product having a bottom surface directly from a conveyor, comprising the steps of: conveying a product having a bottom surface toward an exit end of a conveyor; and using a device to support the bottom surface of the product beyond the exit end of the conveyor as the product exits the conveyor and subsequently to release the bottom surface of the product from support by the device with such timing as to cause the product to fall substantially flat onto a platform. 2. The method of claim 1 in which the supporting step comprises extending a tongue and the releasing step comprises retracting the tongue. 3. The method of claim 2 further comprising the step of sensing the location of the product relative to the location of the tongue. 4. The method of claim 1 having the further step of sensing the location of the product relative to the location of an end of the conveyor. 5. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of orienting the product. 6. The method of claim 5 in which the product is oriented by orienting belts traveling at different speeds. 7. The method of claim 1 comprising the additional step of articulating the conveyor. 8. The method of claim 7 in which the conveyor is articulated by pivoting. 9. The method of claim 5 in which the orienting step is effected by an arched orienting conveyor. 10. The method of claim 6 in which the orienting belts are arched.
