A mixture of beads from a combinatorial library is held in suspension in a liquid by movement of the liquid induced by a vertically reciprocating paddle. The tips of needles in an array are immersed in the suspension, a slot being provided in the paddle to avoid collision with the needles. Liquid is drawn into the needles until a bead becomes attached to the tip of each needle. Excess beads adhering to the needles are shaken off by an electromagnetically operated vibrator, and the beads are deposited in wells of a well plate by applying a short burst of pressure to the interiors of the needles. Liquid and any debris within the needles are thereafter discharged to a receptacle by applying a higher pressure burst to the interiors of the needles.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for arraying beads which comprises: a vessel containing a mixture comprising beads in a liquid, the vessel having an interior defined by a top opening, side walls and a bottom; a paddle within the vessel and immersed in the liquid therein; means for effecting reciprocating movement of the paddle within the liquid along a path having a vertical component; an array of hollow elements, each having an internal passage and an opening at an end of the internal passage, the opening being circular in shape so that it can be substantially closed off by a spherical bead, the array being insertable into the vessel so that all of the openings of the elements are immersed in the liquid within the vessel; means for drawing liquid from the vessel into the internal passages of the hollow elements through their openings, for establishing a pressure differential across each opening such that the external pressure exerted on a bead closing off the opening of each hollow element is greater than the pressure within the passage of the same hollow element, thereby holding the bead in engagement with the opening; and means for withdrawing the array of hollow elements from the vessel with beads in engagement with the openings thereof and for moving the array to a remote location for deposition of the bead; in which the vessel has horizontal cross-sections, and the paddle has a top and a bottom, and a horizontal projection the area of which is sufficient in comparison to the horizontal cross-sections of the vessel that movement of the paddle within the liquid along said path induces a substantial vertical movement of the liquid, whereby the beads are maintained in suspension in the liquid by the substantial vertical movement of the liquid induced by the paddle as the paddle reciprocates, and in which the paddle comprises at least two adjacent slots allowing flow of liquid through the paddle, each said slot having a relatively narrow opening at the bottom of the paddle, a relatively wide opening at the top of the paddle and sloping side walls, a side wall of one of said two adjacent slots meeting a side wall of the other of said two adjacent slots along a narrow ridge at the top of the paddle. 2. Apparatus according to claim 1, in which the hollow elements are elongated needles spaced from one another and insertable into one of said slots in the paddle, and in which the means for effecting reciprocating movement of the paddle within the liquid effects movement of the paddle through a range such that, when the needles are inserted into the vessel, the needles extend into said one of said slots in the paddle as the paddle reciprocates. 3. An apparatus for arraying beads which comprises: a vessel containing a mixture comprising beads in a liquid, the vessel having an interior defined by a top opening, side walls and a bottom; a paddle within the vessel and immersed in the liquid therein; means for effecting reciprocating movement of the paddle within the liquid along a path having a vertical component; an array of hollow elements, each having an internal passage and an opening at an end of the internal passage, the opening being circular in shape so that it can be substantially closed off by a spherical bead, the array being insertable into the vessel so that all of the openings of the elements are immersed in the liquid within the vessel; means for drawing liquid from the vessel into the internal passages of the hollow elements through their openings, for establishing a pressure differential across each opening such that the external pressure exerted on a bead closing off the opening of each hollow element is greater than the pressure within the passage of the same hollow element, thereby holding the bead in engagement with the opening; and means for withdrawing the array of hollow elements from the vessel with beads in engagement with the openings thereof and for moving the array to a remote location for deposition of the beads, in which the vessel has horizontal cross-sections, and the paddle has a horizontal projection the area of which is sufficient in comparison to the horizontal cross-sections of the vessel that movement of the paddle within the liquid along said path induces a substantial vertical movement of the liquid, whereby the beads are maintained in suspension in the liquid by the substantial vertical movement of the liquid induced by the paddle as it reciprocates, in which the hollow elements are elongated needles spaced from one another, in which the paddle comprises at least one opening into which the needles can extend when the needles are inserted into the vessel, and in which the means for effecting reciprocating movement of the paddle within the liquid effects movement of the paddle through a range such that, when the needles are inserted into the vessel, the needles extend into the opening of the paddle as the paddle reciprocates. 4. An apparatus according to claim 3, in which the means for effecting reciprocating movement of the paddle within the liquid, moves the paddle reciprocably in a path parallel to the elongation of the needles. 5. A process for arraying beads which comprises: establishing, in a vessel, a mixture comprising beads in a liquid; maintaining the beads in suspension in the liquid by reciprocation of a paddle immersed in the liquid; inserting an array of hollow elements, each having an internal passage with an opening smaller than any one of the beads, into the vessel so that all of the openings of the elements are immersed in the liquid within the vessel; drawing liquid from the vessel into each hollow element of the array through the opening thereof, until each of the openings is closed off by one of the beads; establishing a pressure differential across each opening such that the external pressure exerted on the bead closing off the opening of each hollow element is greater than the pressure within the passage of the same hollow element, thereby holding the bead in engagement with the opening; withdrawing the array of hollow elements from the vessel with beads in engagement with the openings thereof; moving the array to a remote location; and depositing the beads at the remote location; in which the reciprocation of the paddle is continued as the array of hollow elements is inserted into the vessel, and in the course of the reciprocation of the paddle, while the hollow elements are immersed in the liquid within the vessel, the hollow elements extend into an opening extending through the paddle and the paddle is moved to a level above a level at which the openings of the elements are located. 6. A process according to claim 5 in which the reciprocation of the paddle takes place in a substantially vertical path. 7. A process according to claim 5 in which the reciprocation of the paddle within the liquid induces a substantial vertical movement of the liquid whereby the beads are maintained in suspension in the liquid by the substantial vertical movement of the liquid induced by the paddle as it reciprocates. 8. A process according to claim 5 in which the reciprocation of the paddle takes place in a substantially vertical path and induces a substantial vertical movement of the liquid whereby the beads are maintained in suspension in the liquid by the substantial vertical movement of the liquid induced by the paddle as it reciprocates.
