Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for transferring wafers, comprising: (a) a wafer transfer chamber; (b) a load lock chamber mounted on the wafer transfer chamber; (c) a processing chamber mounted on the wafer transfer chamber; (d) a robot positioned in the wafer transfer chamber, the robot comprising a dual wafer blade, a first rotating member, a second rotating member, and an arm assembly connecting the first and second rotating members to the dual wafer blade, wherein the arm assembly comprises first and second struts pivotally connected to the blade assembly and wherein the first and second struts are interlocked by two metal straps; and (e) a controller comprising program code for moving the wafer blade on a time optimal path through the transfer chamber, wherein the time optimal path comprises one or more regions of simultaneous radial and rotational movement of the wafer blade and the time optimal path comprises optimal velocities for an optimal path halfway between paths followed by wafers on the dual wafer blade. 2. An apparatus for transferring wafers, comprising: a first rotating member; a second rotating member; a first actuating member to rotate the first rotating member; a second actuating member to rotate the second rotating member, wherein the first and second actuating members are magnetically coupled to the first and second rotating members; a blade assembly having at least first and second wafer blades; an arm assembly connecting the first and second rotating members to the blade assembly, wherein the arm assembly comprises two arms each having a first and a second strut, wherein each second strut is pivotally connected to the blade assembly, and wherein the second struts are interlocked by two metal straps; and a controller for moving the wafer blade assembly on a time optimal path, wherein the time optimal path comprises one or more regions of simultaneous radial and rotational movement of the wafer blade. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 wherein the time optimal path comprises optimal velocities for an optimal path halfway between paths followed by wafers on the first and second wafer blades. 4.
