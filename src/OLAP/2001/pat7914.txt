A system for shielding a robot arm against being splashed with fluids comprises a protective shell-like cover of thin-walled plastic material impervious to fluids which is removably attached to the robot arm. The protective cover has a contoured shape generally conforming to the configuration of the robot arm and includes an upper member overlying the upwardly facing surfaces of the robot arm and an integral continuous side member proximally overlying the sidewall of the robot arm and extending to a lower rim generally coplanar with the downwardly facing surfaces of the robot arm. The upper member of the protective cover generally overlies the upwardly facing surface of the robot arm while the peripherally extending sidewall generally overlies the outwardly facing surface of the peripherally extending sidewall. In similar fashion, a protective plate of thin-walled plastic material impervious to fluids may also be removably attached to the downwardly facing surfaces of the robot arm and includes a peripheral rim generally coextensive with the peripherally extending sidewall of the link and proximate the lower rim of the protective cover when both the protective cover and the protective plate are so attached. With this construction, any splashing issuing from any direction and directed toward the robot arm is caused to impinge upon the protective cover and the protective plate thereby protecting the link of the robot arm to which it is attached.

A shielding system as set forth in claim 1, wherein the protective cover is removable; and including: fastener means for releasably attaching the protective cover to the link, whereby upon the occurrence of sufficient deterioration, the protective cover can be removed from the link and replaced with a fresh protective cover. 3. A shielding system as set forth in claim 1, wherein the protective cover is attached to one link and has a first aperture for freely receiving therethrough an operating shaft and includes an upstanding lip at the periphery of the first aperture projecting to a location proximate the downwardly facing surface of the second link and with a protective plate. 4. A shielding system as set forth in claim 1 wherein the protective cover is attached to a first link and has a first aperture for freely receiving therethrough an operating shaft and includes an upstanding lip at the periphery of the first aperture, wherein the protective plate is attached to a second link adjacent the first link and has a second aperture generally coextensive with the first aperture for freely receiving therethrough an operating shaft connecting the first and second adjacent links and includes a depending lip at the periphery of the second aperture; and wherein the depending lip at the periphery of the second aperture is proximate to, coaxial with, and has an opening which is greater in size than that of the upstanding lip at the periphery of the first aperture. 5. A shielding system as set forth in claim 1 wherein the protective cover is attached to one link and has a first aperture for freely receiving therethrough an operating shaft and includes an upstanding lip at the periphery of the first aperture projecting to a location proximate the downwardly facing surface of the link. 6. A shielding system as set forth in claim 1 wherein the protective plate is substantially planar. 7. A shielding system as set forth in claim 1 wherein the protective shell-like cover has an access opening aligned with an opening in the link for permitting entry from exterior regions to the interior of the link and a cap attachable to the protective shell-like cover for releasably covering the access opening. 8. A shielding system as set forth in claim 4 wherein the upstanding lip projects into the first aperture. 9. A method of shielding each link of a multi-link robot arm against being splashed with fluids, each link including upwardly facing surfaces and downwardly facing surfaces and a peripherally extending sidewall having outwardly facing surfaces and extending between the upwardly and downwardly facing surfaces, the shielding method comprising the steps of: (a) providing a protective shell-like cover of thin-walled plastic material impervious to the fluids, the protective cover having a contoured shape congruently conforming to the configuration of a link and including an upper member overlying the upwardly facing surfaces of the link and an integral continuous side member proximally overlying the sidewall of the link and extending to a lower rim projecting beyond a plane of the downwardly facing surfaces of the link, the protective cover being biased by its contoured shape such that with the upper member proximately overlying the upwardly facing surface, the continuous side member is caused to move into congruent engagement with the outwardly facing surfaces of the peripherally extending sidewall; (b) providing a substantially protective plate of thin-walled plastic material impervious to the fluids adapted to be removably attached to the downwardly facing surfaces of each link of the robot arm, the protective plate including a peripheral rim generally coextensive with the peripherally extending sidewall of the link and proximate the lower rim of the protective cover when both the protective cover and the protective plate are attached thereto; and (c) removably attaching the protective shell-like cover to each link of the robot arm such that any splashing of the robot arm issuing from an elevated location and directed toward the robot arm is caused to impinge upon the protective cover thereby protecting the link of the robot arm to which it is attached. 10. A method as set forth in claim 9 including the steps of: (d) providing the protective cover as a removable item; and (e) releasably attaching the protective cover to the link by fastener means whereby, upon the occurrence of sufficient deterioration, the protective cover can be removed from the link and replaced with a fresh protective cover. 11.
