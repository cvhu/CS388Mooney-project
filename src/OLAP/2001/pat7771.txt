Systems, methods, graphical user interfaces, and articles of manufacture consistent with the present invention allow for biological assay preparation and automated biological macromolecule purification. Consistent with the present invention, a user may instruct the system to perform a series of assay preparation and purification procedures. A user may choose a series of procedures to be performed by a single automated workstation, one after the other, without human intervention. A user may specify, for example, a combination of lysis, archive, purification, and isolation protocols, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For each chosen procedure, a user may select a standard protocol or create a new protocol. Parameters for each of the protocols are cross-checked against parameters of other chosen protocols and system hardware for physical and rational limitations.
