An ergonomic loading assembly for an I/O port onto which a bare cassette may be easily loaded and unloaded. The loading assembly further provides isolation between the operator and the I/O port after loading of a cassette to minimize safety risks and to minimize the amount of particulates and contaminants around the workpieces while on the port. In a preferred embodiment, the loading assembly includes a cover assembly having a stationary cover section around the port plate, and two pivoting cover sections which open and close like jaws to allow a cassette to positioned within the cover assembly when opened and which enclose the cassette within the cover assembly when closed. The loading assembly further includes a pivoting deck onto which the cassette is loaded when the pivoting cover sections are open. The deck receives the cassette with the workpieces oriented at or near vertical. Thereafter, as the pivoting cover sections are closed, the pivoting deck rotates the cassette and seats the cassette on the port door of the port with the workpieces positioned in a horizontal orientation. Thereafter, the port plate, pivoting deck and cassette may be transferred away from the port plate so that processing of the workpieces in the cassette by the processing tool may take place.
Claims We claim: 1. A loading assembly for loading a bare cassette supporting at least one workpiece into a processing station, the loading assembly comprising: a SMIF input/output port having a port door and a port plate surrounding said port door, said port door moving vertically with respect to said port plate into the processing station; a stationary cover section mounted to said port plate; a pivoting cover section pivotally mounted with respect to said stationary cover section to move between a first position where a cassette may be loaded into said stationary cover section, and a second position where said pivoting cover section and said stationary cover section substantially isolate the cassette loaded into said stationary cover section from ambient atmospheric conditions; and a mechanism for receiving the cassette in an orientation where the cassette supports a workpiece in a substantially vertical orientation, and for rotating the cassette until the cassette supports the workpiece in a substantially horizontal orientation. 2. A cover assembly for a SMIF port, the SMIF port having a port door and a port plate surrounding the port door, the port door moving vertically with respect to the port plate to introduce a bare cassette into a processing station, comprising: a stationary cover section mounted to the port plate; a pivoting cover section mounted with said stationary cover section, to pivot between a first position in which the cassette may be loaded into said stationary cover section and a second position in which said stationary cover section and said pivoting cover section create a controlled environment for the cassette loaded into said stationary cover section; and a mechanism for receiving the cassette in an orientation where the cassette supports a workpiece in a substantially vertical orientation, and for rotating the cassette until the cassette supports the workpiece in a substantially horizontal orientation. 3. A cover assembly for a SMIF port having a port door and a port plate surrounding the port door, the port door moving vertically with respect to the port plate to introduce a bare cassette into a processing station, comprising: a stationary cover section mounted to the port plate; a pivoting cover section mounted with said stationary cover section, to pivot between a first position in which the cassette may be loaded into said stationary cover section and a second position in which said stationary cover section and said pivoting cover section create a controlled environment for the cassette loaded into said stationary cover section; and a mechanism for receiving the cassette in an orientation where the cassette supports a workpiece in a substantially vertical orientation, and for rotating the cassette within the cover assembly until the cassette supports the workpiece in a substantially horizontal orientation.
