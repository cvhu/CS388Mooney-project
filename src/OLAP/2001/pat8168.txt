An apparatus and method for monitoring the level of a semiconductor processing chamber susceptor and the inclination of a wafer residing within a pocket of the susceptor. In one embodiment, a light beam transmitter is positioned to direct a light beam, such as a laser beam, onto the top surface of a wafer that has been positioned within a susceptor pocket. The light beam forms a target spot of a particular size and shape on the surface of the wafer. A camera is positioned to observe the target spot. A change in the angular orientation of the wafer or susceptor will result in a change in the size and shape of the target spot. The camera is configured to detect changes in the target spot size and shape. A logic circuit is provided at the output of the camera to correlate the observed shape and size of the target spot to a value indicative of the levelness of the susceptor and/or the inclination of a wafer located within the pocket of the susceptor. In another embodiment, the light beam is focused directly onto a surface of the susceptor. In this manner, the levelness and movement of the susceptor itself may be monitored.
