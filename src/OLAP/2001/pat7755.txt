The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A compound targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding TERT, wherein the compound consists of SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, or 26 and wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of TERT. 14. The compound of claim 13 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 15. The compound of claim 14 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 16. The compound of claim 15 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 17. The compound of claim 14 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 18. The compound of claim 17 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 19. The compound of claim 14 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 20. The compound of claim 19 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 21. The compound of claim 14 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 22. A composition comprising the compound of claim 13 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 23. The composition of claim 22 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 24. The composition of claim 22 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 25. A method of inhibiting the expression of TERT in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of TERT is inhibited. 26. A method of inhibiting the expression of TERT in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 13 so that expression of TERT is inhibited. 27. A method of modulating apoptosis in a cell comprising contacting said cell in vitro with the compound of claim 1, whereby apoptosis is modulated. 28. A method of modulating apoptosis in a cell comprising contacting said cell in vitro with the compound of claim 13, whereby apoptosis is modulated. 29.
