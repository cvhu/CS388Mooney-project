The present invention is a method of controlling a robotic mechanism comprising both active and passive joints, where the motion of one or more of the passive joints is constrained by one or more constraints imposed on the mechanism by the environment, the mechanical construction of the mechanism or the nature of the task. The method is capable of controlling mechanisms with multiple sets of passive joints with multiple environmental constraints restricting the motion of the mechanism. In a preferred embodiment the novel method is used to control a surgical robot holding a surgical instrument inserted into a patient through a natural or man-made orifice.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for controlling a robot comprising both active and passive joints constrained by an untouchable opening in an object, comprising steps of: quantifying constraints of an opening on said active joints and said passive joints; quantifying current positions of said active joints and said passive joints; quantifying an actual position of a target element using said current positions of said active joints and said passive joints; quantifying a desired position for said target element; calculating a Jacobian using said quantified constraints of the opening relating velocities in active joint space and passive joint space to velocities in Cartesian space for an incremental movement between said actual position and said desired position; and moving said active joints according to said Jacobian such that said opening is untouched.
