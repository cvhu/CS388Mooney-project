A method for automatically tracking the joint between a first component and a second component, or the edge of a component, a welding operation. A preliminary path is defined for the joint or edge (703), a welding torch (100) is moved along the preliminary path while an arc welding current is provided to the welding torch. The welding torch is moved slightly to a first side (705A) of the preliminary path and then to a second side (705B) of the preliminary path as the welding torch is being moved along the preliminary path. A first current measurement is obtained by measuring the arc welding current when the welding torch is to the first side, and a second current is obtained by measuring the arc welding current when the welding torch is to second side. The first current measurement and the second current measurement are compared and used to redefine the preliminary welding path by moving the welding torch slightly to the side having the preferred current measurement.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of automatically tracking the joint between a first component and a second component for performing a welding operation, comprising the steps of: defining a preliminary path for said joint; moving a welding torch along said preliminary path; providing an arc welding current to said welding torch; alternately moving said welding torch slightly to a first side of said preliminary path and to a second side of said preliminary path as said welding torch is being moved along said preliminary path; providing a first current measurement by measuring said arc welding current when said welding torch is to said first side; providing a second current measurement by measuring said arc welding current when said welding torch is to said second side; comparing said first current measurement and said second current measurement; and redefining said preliminary path by moving said welding torch slightly to the side of said preliminary path which provides the smaller of said current measurements. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said step of providing said first current measurement comprises providing a measurement of said arc welding current for each of a predetermined number of points, and summing said measurements for said predetermined number of points to provide a cumulative current measurement for said first current measurement. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said step of providing said first current measurement comprises providing a measurement of said arc welding current for each of a predetermined number of points, and averaging said measurements for said predetermined number of points to provide an average current measurement for said first current measurement. 4. A method of automatically tracking an edge of a component for performing a welding operation, comprising the steps of: defining a preliminary path along said edge; moving a welding torch along said preliminary path; providing an arc welding current to said welding torch; alternately moving said welding torch slightly to a first side of said preliminary path and to a second side of said preliminary path as said welding torch is being moved along said preliminary path; providing a first current measurement by measuring said arc welding current when said welding torch is to said first side; providing a second current measurement by measuring said arc welding current when said welding torch is to said second side; comparing said first current measurement and said second current measurement; and redefining said preliminary path by moving said welding torch slightly to the side of said preliminary path which provides the smaller of said current measurements. 5. The method of claim 4 wherein said step of providing said first current measurement comprises providing a measurement of said arc welding current for each of a predetermined number of points, and summing said measurements for said predetermined number of points to provide a cumulative current measurement for said first current measurement. 6. The method of claim 4 wherein said step of providing said first current measurement comprises providing a measurement of said arc welding current for each of a predetermined number of points, and averaging said measurements for said predetermined number of points to provide an average current measurement for said first current measurement. 7. An apparatus for automatically tracking a joint for a machine performing an operation along a path, said joint being along said path and being between a first component and a second component, said apparatus comprising: a first emitter for emitting a first signal toward said first component, said first signal having a first signal characteristic, said first emitter being oriented in a predetermined manner with respect to said joint; a second emitter for emitting a second signal toward said second component, said second signal having a second signal characteristic, said second emitter being oriented in a predetermined manner with respect to said joint; a first detector for detecting said first signal reflected by said first component and providing a first detected signal, said first detector being oriented in a predetermined manner with respect to said joint; a second detector for receiving said second signal reflected by said second component and providing a second detected signal, said second detector being oriented in a predetermined manner with respect to said joint; and means for comparing said first detected signal and said second detected signal to determine a location for said joint; and means for causing said machine to perform said operation on said joint by changing said path in accordance with said location. 8. A method of automatically tracking the joint between a first component and a second component for performing a welding operation, comprising the steps of: defining a weld type; defining a preliminary path for said joint; moving a welding torch along said preliminary path; providing an arc welding current to said welding torch; alternately moving said welding torch slightly to a first side of said preliminary path and to a second side of said preliminary path as said welding torch is being moved along said preliminary path; providing a first current measurement by measuring said arc welding current when said welding torch is to said first side; providing a second current measurement by measuring said arc welding current when said welding torch is to said second side; comparing said first current measurement and said second current measurement; and redefining said preliminary path by moving said welding torch slightly to the side of said preliminary path which provides the smaller of said current measurements if said weld type is a first weld type, and by moving said welding torch slightly to the side of said preliminary path which provides the larger of said current measurements if said weld type is a second weld type.
