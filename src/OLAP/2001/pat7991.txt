Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of ubiquitin protein ligases WWP1 and WWP2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding ubiquitin protein ligases WWP1 and WWP2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of ubiquitin protein ligases WWP1 and WWP2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of ubiquitin protein ligases WWP1 and WWP2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a ubiquitin protein ligase comprising ubiquitin protein ligase WWP1 (SEQ ID NO: 3) or ubiquitin protein ligase WWP2 (SEQ ID NO: 10), wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of the ubiquitin protein ligase (SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 10). 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 42, 43, 47, 48 or 50. 4. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, or 93. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length which specifically hybridizes with at least an 8-nucleobase portion of an active site on a nucleic acid molecule encoding a ubiquitin protein ligase comprising ubiquitin protein ligase WWP1 (SEQ ID NO: 3) or ubiquitin protein ligase WWP2 (SEQ ID NO: 10). 13. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 14. The composition of claim 13 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 15. The composition of claim 13 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 16. A method of inhibiting the expression of a ubiquitin protein ligase in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of ubiquitin protein ligase is inhibited.
