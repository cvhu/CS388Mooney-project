Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for inhibiting the expression of Her-3. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Her-3. Methods of using these compounds for inhibition of Her-3 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Her-3 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NOS: 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90, 92, 93 or 94 which inhibits the expression of human Her-3. 2. An antisense compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising SEQ ID NOS: 18 or 63 which inhibits the expression of human Her-3. 3. The antisense compound of claim 1 or claim 2 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Her-3 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 or 2 so that expression of human Here-3 is inhibited.
