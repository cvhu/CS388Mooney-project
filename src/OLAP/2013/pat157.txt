This invention provides fluidic devices, in particular microfluidic devices, with diaphragm valves having low failure rates. Low failure rates are achieved by inhibiting sticking of the diaphragm to functional surfaces such as valve seats, valve chamber and fluidic channels and conduits. One way to implement this is to provide exposed surfaces facing the diaphragm, particularly valve seats, with a low energy material, such as a noble metal, a perfluorinated polymer, a self-assembled monolayer, hard diamond, diamond-like carbon or a metal oxide. In other embodiments, the valves are provided with ridges and the diaphragm is adhered to the fluidic or actuation layer with an adhesive material.
