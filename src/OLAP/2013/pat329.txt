Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for biocatalytic synthesis of a structured lipid comprising the following steps: (a) providing a polypeptide having a palmitase activity, said polypeptide being selected from the group consisting of isolated, synthetic and recombinant polypeptides having a palmitase activity and said polypeptide either i. being encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein the nucleic acid encodes at least one polypeptide having palmitase activity and the polypeptide having at least one amino acid residue change recited below in Table A, or ii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and having at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A, TABLE-US-00014 TABLE A Amino Original New Acid Residue Amino Acid Amino Acid 27 G Q 45 G L 54 S H 61 D A E 62 V A G 72 R E K S T 74 F I 83 V M 96 A I 98 G L 116 E A F H L Q Q R, H140R R S S T V 117 L R, I161L 120 K L 133 S A 147 I F 151 I A G H 160 P T 172 R Q 212 S R 213 K T 214 T V N R Y 215 G A H 216 A V C L or iii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length of SEQ ID NO:2 and comprising at least one amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R (b) providing a composition comprising a triacylglyceride; (c) contacting the polypeptide of step (a) with the composition of step (b) under conditions wherein the polypeptide hydrolyzes a palmitic acid residue at the Sn1 or Sn3 position of the triacylglyceride, thereby producing a 1,2-diacylglyceride or 2,3-diacylglyceride; and (d) promoting acyl migration in the 1,2-diacylglyceride or 2,3-diacylglyceride of the step (c) under kinetically controlled conditions, thereby producing a 1,3-diacylglyceride. 2. The method of claim 1 comprising the further step of providing an R1 ester and an R1-specific lipase, and contacting the 1,3-diacylglyceride of step (d) with the R1 ester and the R1-specific lipase under conditions wherein the R1-specific lipase catalyzes esterification of the Sn2 position, thereby producing a structured lipid, wherein the R1 ester comprises a fatty acid of lower saturation than the hydrolyzed palmitic acid residue. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said R1-specific lipase is an Sn1 or an Sn3-specific lipase. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said structured lipid is selected from the group consisting of a cocoa butter alternative, a synthetic cocoa butter, a natural cocoa butter, 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol, 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoylglycerol, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoylglycerol or 1-oleoyl-2,3-dimyristoylglycerol. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein said R1 ester comprises one or more of an omega-3 fatty acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and a mono-unsaturated fatty acid. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein said R1 ester comprises a moiety selected from the group consisting of alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and palmitoleic acid diethylstilbestrol, and oryzanol. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein step (d) further comprises using ion exchange resins. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein said kinetically controlled conditions of step (d) comprise non-equilibrium conditions resulting in production of an end product having greater than a 2:1 ratio of 1,3-diacylglyceride to 2,3-diacylglyceride. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein said synthesized structured lipid has a lower saturated fat content than said triacylglyceride. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein said synthesized structured lipid has a lower trans fat content than said triacylglyceride. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and has at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A. 12. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2 and further comprises at least one of amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R. 13.
