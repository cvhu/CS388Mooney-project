Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for treating cancer, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an affinity reagent selected from the group consisting of a monoclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody fragment, which specifically binds to the matriptase stem located on the cell surface. 2. A method for treating cancer, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an affinity reagent selected from the group consisting of a monoclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody fragment, which specifically binds to the matriptase stem located on the cell surface, wherein the monoclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody fragment does not bind to the matriptase catalytic domain. 3. A method according to claim 1, wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer and uterine cancer. 4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13, or a sequence having 80% homology to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13, or a sequence having 90% homology to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13, or a sequence having 95% homology to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the affinity reagent contains or is conjugated to a therapeutic moiety. 9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the therapeutic moiety is a cytotoxic moiety or a radioactive moiety. 10. The method according to claim 9, wherein the therapeutic moiety is a cytotoxic moiety. 11. The method according to claim 1, wherein the affinity reagent is a monoclonal antibody. 12. The method according to claim 1, wherein the monoclonal antibody is a full-length antibody of an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 isotype. 13. The method according to claim 1, wherein the monoclonal antibody is selected from the group consisting of a humanised antibody, a single chain antibody, an immunoconjugate, a defucosylated antibody and a bispecific antibody. 14. The method according to claim 1, wherein the monoclonal antibody fragment is selected from the group consisting of a UniBody, a domain antibody and a Nanobody. 15. The method according to claim 11, wherein the monoclonal antibody has cytotoxicity against matriptase stem antigen expressing cells in the presence of a human complement. 16. The method according to claim 11, wherein the monoclonal antibody has cytotoxicity against matriptase stem antigen expressing cells in the presence of human immune effector cells. 17. A method according to claim 2, wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer and uterine cancer. 18. The method according to claim 2, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13, or a sequence having 80% homology to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 19. The method according to claim 18, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13, or a sequence having 90% homology to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 20. The method according to claim 19, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13, or a sequence having 95% homology to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 21. The method according to claim 20, wherein the matriptase stem has the amino acid sequence defined in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12 and 13. 22. The method according to claim 2, wherein the affinity reagent contains or is conjugated to a therapeutic moiety. 23. The method according to claim 22, wherein the therapeutic moiety is a cytotoxic moiety or a radioactive moiety. 24. The method according to claim 23, wherein the therapeutic moiety is a cytotoxic moiety. 25. The method according to claim 2, wherein the affinity reagent is a monoclonal antibody. 26. The method according to claim 2, wherein the monoclonal antibody is a full-length antibody of an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 isotype. 27. The method according to claim 2, wherein the monoclonal antibody is selected from the group consisting of a humanised antibody, a single chain antibody, an immunoconjugate, a defucosylated antibody and a bispecific antibody. 28. The method according to claim 2, wherein the monoclonal antibody fragment is selected from the group consisting of a UniBody, a domain antibody and a Nanobody. 29. The method according to claim 25, wherein the monoclonal antibody has cytotoxicity against matriptase stem antigen expressing cells in the presence of human complement. 30. The method according to claim 25, wherein the monoclonal antibody has cytotoxicity against matriptase stem antigen expressing cells in the presence of human immune effector cells.
