A system for managing a application includes a clock unit outputting time signals, a storage unit storing an age table, a detection unit and a resetting unit. The application includes a logical pointer and a flag carrying a flag bit. The age table includes ordered logical headers and age values, each logical header associated with an age value, the logical pointer pointing to one logical header, the age value having an increment as the logical pointer moves forward along the logical headers. The detection unit receives the time signals and reads the flag bit and moves the logical pointer to a succeeding logical header with a first step if the flag bit changes and with a second step if the flag bit remains unchanged during interval between two time signals. The second step is larger than the first step. The resetting unit resets the flag bit.
