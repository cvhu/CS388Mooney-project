Disclosed herein is a holder for biological sample containers such as well plates. The holder comprises a flat vacuum bed surrounded by a seal. A container is placed within the seal and a vacuum is applied, pressing and flattening the lower surface of the sample container against the flat vacuum bed. Samples in all portions of the container may then be imaged without the need to refocus on each portion of the container. For imaging, a sample in a well can be illuminated by a beam of light arranged so that a part or all of the sample is illuminated by direct rays that have not passed through the well plate. The beam is redirected to other parts of the well if a single illumination does not cover the whole well, so that the sample is imaged using a series of partial images.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Apparatus for imaging a biological sample in a well of a well plate, comprising: the well plate comprising the well defined by a side wall and a base and containing the sample therein; a holder operable to hold the well plate; an optical beam source generating a beam of light and comprising: a converging lens centered on a propagation axis of the beam of light and an aperture offset from the propagation axis; the beam source operable to direct the beam of light onto the base of the well via the converging lens and via the aperture passing therethrough a fraction of the beam that comprises light rays converging to a focus on the propagation axis, the focus positioned beyond the well, and the beam being defined, in a plane parallel to the propagation axis, by a first light ray parallel to the propagation axis, the first light ray directed substantially parallel to the side wall of the well, and a second light ray at an angle to the propagation axis so that a part of the base is illuminated by light rays in the beam incident on the base that have not first passed through a part of the well plate; the apparatus being operable to reposition the well plate held by the holder and the beam by rotating the aperture about the propagation axis by 90, 180 or 270 degrees to reposition the beam and by moving the holder holding the well plate to bring a further part or parts of the base into line with the repositioned beam, the part and the further part or parts together comprising the whole of the base; and an imaging camera operable to record an image of the biological sample each time the base is illuminated. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the fraction of the beam illuminates approximately one quadrant of the base with each rotation of the aperture about the propagation axis. 3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the aperture is crescent-shaped with the propagation axis located within the curve of the crescent but outside the aperture. 4. Apparatus for imaging a biological sample comprising: a well plate comprising a well containing the biological sample, the well defined by a side wall and a base; a holder operable to hold the well plate; an optical beam source operable to generate a beam of light directed onto the base of the well, the beam source comprising: a converging lens centered on a propagation axis of the beam of light; and a crescent-shaped aperture positioned offset from the propagation axis that is located within the curve of the crescent but outside the aperture, the aperture dimensioned to pass a fraction of the beam that illuminates a part of the base of the well approximately equal to one quadrant of the base, the beam comprising light rays converging to a focus on the propagation axis, the focus positioned beyond the well, and the beam being defined, in a plane parallel to the propagation axis, by a first light ray parallel to the propagation axis and a second light ray at an angle to the propagation axis; the beam being directed such that the first light ray is substantially parallel to the side wall of the well; the apparatus being operable to reposition the well plate held by the holder and/or beam to direct the beam onto a further part or parts of the base, the part and the further part or parts together comprising the whole of the base; and an imaging camera operable to record an image of the biological sample each time the base is illuminated. 5. The apparatus of claim 1 or 4, further comprising a controller operable to control the holder, the optical beam source and the imaging camera to: relatively reposition the holder, the optical beam source and the imaging camera for illuminating and imaging each of the part and the further part or parts of the base of each well in a well plate held by the holder; illuminate each of the part and the further part or parts; and record an image of each of the part and the further part or parts. 6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the controller is further operable to control the holder, the optical beam source and the imaging camera to: illuminate and record an image of a first part of each well; illuminate and record an image of a second part of each well; and if necessary repeat the illuminating and recording for further parts of each well until every part of each well has been illuminated and imaged. 7. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the holder is operable to hold a well plate comprising an array of wells arranged in wells, and the controller is further operable to control the holder, the optical beam source and the imaging camera to: illuminate and record an image of a first part of each well in a first row; illuminate and record an image of a second part of each well in the first row; if necessary repeat the illuminating and recording for further parts of each well in the first row until every part of each well in the first row has been illuminated and imaged; illuminate and record an image of a first part of each well in a second row; illuminate and record an image of a second part of each well in the second row; if necessary repeat the illuminating and recording for further parts of each well in the second row until every part of each well in the first row has been illuminated and imaged; and repeat the illuminating and recording for each further row in the well plate. 8. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the holder is operable to hold a well plate comprising an array of wells arranged in rows, the optical beam source is operable to illuminate a quadrant of the base, and the controller is further operable to control the holder, the optical beam source and the imaging camera to: illuminate and record an image of a first quadrant of each well in a first row in a consecutive sequence in a first direction along the row; reposition the well plate and/or the beam to illuminate a second quadrant of each well; illuminate and record an image of the second quadrant of each well in the first row in a consecutive sequence in a second direction along the row opposite to the first direction; reposition the well plate and/or the beam to illuminate a third quadrant of each well; illuminate and record an image of the third quadrant of each well in the first row in a consecutive sequence in the first direction along the row; reposition the well and/or the beam to illuminate a fourth quadrant of each well; illuminate and record an image of the fourth quadrant of each well in the first row in a consecutive sequence in the second direction; and repeat the illuminating and recording for each further row in the well plate.
