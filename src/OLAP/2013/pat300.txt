Therapeutic agents for treatment of Galactosemia and disorders thereof, and other enzyme related disorders thereof are identified. The compounds inhibit galactokinase (GALK) and other kinase activity and are identified by a high throughput screening assay.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inhibiting galactokinase (GALK) in a cell, comprising: administering to a cell, a composition comprising at least one agent selected from the group consisting of: ##STR00008## ##STR00009## ##STR00010## ##STR00011## ##STR00012## ##STR00013## ##STR00014## ##STR00015## in a therapeutically effective amount for decreasing gal-1-p levels in the cell and inhibiting GALK in the cell. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one agent is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR00016## ##STR00017## 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one agent is ##STR00018## 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one agent is ##STR00019##
