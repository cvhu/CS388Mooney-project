A plurality of spring clips (30), each having an elongated central member (32) with first (40) and second (38) ends and a plurality of resilient arms (36) radially extending therefrom, are simultaneously transferred between a transfer plate (90) and a pallet (20). The first ends (40) of the member (32) are lockably engaged in the transfer plate (90) with the second ends (38) thereof positioned into apertures (24) in the pallet (20). The central member (32) is rotated to release the first ends (40) from the transfer plate (90) while simultaneously lockably engaging the second ends (38) to the pallet (20) to secure the clips (30) therein and to capture a chip carrier (10) between the ends of each arm (36) and the pallet (20).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of assembling a plurality of semiconductor chip carriers comprising the steps of: (a) conveying a pallet having a plurality of cavities and receiving passages therein; (b) loading each of a plurality of planar chip carrier lids, having a reflowable bonding material deposited on a major surface thereof, into each of the cavities of the pallet; (c) depositing each of a plurality of chip carrier cases into the cavities to overlie the lids therein with the bonding material therebetween; (d) lockably inserting each of a plurality of spring clips, having an elongated central member with first and second ends and a plurality of resilient arms extending radially therefrom, simultaneously into a corresponding one of a plurality of receiving passages of the pallet such that each of the arms of the spring clips bear against a corresponding one of the cases situated in the cavities surrounding the passages to urge the cases into intimate contact with the associated underlying lids, with the bonding material therebetween; (e) heating the chip carrier cases and lids so as to reflow the bonding material between each case and lid to form hermetically-sealed chip carriers upon subsequent cooling; (f) simultaneously removing the spring clips from the receiving passages of the pallet; and (g) removing the chip carriers from the pallet. 2. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the lockably inserting step comprises: (a) positioning a transfer plate and a plurality of spring clips having first ends of the central members lockably engaged therein so that the second end of each central member of the spring clips is in registration with a corresponding receiving passage in the pallet; (b) moving the transfer plate so that the second end of each central member is positioned into the corresponding receiving passage in the pallet; (c) positioning a plurality of ratchets with rotatable first ends so that the first end of each ratchet is in registration with the first end of the central member of a corresponding spring clip; (d) moving the ratchets so that the first end of each ratchet engages the first end of the central member of the corresponding spring clip; (e) rotating the first ends of the ratchets for rotating each spring clip engaged thereto so that the first ends of the central members simultaneously disengage the transfer plate and the second ends of the central members lockably engage the receiving passage in the pallet; and (f) moving the ratchets and the transfer plate away from the pallet so that the first end of each central member slidably releases from the first end of the corresponding ratchet and the transfer plate. 3. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the removing step comprises: (a) positioning a transfer plate, adapted to engage the first ends of the central members having second ends engaged in the receiving passages of the pallet, so that the first end of each central member engaged by the pallet is in registration with the plate; (b) moving the transfer plate so that the first end of each central member is positioned within openings in the transfer plate; (c) positioning a plurality of ratchets with rotatable first ends so that the first end of each ratchet is in registration with the first end of the central member of a corresponding spring clip; (d) moving the ratchets so that each first end of each ratchet engages the first end of the central member of the corresponding spring clip while each spring clip is still engaged in the transfer plate; (e) rotating the first ends of the ratchets which, in turn, simultaneously rotate each spring clip engaged thereto so that the second ends of the central members simultaneously disengage the receiving passages in the pallet and the first ends of the central members lockably engage the transfer plate; and (f) moving the ratchets and the transfer plate away from the pallet so that the first ends of each central member slidably release from the first end of the corresponding ratchet and the second end of each elongated central member releases from the passages in the pallet.
