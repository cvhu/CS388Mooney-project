A fully automated residential-type circuit breaker assembly is made possible by the provision of retaining slots and guide channels formed within the breaker case. The breaker case then serves as an assembly fixture for specially designed armatures and magnets used within the trip section of the breaker as well as for a special designed bi-metallic trip element. A high calibration yield is accomplished by means of a low friction latch assembly.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for automatically assembling a circuit breaker assembly within a molded plastic circuit breaker case having a plurality of retaining slots and guide channels integrally formed within the case comprising the steps of: inserting an armature containing a latch opening within a first one of said retaining slots within said case; positioning a contact blade and trip unit assembly over said armature within said case; inserting a magnetic core over said trip unit and said armature and positioning a hook extension on said magnetic core over a shelf portion on said armature; positioning a handle member within a second one of said retaining slots within said case; inserting a two legged U-shaped cradle member having a circular end member at an end of one of the legs and a latch portion at an end of the other of the legs and positioning the circular end member over a pivot formed within said case and positioning said latch portion in operative relation to said armature latch opening; arranging a mechanism spring, having a closed loop eye at both ends, between said cradle and said contact blade by engaging one of said spring eyes over a spring tab on said contact blade and engaging the other of said spring eyes over a spring tab on said cradle; inserting a latch spring within a third one of said retaining slots within said case proximate a top end of said armature; positioning an arc chute and fixed contact within a fourth recess formed in said case in operational relationship with said contact blade; and fastening a molded plastic cover having a corresponding plurality of slots formed therein over said case whereby said slots formed in said cover cooperate with said slots formed in said case to provide operational clearance for said circuit breaker assembly.
