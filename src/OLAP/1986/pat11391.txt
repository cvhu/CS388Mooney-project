A load plate is rigidly supported by a central pedestal strain gaged for bending about a central axis. In one embodiment, the pedestal is mounted to the center of a yoke bar supported by two legs strain gaged for comprehensive loads only the sum of which is indicative of the magnitude of the plate load. The legs are supported by base webs strain gaged for bending about a central axis orthogonal to the axis of pedestal bending. The output of the bending strain gages enables determination of the coordinates of the load location on the plate from the central axis axes. In a second embodiment, the pedestal is supported by a block rigidly attached to the end of a cantilevered member extending at right angles from the pedestal. The cantilever member is strain gaged at two longitudinal stations for reading the differential of the bending strain to thereby determine the shear loading, or plate tactile load. One of the coordinates of the applied load on the plate is determined from the output of the pedestal bending strain gages and the other coordinate from one of these bending strain gage sets on the cantilever member. An optional bellow over the cantilever member provides in reared torsional stiffness without decreasing bending sensitivity.
