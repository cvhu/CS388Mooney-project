A baseplate carries an axially-advanceable rotating cutter. A V-block and clamp head are aligned on the plate to locate and secure a robot-positioned welding torch nozzle in a vertical attitude. After clamping the nozzle in position, the rotating cutter is advanced into the nozzle bore to remove accumulated internal weld spatter. The machined-away weld spatter can therefore be discharged under the influence of gravity or by a blast of purging air applied to the torch nozzle.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automatic welding torch cleaner, comprising: a base; a relatively rigid cutter rotatably carried on said base; means for rotating said cutter; means for reversibly moving said cutter along its axis of rotation on said base between advanced and retracted positions; means, mounted on said base, for linearly guiding said cutter while reversibly moving and for aligning said axis of rotation in a subtantially vertical attitude; and means, mounted on said base above said cutter in its retracted position, for aligning a welding torch coaxially with said cutter and for clamping said welding torch stationarily on said base with respect to said cutter. 2. The torch cleaners of claim 1, wherein said cutter has an axial hole interconnected to a radial hole to create a chip removal path from the bore of said welding torch as said cutter is in contact with said torch.
