Chip carrier socket 2 comprises a socket body 24 having a rectangular base 30 and walls 34 extending normally from the edges 32 of the base. The walls can be pivotally moved inwardly of the recess which is defined by the walls after a chip carrier 12 has been placed in the recess. A frame 28 is provided in surrounding relationship to the walls 34 and is movable relative thereto between a first position and a second position. When the frame 28 is moved to the second position, the walls 34 are moved inwardly thereby to move the contact terminals 26 in the walls against terminal pads 20 on the leadless chip carrier 12. The frame 28 also may have an ejector means integral therewith which will eject the chip carrier from the socket when the frame is moved from a second position to the first position. The frame may also cam the walls outwardly to permit placement of the chip carrier in the recess under ZIF conditions.
