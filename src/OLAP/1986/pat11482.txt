Method and apparatus are disclosed using a robot to load and unload precut pieces of sheet molding compound and the like between an upper die and a lower die of a sheet molding press. The steps in the method include having the robot ready and hold a raw piece while the press is closed and molding a piece already therein, opening the press on completion of molding the piece therein and suspending such molded piece independent of the robot in a predetermined intermediate position between the dies as the press opens, provided such molded piece does not stick to the upper die, having the robot enter the raw piece into the press between the molded piece and the lower die, having the robot sense the presence of the molded piece in the suspended position and in that event secure same thereto, or if not so present and stuck in the upper die then withdraw the raw piece from the press, and having the robot with the securing thereto of the molded piece only then unload the raw piece on the lower die and retract the molded piece from between the dies for subsequent press molding of the thus loaded raw piece.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method of using a robot to load and unload precut pieces of sheet molding compound and the like between an upper die and a lower die of a sheet molding press comprising the steps of: having the robot ready and hold a raw piece while the press is closed and molding a piece already therein, opening the press on completion of molding the piece therein and suspending such molded piece independent of the robot in a predetermined intermediate position between the dies as the press opens, provided such molded piece does not stick to the upper die, having the robot enter the raw piece into the press between the molded piece and the lower die, having the robot sense the presence of the molded piece in the suspended position and in that event secure same thereto, and if not so present and stuck in the upper die then withdraw the raw piece from the press, and having the robot with the securing thereto of the molded piece only then unload the raw piece on the lower die and retract the molded piece from between the dies for subsequent press molding of the thus loaded raw piece. 2. A method of using a robot to load and unload precut pieces of sheet molding compound and the like between an upper die and a lower die of a sheet molding press comprising the steps of: having the robot ready and hold a raw piece while the press is closed and molding a piece already therein, opening the press on completion of molding the piece therein and suspending such molded piece from the upper die in a predetermined intermediate position between the dies as the press opens, provided such molded piece does not stick to the upper die, having the robot enter the raw piece into the press between the molded piece and the lower die, having the robot sense the presence of the molded piece in the suspended position and in that event secure same thereto, and if not so present and stuck in the upper die attempt retrieval but if unsuccessful, then withdraw the raw piece from the press, and having the robot with the securing thereto of the molded piece only then unload the raw piece on the lower die and retract the molded piece from between the dies for subsequent press molding of the thus loaded raw piece. 3. Apparatus for using a robot to load and unload precut pieces of sheet molding compound and the like between an upper die and a lower die of a sheet molding press characterized by: end effector means for readying and holding a raw piece on the robot while the press is closed and molding a piece already therein, suspender means for suspending such molded piece independent of the robot in a predetermined intermediate position between the dies as the press opens, provided such molded piece does not stick to the upper die, means for causing the end effector means to enter the raw piece into the press between the molded piece and the lower die, means on said end effector means for selectively sensing the presence of the molded piece in the suspended position and in that event to secure the molded piece to said effector means and, if not so present and stuck in the upper die then withdraw the raw piece from the press, and means for causing the end effector means with the securing thereto of the molded piece to only then unload the raw piece on the lower die and retract the molded piece from between the dies for subsequent press molding of the thus loaded raw piece. 4. Apparatus for using a robot to load and unload precut pieces of sheet molding compound and the like between an upper die and a lower die of a sheet molding press characterized by: end effector means including releasable suction devices for readying and holding a raw piece on an arm of the robot while the press is closed and molding a piece already therein, suspender means on the upper die for releasably suspending such molded piece in a predetermined intermediate position between the dies as the press opens, means for causing the end effector means to enter the raw piece into the press between the molded piece and the lower die, said end effector means further including limit switches for sensing the presence of the molded piece in the suspended position and also including additional releasable suction devices for securing same thereto, and means for causing the end effector means with the securing thereto of the molded piece to only then unload the raw piece on the lower die and retract the molded piece from between the dies for subsequent press molding of the thus loaded raw piece.
