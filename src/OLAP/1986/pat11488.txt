A carrier conveyor system wherein carriers are disengaged from the main conveyor in advance of a work station and re-engaged beyond the work station and a transfer conveyor is positioned such that it receives the carriers as they are disengaged, transfers them as required to the work station, removes them from the work station after the work is performed and returns them to the main conveyor. The transfer conveyor comprises a plurality of transfer assemblies positioned along each side of the path of the carriers from the area where the carriers are disengaged from the conveyor through the work station and to the area where the carriers are re-engaged with the conveyor. Each transfer assembly comprises a plurality of longitudinally spaced wheels mounted with their axes transverse to the path of the carriers. The rollers are driven continuously when it is desired such that the carrier is moved by each transfer assembly to the succeeding transfer assembly or position. The number of transfer assemblies is such that there will be sufficient time at the work station to perform the function desired and at the same time there will always be a carrier ready for re-engagement with the conveyor thereby insuring that there will be a carrier at each longitudinally spaced drive position on the main conveyor in the remainder of the conveyor system.
