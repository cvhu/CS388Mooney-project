A circuit breaker panelboard modular assembly employs a plurality of interdependent molded plastic and metal parts to multifunctionally adapt breakers of different ratings for electrical connection within the panelboard enclosure. Anti-turn connector connects the line strap terminal. Captive bolts or plug-in connections are employed to attach the breakers to the power bus. A novel concealed hinge construction is used to connect the panelboard door to the panelboard housing and the breakers are individually identified within the housing by extruded plastic circuit markers.
Claims Having described our invention, what we claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent is: 1. A circuit breaker panelboard assembly comprising: closure means housing at least one main circuit breaker or at least one main wire terminal lug and a plurality of branch circuit breakers; access means movably arranged on said closure means providing access to said main and said branch circuit breakers from outside of said closure; mounting means within said closure supporting said branch circuit breakers and providing electrical connection between said branch circuit breakers and electrical bus bars connectable with an external circuit; and shield means intermediate said access means and said main and branch circuit breakers preventing contact with electrical terminals on said main and branch circuit breakers; said access means comprising a metal or plastic face plate encompassing an opening defined through said face plate and a door arranged within said opening and supported therein by at least one hinge, said hinge being formed from a single piece of metal having an L-shaped end and a cylindrical end, said L-shaped end being welded to said door and said cylindrical end encompassing a pin captured within a rabbet member, said rabbet member being welded to said face plate. 2. A circuit breaker panelboard assembly comprising: closure means housing at least one main circuit breaker and a plurality of branch circuit breakers; access means movably arranged on said closure means providing access to said main and said branch circuit breakers from outside of said closure; mounting means within said closure supporting said branch circuit breakers and providing electrical connection between said branch circuit breakers and electrical bus bars connectable with an external circuit; shield means intermediate said access means and said main and branch circuit breakers preventing contact with electrical terminals on said main and branch circuit breakers; and said access means comprising a metal or plastic face plate encompassing an opening defined through said face plate and a door arranged within said opening and supported therein by at least one hinge, said hinge being formed from a single piece of metal having an L-shaped end and a cylindrical end, said L-shaped end being welded to said door and said cylindrical end encompassing a pin captured within a rabbet member, said rabbet member being welded to said face plate; whereby said cylindrical end rotatably encompasses said pin having ends extending from both ends of said cylindrical end and said rabbet includes an opening through which a major portion of said hinge extends, said rabbet further including a pair of semiconductor protrusions formed opposite said pin ends, said semicircular protrusions trapping said pins ends between said rabbet and said face plate.
