A robot "touches off" on the orthagonal touchblock faces of a workpiece holding fixture and the coordinate of the touches along axes nominally normal to the faces provide significant data from which a coordinate transformation indicative of the orientation and location of the touchblocks in the robot frame of reference can be determined. The coordinate transformation is subsequently applied to workpiece coordinates indicative of the location and orientation of the workpiece and/or points thereon.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of determining a coordinate transformation indicative of the rotation and origin offset of a touchblock frame of reference from a robot frame of reference, wherein the touchblock frame of reference is associated with a workpiece mounted to a fixture and is defined by three orthogonal unit vectors (x,y, and z), and wherein the robot frame of reference is associated with a robot and has three orthogonal axes--an x-axis, a y-axis, and a z-axis, comprising: providing a first touchblock (43) on the fixture having a first face (1) substantially normal to the robot x-axis, a second face (4) substantially normal to the robot y-axis, and a third face (6) substantially normal to the robot z-axis; providing a second touchblock (46) on the fixture having a fourth face (2) coplanar to the first face (1), and a fifth face (5) coplanar to the second face (4); providing a third touchblock (44) on the fixture having a sixth face (3) coplanar to the first (1) and fourth (2) faces; storing nominal coordinates in the robot frame of reference for the six faces (1-6) indicative of the approximate location of the fixture relative to the robot; automatically positioning the touchprobe in response to the stored nominal coordinates for the first face (1) to measure the actual location of the first face in the robot frame of reference, and storing a measured x-axis coordinate for the measured location of the first face; automatically positioning the touchprobe in response to the stored nominal coordinates for the fourth face (2) to measure the actual location of the fourth face in the robot frame of reference, and storing a measured x-axis coordinate for the measured location of the fourth face; automatically positioning the touchprobe in response to the stored nominal coordinates for the sixth face (3) to measure the actual location of the sixth face in the robot frame of reference, and storing a measured x-axis coordinate for the measured location of the sixth face; automatically positioning the touchprobe in response to the stored nominal coordinates for the second face (4) to measure the actual location of the second face in the robot frame of reference, and storing a measured y-axis coordinate for the measured location of the second face; automatically positioning the touchprobe in response to the stored nominal coordinates for the fifth face (5) to measure the actual location of the fifth face in the robot frame of reference, and storing a measured y-axis coordinate for the measured location of the fifth face; automatically positioning the touchprobe in response to the stored nominal coordinates for the third face (6) to measure the actual location of the third face in the robot frame of reference, and storing a measured z-axis coordinate for the measured location of the third face; calculating a first vector (V.sub.1,2) based on the measured x-axis coordinates for the measured location of the first (1) and fourth (2) faces; calculating a second vector (V.sub.1,3) based on the measured x-axis coordinates for the measured location of the first (1) and sixth (3) faces; calculating the x unit vector for the touchblock frame of reference by taking the crossproduct of the first and second vectors; calculating a third vector (V.sub.4,5) based on the measured y-axis coordinates for the measured location of the second (4) and fifth (5) faces; calculating the y unit vector for the touchblock frame of reference by taking the crossproduct of the calculated x unit vector and the third vector; calculating the z unit vector for the touchblock frame of reference by taking the crossproduct of the calculated x unit vector and the calculated y unit vector; determining a rotation matrix indicative of the rotation of the touchblock frame of reference relative to the robot frame of reference based on the calculated x, y, and z unit vectors for the touchblock frame of reference; determining an offset vector indicative of the offset of origins between the touchblock frame of reference and the robot frame of reference based on the measured x-axis coordinate of the first face, the measured y-axis coordinate for the second face, and the measured z-axis coordinate for the third face; and determining the coordinate transformation based on the rotation matrix and the offset vector.
