A robotic tractor that travels on rails forming a grid over a crop field and automatically performs tasks in the field is described. The tractor is supported on extendable legs that carry dual tandem perpendicular wheel sets. A rotary implement bed supported by the tractor is adapted to carry implements.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A robotic agricultural assembly comprising: rail tracks with means on the bottom of said tracks for suspending said tracks above substantially the entire area of a crop field, said tracks being straight and parallel over their length and defining parallel rows; a first pair of spaced apart, parallel tracks perpendicular to said rail tracks and having substantially the same elevation as said rail tracks and defining a first end margin of said parallel rows; a second pair of spaced apart, parallel tracks perpendicular to said rail tracks and having substantially the same elevation as said rail tracks and defining a second end margin of said parallel rows; a robot tractor positioned on said tracks and adapted to reciprocally travel over the rail tracks and switch between adjacent pairs of said rail tracks by moving over said perpendicular tracks at the end of each row defined by said rail tracks; said tractor including a carriage frame having a leg suspended from each corner thereof, each of said legs comprising an upper portion fixed to the carriage frame and a lower moveable portion, elevating means attached to and cooperating with said upper and lower leg portions to expand and contract the length of the tractor legs whereby said carriage frame height can be varied, each of said tractor legs having a first set of tandem wheels attached to a bottom portion of the lower leg portion and which travel over said rail tracks and a second set of tandem wheels perpendicular and criss-cross to said first set of wheels and which travel over said perpendicular tracks to reach an adjacent pair of said rail tracks when said tractor reaches the end of one row defined by said rail tracks; said second set of tandem wheels being retracted when said tractor is riding over said rail tracks; said first set of tandem wheels being retracted when said tractor is riding over said perpendicular end tracks; said wheels having flanges for travel over said tracks; said tracks comprising uniform length units of straight track and perpendicular crosses of intersectional track having depressions at their intersections of sufficient length that when the tractor tandem wheels meet one of the depressions during travel, one of said tandem wheels is in said one of said depressions while the other wheel is supported by the tracks, thereby avoiding interrupted horizontal movement as each wheel crosses said track intersection. 2. A robotic agricultural assembly according to claim 1 wherein said tractor carriage frame is substantially rectangular and supports a rotary table axially carried in a center portion of said frame, said table having agricultural mounting means carried on the underside of said table and below said frame and an implement useable to tend said field is attached and rotatably carried on said mounting means. 3. A robotic agricultural assembly of claim 2 wherein said rotary table comprises a horizontal top plate supported on said carriage frame and positioned above the carriage frame, a horizontal integral mounting plate attached to said top plate and having an opening at its center and positioned below said frame, and a perpendicular shaft rotatable on its vertical axis centered through said rotary table and cooperating therewith to drive said rotary table. 4. An agricultural mechanized system comprising the assembly of claim 1 wherein said tractor includes drive means for rotating the sets of tandem wheels and thereby independently powering said tractor. 5. A robotic agricultural system for automatically tending an agricultural field comprising: an array of straight, parallel row rail sections adapted to extend the entire length of a crop field to be tended, said rail sections including parallel tracks spaced apart so as to form tracks suitable for supporting and transporting a tractor positioned thereon, said parallel tracks defining rows; a first pair of straight, parallel, spaced apart crossrow rail sections perpendicular to said row rail sections, said perpendicular rail sections defining a first end of said rows; a second pair of straight, parallel, spaced apart crossrow rail sections perpendicular to said row rail sections defining a second end of said rows; said first and second perpendicular rail sections defining the length of said rows and having crossrow tracks substantially the same elevation as the row tracks and forming crossings with them; a tractor supported on said tracks and adapted to reciprocally travel back and forth across said field, said tractor comprising: (1) a substantially rectangular carriage frame, said frame having a top cover and four spaced corners; (2) each corner having an upper leg portion extending downwardly from said frame to a lower mating leg portion which telescopes within said upper leg portion to alter the height of said tractor frame; (3) dual conversion wheel assemblies affixed to the bottom end of said lower leg portions and positioned on said tracks, said wheel assemblies comprising perpendicularly criss-crossed pairs of tandem wheels, a first pair adapted for travel on said row tracks and a second pair adapted for travel on said crossrow tracks, one pair being suspended in space when the other pair is in contact with said tracks; (4) a rotary table mounted through said carriage frame having an integral implement mount at a lower portion thereof; and (5) means for powering said tractor and said implements.
