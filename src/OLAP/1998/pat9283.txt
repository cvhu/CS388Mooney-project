An automated order picking system assembled from known, available components and that includes a manager computer to receive orders for goods from a customer and to break the order down into requested full pallets of multiple ordered layers of goods; layers of goods ordered by the customer; compatible ordered layers of goods that can be combined into full pallets; and compatible cases of ordered goods that can be formed into layers and into full pallets of multiple layers of goods; and vertical cells for receiving, storing and delivering cases of the goods. The vertical cells comprise towers having mutually facing tower sections that receive goods delivered to feed conveyors by gantry robots having end effectors capable of handling the goods and the tower sections passing the goods back and forth as the goods are moved downwardly for placement on the discharge conveyor under the control of a programmable logic computer. The full pallets, full layers and cases of goods are conveyed to a palletizer to be organized into the requested orders.
