Plastic injection-compression multi-cavity molding of flash-free improved-cleanliness thermoplastic spectacle lenses (16) are suitable to be robotically dip hardcoated. Special spring-loaded (25, 26) molds having variable-volume mold cavities are used in an injection-compression molding process to form, without parting line flash, pairs of a wide range of differing optical power of polycarbonate Rx spectacle lenses (16). These pairs have special molded-on design features which are specially suited for full automation, starting with a novel way for ejection out of the mold into a takeout robot which is integrated via full automation with subsequent dip hardcoating. A molded-on tab with each pair of lenses is specially suited for manipulation by SCARA type robot. This combination produces micro-clean hardcoated paired molded lens made entirely within a single continuous cleanroom air enclosure surrounding the lenses, without any human operators therein, nor requiring any cutting or trimming of the molded paired lens or runner system before hardcoating, nor use of Freon (tm) CFC nor aqueous cleaning protocols before dipcoating.
Claims We claim: 1. An injection-compression molding process for reduced parting line flash on at least one molded thermoplastic article, within a moldset mounted within an injection molding machine having programmable control of means for applying clamping forces and opening forces onto a parting line formed between an A side and an B side of said moldset, and the injection molding machine having programmable control of means for moving forward or back an ejector assembly within the B side of said moldset using said moldset having at least one edge-gated variable-volume mold cavity, said mold cavity having partforming surfaces on opposing paired A side insert and B side insert facing the parting line, wherein at least one extendable and compressible passive resilient member of varying length which determines a cavity height dimension of said mold cavity within preset mechanical limits, the resilient member being an operative combination of i) steel coil die spring to provide a moderate spring force over a long distance in a first clamping position of said moldset, with ii) stacked Belleville steel spring washers to provide a stiff spring force over a short distance in a second clamping position of said moldset, the resilient member being mounted between a side parting line mold plate and B side clamp plate of said moldset and exerting combined spring forces to bias forward the B side parting line mold plate toward the parting line, such that when there is less clamping force exerted by the injection molding machine than a first spring force equal to the steel coil die spring force acting alone to bias forward the B side parting line mold plate toward the parting line, the resilient member length will be a maximum within the preset mechanical limits in the first clamping position of said moldset, and when there is more clamping force than the first spring force equal to the steel coil die spring force acting alone to bias forward toward the parting line but less clamping force than a second spring force equal to the steel coil die spring acting together with steel spring washer force to bias forward the B side parting line mold plate toward the parting line, the resilient member length will be an intermediate value in a second clamping position of said moldset, and when there is more clamping force than the second spring force equal to the steel coil die spring acting together with steel spring washer force to bias forward the B side parting line mold plate toward the parting line, the resilient member length will be a minimum within the preset mechanical limits in a third clamping position of said moldset, the process comprising the steps of: a.) Pre-enlarging said mold cavity by substantially closing a perimeter of said mold cavity at the parting line so as to prevent molten thermoplastic from flashing, in the first clamping position of said moldset, such that a first cavity height equal to the sum of the desired compression strokelength plus a final thickness of the molded article is determined, before injection starts b.) Partially filling said mold cavity after injection has started by progressively reducing cavity height to the second clamping position, by increasing clamp force applied to exceed the first spring force but less than the second spring force; c.) Completely filling said mold cavity by further progressively reducing cavity height to reach the third clamping position of said moldset, by increasing clamp force applied to exceed the second spring force; d.) Cooling said molded article within said mold cavity until the thermoplastic is shape stable, by maintaining cavity height substantially at the third clamping position of said moldset; e.) Ejecting said molded article by releasing clamp force and opening the moldset along the parting line. 2. An injection-compression molding process of claim 1 wherein said edge gated variable volume mold cavity is in fluid communication with a nozzle of the injection molding machine so as to form at least a cold sprue and gate having a B side mechanical retention, and said molded article has a perimeter edge having a drafted surface suited for clean release from a bore of said mold cavity, and ejecting said molded article by releasing clamp force and opening the moldset along the parting line comprises the steps of: e.) extending the resilient member while decreasing clamp force applied to less than the first spring force, thereby separating said molded article from the partforming surface of B side insert and creating a release space, before the parting line formed between A side and B side separates f.) pulling said molded article off the partforming surface of the A side insert as the parting line begins to separate, while mechanically retaining said molded article onto the B side; g.) stripping said molded article off the B side mechanical retention, once the moldset is fully open along the parting line. 3. An injection-compression molding process of claim 1 wherein stripping said molded article off the B side mechanical retention, once the moldset is fully open along the parting line but only after an end-of-arm tooling of a takeout robot is in place to receive said molded article.
