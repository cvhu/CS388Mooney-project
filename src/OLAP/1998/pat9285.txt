A stack tube type feeder is designed to be versatile to dispense a variety of parts. The part dependent components of the feeder can be either selectively interchanged or adjusted to accommodate a wider variety of parts. Specifically, a part feeder includes a tube guide assembly for holding a plurality of part supply tubes. Within the tube guide assembly removable front and rear stops prevent longitudinal movement of the part supply tube in the feed position. Included is a removably mounted guide track element having a guide track as part of the feed guide path. The changeover mechanism of the present invention includes removable front and rear tube supports for supporting the part supply tube in the feed position, and removable and adjustable front and rear singulator elements for supporting a next fed tube in a staging position. Preferably, a pusher mechanism includes a pusher tape and pusher element which are driven to advance the parts from the part supply tubes. Both are preferably replaceable and/or reorientable. Another aspect of the present invention is to provide the replaceable parts in kit form so that a part feeder in accordance with the present invention can be easily modified to accommodate a variety of components or parts.
