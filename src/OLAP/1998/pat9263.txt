An industrial resistance welding workcell includes a robot controller and robot, a welding control, and an overall workcell control in a form of a programmable logic controller and electronically-controlled electrically-actuator assembly is coupled to the wrist of a robot arm, which is further coupled to a conventional welding gun. The actuator assembly is controlled by an actuator control to vary the tip separation distance to any one of a virtually infinite number of separation distances, and further, is adapted to control a clamping force with a high degree of accuracy. The workcell further includes a tool used to secure a workpiece or workpieces. The tools characterized by use of an electronically-controlled electrically-actuated clamp for securing the position of the workpiece or workpieces relative to the base of the tool. Use of electrically-actuated clamps, and actuator assembly for the weld gun eliminates the need for use of plant-provided facilities, particularly compressed air and the dense packs, surge tanks, and air cylinders associated therewith as used in conventional resistance welding workcells. Furthermore, the workcell has associated therewith a self-contained closed loop cooling system, mounted under the robot base, that substantially eliminates the host of feed and return cooling hoses that are commonly found on conventional resistance well workcells. The all-electric workcell significantly reduces workcell down time, and material and labor cost, while improving overall system performance.
Claims We claim: 1. An apparatus for securing a workpiece using a control signal comprising: a base adapted to receive the workpiece; first electrically-actuated clamp connected to said base and responsive to said control signal for fixing the workpiece in a predetermined position relative to said base, the apparatus further comprising a second electrically-actuated clamp, wherein said control signal includes an address portion and each clamp has associated therewith address detection means responsive to said control signal for detecting an address and for fixing, in response thereto, the workpiece in a predetermined position relative to said base.
