A data processing system is provided that consists of a connection of a first neural network (N.sub.1) with at least one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n). The first neural network (N.sub.1) and the at least one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n) is an associative memory. First input data (E.sub.0) are supplied to both the first neural network (N.sub.1) and also to at least the one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n) Data (E.sub.11, E.sub.12, . . . , E.sub.1n) which are evaluated by at least the one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n), are supplied as further input data (E.sub.1) to the first neural network (N.sub.1).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A data processing system consisting of a connection of a first neural network (N.sub.1) with at least one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n), in which the first neural network (N.sub.1) and the at least one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n) is an associative memory, in which first input data (E.sub.0) are supplied to both the first neural network (N.sub.1) and also to at least the one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n) , where data (E.sub.11, E.sub.12, . . . E.sub.1n), which are evaluated by at least the one other neural network (N.sub.21, N.sub.22, . . . , N.sub.2n), are supplied as further input data (E.sub.1) to the first neural network (N.sub.1), wherein the data processing system is used as an optical switch. 2. A system according to claim 1, in which the respective evaluated data (E.sub.11, E.sub.12, . . ., E.sub.1n) are supplied to a decision element (S), which determines, with the aid of control information (I) supplied to the decision element, which of the respective evaluated data are supplied to the first neural network (N.sub.1). 3. A system according to claim 2, in which the decision element (S) calculates the data (E) to be supplied to the first neural network (N.sub.1) from the respective evaluated data (E.sub.11, E.sub.12, . . . , E.sub.1n).
