An automated system for individual dosage medication distribution 10 is provided. The system 10 includes a medium rate dispenser 20, a fast rate dispenser 30, a low rate dispenser 40, a conveyor 50, a diverter 60, a bagger 70, and collection bins 80 and 85. The dispensers 20, 30, and 40 are arranged to be able to deliver individual dosage packages of drugs to the conveyor 50. The conveyor 50, in turn, is configured to transport individual dosage packages to the bagger 70 or the collection bin 85. A programmable controller 12 receives patient prescription order information from health care providers and directs the dispensers 20, 30, and 40, conveyor 50, diverter 60, and bagger 70 to automatically pick the prescribed medication dosage unit, place it in a transportable package, and label the package for the health care personnel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for distributing individual dosage units of medication into containers, comprising: a first dispenser having a first plurality of shelves for holding the individual dosage units of medication, and a robotic picking unit having at least two-axis movement for selectively picking one of the individual dosage units of medication off of one of the first plurality of shelves and dropping the picked individual dosage unit of medication; a second dispenser having an A-frame, a plurality of storage cells coupled to the A-frame for holding the individual dosage units of medication, each of the plurality of storage cells being motorized and operable to individually dispense the individual dosage units of medication, a dedicated controller unit coupled to the A-frame for controlling the operation of the plurality of storage cells, and a first conveyor for receiving the dispensed individual dosage units of medication, the second dispenser being operable to dispense the individual dosage units of medication at a faster rate than the first dispenser; a second conveyor for conveying the individual dosage units of medication dropped by the first dispenser and conveyed by the first conveyor; a bagger being operable to receive the individual dosage units of medication from the second conveyor and to selectively place the individual dosage units of medication into the containers; and a programmable controller electrically coupled to the first and second dispensers, the bagger, and the dedicated controller and being operable to direct the first and second dispensers to dispense the individual dosage units of medication and to direct the bagger to place the individual dosage units of medication into the containers. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, comprising a third dispenser having housing, a vertically rotating carousel disposed in the housing and having a second plurality of shelves for holding the individual dosage units of medication, and a third conveyor for conveying individual dosage units of medication removed from the second plurality of shelves to the second conveyor, the third dispenser being operable to dispense the individual dosage units of medication at a slower rate than the first dispenser. 3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the programmable controller comprises a personal computer. 4. The apparatus of claim 1, comprising a storage bin to receive the individual dosage units of medication from the first and second dispensers, and a diverter electrically coupled to the programmable controller and being operable to selectively divert the individual dosage units of medication to either the bagger for automated packaging into the containers or to the storage bin for manual packaging into the containers. 5. The apparatus of claim 1, comprising a bar code scanner being operable to scan the individual dosage units of medication for a preselected parameter and send the results of the scan to the programmable controller. 6. An apparatus for distributing individual dosage units of medication into containers, comprising: a first dispenser having a first plurality of shelves for holding the individual dosage units of medication, and a robotic picking unit having at least two-axis movement for selectively picking one of the individual dosage units of medication off of one of the first plurality of shelves and dropping the picked individual dosage unit of medication; a second dispenser having an A-frame, a plurality of storage cells coupled to the A-frame for holding the individual dosage units of medication, each of the plurality of storage cells being motorized and operable to individually dispense the individual dosage units of medication, a dedicated controller unit coupled to the A-frame for controlling the operation of the plurality of storage cells, and a first conveyor for receiving the dispensed individual dosage units of medication, the second dispenser being operable to dispense the individual dosage units of medication at a faster rate than the first dispenser; a second conveyor for conveying the individual dosage units of medication dropped by the first dispenser and conveyed by the first conveyor, the second conveyor having third, fourth, fifth, and sixth continuous running conveyors; a bagger being operable to receive the individual dosage units of medication from the second conveyor and to selectively place the individual dosage units of medication into the containers; a storage bin to receive the individual dosage units of medication from the second conveyor; a diverter having a pivotable plate to selectively divert the individual dosage units of medication to either the bagger or the storage bin; and a personal computer electrically coupled to the first and second dispensers, the bagger, the dedicated controller, and the diverter, and being operable to direct the first and second dispensers to dispense the individual dosage units of medication, the diverter to divert the individual dosage units of medication to either the storage bin or the bagger, and to direct the bagger to place the individual dosage units of medication into the containers. 7. The apparatus of claim 6, comprising a third dispenser having housing, a vertically rotating carousel disposed in the housing and having a second plurality of shelves for holding the individual dosage units of medication, and a seventh conveyor for conveying individual dosage units of medication removed from the second plurality of shelves to the second conveyor, the third dispenser being operable to dispense the individual dosage units of medication at a slower rate than the first dispenser.
