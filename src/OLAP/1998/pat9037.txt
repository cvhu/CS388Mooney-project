Vibration data is transmitted from a remote site to a control facility using wireless data transmission. In one embodiment, the vibration signal is conditioned and digitized, and then sent via satellite to a hub satellite receiving station. From the hub satellite receiving station, the data may be sent to the control facility via the public telephone network.
