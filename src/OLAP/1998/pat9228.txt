The invention provides a hot plate oven and a method suitable to bake materials on substrates such as flat panel displays and large semiconductor wafers such as 300 mm in diameter and above. The hot plate oven in one embodiment includes an insulated chamber, a heater in the chamber, a door for entry of a substrate, a frame, preferably water cooled, for suspending the substrate above the heater, a substrate lowering mechanism to hold the frame and lower the substrate to a certain height above the heater, and a set of manifolds and valves to feed and exhaust gases, vapors, and apply a vacuum to the chamber. In another feature, the oven assembly includes a stack of low profile ovens, each having a door on the side for entry of a substrate.
Claims What is claimed: 1. A method of baking coating materials on a substrate, comprising: opening the door of an oven chamber with a heater to provide access to a wafer handler; placing a coated substrate on a display holding frame in the oven chamber with the wafer handler; holding the coated substrate on the display holding frame along the edges of the coated substrate; closing the door of the oven chamber; lowering the display holding frame very close to the heater for uniform heating of the coated substrate; heating the coated substrate; counteracting any sag of the coated substrate by a fluid cooled central pin which is higher than the top surface of the heater and disposed in a central region of the heater; maintaining the temperature of the heater at a predetermined level; and removing the coated substrate from the oven chamber after heating the coated substrate for a predetermined time.
