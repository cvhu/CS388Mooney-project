There is disclosed a quantitative sensitive method to enable the detection of point mutations at a known site to a diagnostic kit which uses a multi step (for example, four steps) or a single step reaction. The method uses selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mutant test gene sequences involving first stage amplification of both mutant and wild-type sequences, first stage restriction enzyme digestion of only wild-type sequences, second stage amplification of undigested amplified fragments enriched in mutant sequences and second stage digestion of previously undigested wild-type sequences. Long and short tail primers are used in the first and second stages of amplification respectively to enable selective amplification (in the second stage) of only previously amplified material and none of the original test genomic DNA. The short tail primers are labelled with biotin and fluorescence at their respective 5' and 3' ends to enable easy detection and quantitation of mutations in the test gene via automated fluorescence readers. The use of multi steps as well as a single step reaction is disclosed. The process is exemplified with respect to its use in detecting mutations in the human K-ras gene, yet it is applicable for any given mutation in a defined site.
Claims I claim: 1. A diagnostic kit for use in an assay for detecting the presence or absence on a first genomic nucleic acid strand of a genomic region containing a mutant nucleotide sequence, wherein said genomic region can contain the mutant nucleotide sequence or a wild-type sequence, wherein said first genomic nucleic acid strand is present in a test sample in the form of a first genomic duplex consisting of the first genomic nucleic acid strand and a first complementary nucleic acid strand, and wherein the assay comprises at least a first and a second amplification step, said kit comprising: a) a first reagent mixture for use in the first amplification step wherein the first nucleic acid duplexes are synthesized in a polymerase chain reaction with synthesis of a first synthesized duplex, said first mixture comprising upstream and downstream long tail primers, each of said upstream and downstream long tail primers comprising a complementary primer portion and a non-complementary primer portion, the complementary primer portion of the upstream long tail primers being sufficiently complementary to a first end portion of the first complementary nucleic acid strand to enable the upstream long tail primers to anneal thereto and thereby to initiate synthesis of a nucleic acid extension product using the first complementary strand as a template, the complementary primer portion of the downstream long tail primers being sufficiently complementary to a first end portion of the first genomic strand to enable the downstream primers to anneal thereto and thereby to initiate synthesis of a nucleic acid extension product using the first genomic strand as a template, the non-complementary primer portions of said upstream and downstream long tail primers not being sufficiently complementary to either the first genomic strand or the first complementary strand to anneal with either, the non-complementary primer portions of the respective upstream and downstream long tail primers being positioned on the upstream and downstream long tail primers such that a first end portion of the first synthesized strand of synthesized duplexes formed using the upstream and downstream primers has nucleotide sequences that are identical to the nucleotide sequences of the non-complementary primer portion of the upstream long tail primers and such that a first end portion of the first complementary synthesized strand of synthesized duplexes formed using the upstream and downstream primers has nucleotide sequences that are identical to the nucleotide sequences of the non-complementary primer portion of the downstream primers, and b) a second reagent mixture for use in the second amplification step comprising upstream and downstream short tail primers, each of said upstream short tail primers comprising nucleotide sequences which are sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequences in the non-complementary primer portion of the upstream long tail primers to anneal thereto but which are not sufficiently complementary to nucleotide sequences in either the first genomic strand or the first complementary genomic strand to anneal thereto, each of said downstream short tail primers comprising nucleotide sequences which are sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequences in the non-complementary primer portion of the downstream long tail primers to anneal thereto but which are not sufficiently complementary to nucleotide sequences in either the first genomic strand or the first complementary genomic strand to anneal thereto, whereby the upstream and downstream short tail primers can be used in the second amplification step selectively to amplify synthesized duplexes synthesized in the first amplification step and none of the first genomic duplexes. 2. A kit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the upstream short tail primers are labelled with biotin and the downstream short tail primers are labelled with a fluorescent label. 3. A kit as claimed in claim 2, wherein the kit further comprises a microtiter plate coated with avidin or strepavidin. 4. A kit as claimed in claim 2 wherein each of the first and second reagent mixtures further comprises four different nucleoside triphosphates, a DNA polymerase and a buffer. 5. A kit as claimed in claim 3, wherein the kit further comprises a first microtiter plate comprising the first reaction mixture. 6. A reagent mix for use in amplification of nucleic acid duplexes, said reagent mix comprising a thermostable nucleic acid polymerase, a thermostable restriction enzyme which selectively cleaves the nucleic acid duplexes if and only if the duplexes contain a specific nucleotide sequence, upstream and downstream primers for annealing to each strand of the nucleic acid duplexes whereby to initiate formation of nucleic acid extension products, four different nucleotide triphosphates, and a buffer suitable for enabling the restriction enzyme to cleave duplexes containing the specific nucleotide sequence and for enabling the polymerase to catalyze formation of the nucleic acid extension products.
