An automatic welding apparatus including a robot which comprises a base, a rotary support rotatably mounted on the base, a pair of first arms pivotally movable together and rotatably supported each at its one end by the rotary support, a second arm rotatably supported by the other ends of the first arms at an intermediate portion close to its one end, and a hand connected to the other end of the second arm and rotatable about two axes intersecting each other at right angles. A core wire is supplied from a feeder to a welding torch attached to the hand of the robot. A control device controls movement of the robot, operation of the core wire feeder and power supply to the welding torch. When the forward end of the welding torch comes into contact with the work to be welded, with the core wire drawn into the torch, the resulting short-circuiting is detected to detect the position of the work. The amount of the core wire to be projected from the torch is controlled with reference to the position of the work thus detected.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of controlling an automatic welding apparatus comprising a welding torch for welding the work to be welded, a robot for movably supporting the welding torch, a feeder for supplying a core wire to the welding torch, and a control device for controlling supply of power to the welding torch, movement of the robot and operation of the core wire feeder, charaterized in that the method comprises the steps of causing the robot to move first until the forward end of the welding torch comes into contact with the work with the forward end of the core wire drawn completely into the torch, subsequently causing the robot to move so that the forward end of the welding torch is brought away from the work by a predetermined amount, and thereafter causing the core wire feeder to inch the core wire until the forward end of the core wire is projected from the welding torch into contact with the work. 2. A method as defined in claim 1 wherein the control device comprises a main control unit for feeding control signals for operating the robot and the core wire feeder as predetermined and other required control signals, a welding power supply operable in response to a welding mode signal from the main control unit, and a changeover-detection unit including a detecting power supply circuit and operable to selectively feed to the welding torch welding power from the welding power supply or detecting voltage from the detecting power supply circuit in response to the welding mode signal or a detecting mode signal from the main control unit and to feed to the main control unit a first detecting signal indicating the contact of the forward end of the welding torch with the work and a second detecting signal indicating the contact of the forward end of the core wire projected from the torch with the work. 3. A method as defined in claim 2 wherein the changeover-detection unit comprises, in addition to the detecting power supply circuit, an interface circuit for transmission of signals with the main control unit, a changeover signal generating circuit for generating a first changeover signal and a second changeover signal upon receiving the detecting mode signal and the welding mode signal, respectively, via the interface circuit, a changeover circuit for bringing the detecting power supply circuit into conduction with the welding torch in response to the first changeover signal and bringing the welding power supply into conduction with the welding torch in response to the second changeover signal, and a detecting circuit for detecting the contact of the welding torch end and the core wire end with the work and feeding the corresponding detecting signals to the main control unit via the interface circuit. 4. A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the robot comprises a base, a rotary support swivellably mounted on the base and reciprocatingly rotatable by first drive means, a pair of first arms each rotatably supported at its one end by the rotary support and reciprocatingly pivotally movable together by second drive means, a second arm rotatably supported between the other ends of the first arms at an intermediate portion close to its one end and reciprocatingly pivotally movable by third drive means, and a hand connected to the other end of the second arm reciprocatingly rotatable about a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis at right angles therewith by fourth drive means and fifth drive means, respectively, the hand having the welding torch attached thereto. 5. A method as defined in claim 4 wherein said one end of each of the first arms is rotatably supported by a bracket mounted upright on the rotary support, and the second drive means comprises a drive motor attached to one side of the bracket and coupled to said one end of one of the first arms by a reduction mechanism, the other first arm being connected to said one first arm by a connecting member. 6. A method as defined in claim 4 wherein said one end of each of the first arms is rotatably supported by a bracket mounted upright on the rotary support, and the third drive means comprises a drive motor attached to one side of the bracket, a transmission shaft rotatably provided between said one ends of the first arms and coupled to the drive motor by a reduction mechanism, a lever fixed at its one end to the transmission shaft and a link having one end connected to the other end of the lever by a pin and the other end connected to said end of the second arm by a pin. 7. A method as defined in claim 4, wherein a pair of bosses are fixed to said other ends of the first arms, and the intermediate portion of the second arm close to said one end therof is rotatably supported by the bosses. 8. A method as defined in claim 7 wherein the fourth drive means comprises a drive motor attached to one of the first arms, a first sprocket positioned within said one of the first arms and coupled to the drive motor by a reduction mechanism, an intermediate shaft rotatably extending through one of the bosses, a second sprocket mounted on one end of the intermediate shaft positioned within said one first arm, a first chain coupling the first sprocket to the second sprocket, a third sprocket mounted on the other end of the intermediate shaft positioned within the second arm, a fourth sprocket disposed within said other end of the second arm and functionally connected to the hand for rotating the hand about the first axis, and a second chain coupling the third sprocket to the fourth sprocket. 9. A method as defined in claim 7 wherein the fifth drive means comprises a drive motor attached to one of the first arms, a first sprocket positioned within said one of the first arms and coupled to the drive motor by a reduction mechanism, an intermediate shaft rotatably extending through one of the bosses, a second sprocket mounted on one end of the intermediate shaft positioned within said one first arm, a first chain coupling the first sprocket to the second sprocket, a third sprocket mounted on the other end of the intermediate shaft positioned within the second arm, a fourth sprocket disposed within said other end of the second arm and functionally connected to the hand for rotating the hand about the second axis, and a second chain coupling the third sprocket to the fourth sprocket.
