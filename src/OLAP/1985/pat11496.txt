A hand (10) capable of simultaneously handling a plurality of articles (11) comprising a pickup head (15) having a plurality of vacuum pickup cavities (18), each cavity substantially matching the size and shape of the article to be handled. In one embodiment, the pickup head comprises a seal (26) positioned around an article-matching cavity (18) thereof and an opening (19) therethrough for communicating the cavity (18) with a vacuum chamber (20). In another embodiment, the pickup head comprises, positioned within its opening, a bellows (48) having a cylindrical sleeve (51) at one end and a planar flange (49) coupled to the vacuum chamber (20) by means of a seal (52) at its other end.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for handling an article comprising: a pickup head having first and second planar surfaces, the pickup head having a cavity formed therein proximate its first planar surface and substantially conforming to the geometry of an article to be handled; an opening formed in the pickup head for communicatively coupling the cavity with a chamber proximate the second planar surface of the pickup head; an elongated bellows having a first and a second end portion, said bellows being dimensioned to slide within said opening; a flange attached to the first end portion of the bellows and having a central aperture communicatively coupled to the chamber; and a sleeve attached to the second end portion of the bellows and dimensioned to slidably fit within said opening. 2. An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein a portion of said sleeve extends away from said cavity in the absence of vacuum applied to the chamber. 3. An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, in response to vacuum applied to the chamber, the sleeve when contacting an article slides into the opening as said bellows contracts within said opening. 4. A robotic hand for simultaneously handling a plurality of articles comprising: a plate-like pickup head having first and second planar surfaces; a plurality of cavities formed in the pickup head proximate to the first planar surface thereof, said cavities substantially matching the respective size and shape of the articles to be handled; a like plurality of openings located within the pickup head and extending between the first and the second planar surface thereof for communicatively coupling a corresponding one of said plurality of cavities to a source of vacuum; a like plurality of selectively retractable and expandable means slidably fitting within said openings for simultaneously retaining and releasing the plurality of articles to be handled in and out of said cavities, each said retractable and expandable means including: an elongated bellows having a first and a second end portion, said bellows being dimensioned to slide within its corresponding opening; a flange attached to the first end portion of the bellows and having a central aperture communicatively coupled to the source of vacuum; and a sleeve attached to the second end portion of the bellows and dimensioned to slidably fit within its corresponding opening. 5. Method for simultaneously transferring a plurality of articles from a first work station to a second work station comprising the steps of: directing to the first work station an apparatus having a plurality of article-matching cavities formed therein, each cavity having an opening therein which receives a bellows provided with a flange at its upper end having a central aperture, and the bellows having a sleeve at its lower end which is dimensioned to fit within the opening in said cavity; aligning the sleeve at the lower end of the bellows in each cavity with a separate one of the plurality of articles located at the first work station; applying vacuum to said plurality of cavities to retract each of the bellows from its normal expanded state and thereby pull the plurality of articles into their corresponding matching cavities while maintaining their initial orientation and spacing; moving the apparatus with the plurality of articles held therein to the second work station; and interrupting the vacuum to cause each bellows to return to its expanded state thereby releasing the articles in their initial orientation and spacing out of their corresponding matching cavities onto the second work station.
