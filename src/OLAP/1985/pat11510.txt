An articulating waveguide arm assembly, comprising long arm segments, (11, 12, 15, 17, 19) and short corner segments (13, 14, 16, 18) has a single-mode hollow dielectric waveguide located inside each segment and an optically reflecting device (33, 34, 37, 38, 39) located at the end of each segment. The waveguide assembly is mechanically affixed to a robot assembly having protruding side shields (65, 66). The robot assembly includes a pair of long arms (61, 62) corresponding to a pair of the waveguide arms (15, 17). Another waveguide arm segment (12) of the waveguide assembly passes over the protruding side shields and terminates in a pair of successive corner segments (13, 14) for enabling a laser beam propagating through this long arm segment to enter into one of the pair of long waveguide segments (61). The robot arm segments control the orientation of corresponding articulating waveguide arm segments, whereby a laser beam entering the articulating waveguide arm assembly will exit from the waveguide assembly positioned and oriented as determined by the positions and orientations of the robot arm segments.
