The method of assembling lead-mounted electric components such as DIP 18 in automated fashion to a printed circuit board 14 is accomplished by building up a crimping tool (FIG. 7) comprising a base 28 with crimping anvils 12, 20, 22, 24, by selectively positioning and orienting the anvils on the base while the base is energized to provide a moderately low strength field, and the base is then energized to provide an adequately high strength magnetic field to retain the anvils properly during the subsequent steps of mounting the components to the board and crimping the leads to produce a particular type of board. After the requisite number of boards of a particular type are built, the anvils are removed to storage and the base is rebuilt to provide a different array of anvils for a different board.
Claims I claim: 1. The method of assembling in automated fashion lead-mounted electric components to a printed circuit board, comprising: (a) stationing a magnetic field-controllable base, adapted to receive a plurality of lead-crimping anvils of ferromagnetic material thereon, within the working envelope of a robotic manipulator; (b) controlling said magnetic field-controllable base to provide a moderately low strength magnetic field; (c) selectively positioning and orienting said crimping anvils on said base in an array to completely accommodate the leads of all the lead-mounted electrical components to be crimped for a given circuit board; (d) increasing the field strength of said base to provide an adequately high strength field to ensure retention of said anvils in the proper location and orientation during subsequent steps; and (e) mounting said components to said board and crimping said leads to produce said given circuit board. 2. The method of claim 1 including: removing all circuit boards of said given type; reducing the field strength of said base to at least a degree that the field strength permits relatively easy removal of said anvils from said base after the desired number of boards of a particular type have been assembled; removing said anvils; repeating the steps of (b), (c), (d), (e) of claim 1, except for positioning and orienting said anvils to present a different array, to produce circuit boards of another particular type. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein: utilizing an electromagnetic, field-controllable element as said base; and controlling the electrical energization to said base to effect the control of the field strength of said base. 4. The method of providing a fixture for the automated assembly of a printed circuit board to which lead-mounted electric components are secured, comprising: (a) providing an electromagnetic, field-controllable base adapted to receive a plurality of ferromagnetic lead-crimping anvils thereon; (b) energizing said electromagnetic field-controllable base to provide a moderately low strength field; (c) selectively positioning and orienting said crimping anvils on said base in an array to completely accommodate leads of all the lead-mounted electrical components to be crimped for a given circuit board; and (d) increasing the energization of said base to provide an adequately high strength field to ensure retention of said anvils at the proper location and orientation during the subsequent steps of mounting said components to said board and crimping said leads to produce boards of said given type.
