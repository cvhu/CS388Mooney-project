Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Interferon gamma receptor 2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Interferon gamma receptor 2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Interferon gamma receptor 2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Interferon gamma receptor 2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to a region consisting of nucleobases 1000 through 1092 of a nucleic acid molecule encoding human Interferon gamma receptor 2 (SEQ ID NO. 3), wherein said compound is an antisense oligonucleotide which comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage and wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with said region and inhibits the expression of human Interferon gamma receptor 2. 2. The compound of claim 1 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 3. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 5. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 7. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 8. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 9. The composition of claim 8 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system.
