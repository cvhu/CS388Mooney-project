The invention relates to a new device for and a new method of assembling stacking patterns and simultaneously stacking these stacking patterns by means of a robotic manipulator having at least one translational robotic axis.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A device for stacking cut-to-size board pieces at a stacking bin into a stack, said device including a stacking bin, a robotic manipulator comprising first, second, and third translational axes and designed to pick said cut pieces, feed them to said stacking bin and to place them on said stacking bin in such a way that in placing said cut pieces a stacking pattern of said stack is assembled, a plurality of picking stations and a transport conveyor including a plurality of angular transfer stations designed for transporting cut pieces to each of said picking stations along a X-direction, said picking stations being assigned to one stacking bin each, arranged juxtaposed in said X-direction and each assigned to an angular transfer station of said transport conveyor for diverting said cut pieces into a Y-direction perpendicular to said X-direction, wherein said first translational axis of said robotic manipulator is oriented along said X-direction and said robotic manipulator can be shifted along said first axis to attain each of said picking stations and each of said stacking bins, said second translational axis of said robotic manipulator is oriented along said Y-direction and said robotic manipulator can be shifted along said second axis to move from a picking station to each assigned stacking bin and vice-versa, and said third translational axis of said robotic manipulator oriented perpendicular to said X-direction and to said Y-direction for movement of said robotic manipulator along said third axis for picking cut pieces from a picking station and placing cut pieces at a stacking bin, said transport conveyor is designed for transporting cut pieces from a cutting device for cutting said pieces to said picking stations, and for separation of groups of cut pieces at said angular transfer stations in said X-direction between said cutting and diverting and for separation in said Y-direction between said diverting and picking. 2. The device as set forth in claim 1 wherein a further stacking bin is provided at which cut pieces can be stacked but no stacking patterns can be assembled, said stacking pattern in this case consisting of a single one of said cut pieces. 3. The device as set forth in claim 2 wherein a further robotic manipulator is added to at least one already existing robotic manipulator of said device in such a way that said two robotic manipulators can be traveled along a common translational axis in said X-direction.
