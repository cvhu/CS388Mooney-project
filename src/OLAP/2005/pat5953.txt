Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An oligomeric compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising SEQ ID NO:73, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O--CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OCH.sub.3, 2'-O--CH.sub.3, or 2'-F moiety. 7. The compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O--CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OCH.sub.3 moiety. 8. The compound of claim 2 wherein the oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a. 5-methylcytosine. 10. The compound of claim 2 wherein the oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. The compound of claim 10 wherein the chimeric oligonucleotide comprises 2'-O--CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 OCH.sub.3 wings and a deoxy gap. 12. The compound of claim 1 wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a sodium salt or a potassium salt. 13. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 14. The composition of claim 13 wherein the oligomeric is an oligonucleotide. 15. The composition of claim 13 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 16. The composition of claim 14 further comprising another oligonucleotide. 17. A method of inhibiting the expression of damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127 in a cell or a tissue comprising contacting the cell or tissue in vitro with the compound of claim 1, wherein the expression of damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127 is inhibited. 18. A method of detecting the presence of damage-specific DNA binding protein 1, p127 in a cell or a tissue comprising contacting the cell or tissue in vitro with the compound of claim 1 and detecting the presence of the compound. 19. A kit comprising the compound of claim 1.
