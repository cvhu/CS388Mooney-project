A method and apparatus for a mixed-mode operation of an electrostatic chuck in a semiconductor substrate processing system. The chuck is operated in a voltage mode before and after a processing and is operated in a current mode during the processing to suppress arcing during the processing of a substrate.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of operating an electrostatic chuck, comprising: applying a controlled first voltage to said electrostatic chuck prior to processing a substrate; determining if a current produced by the first voltage is greater than a current limit; if the current is less than or equal to the current limit, maintaining the first voltage during substrate processing; if the current is greater than the current limit, adjusting the current until the current is less than or equal to the current limit; and applying a controlled second voltage to said electrostatic chuck after processing of the substrate. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the processing is plasma processing. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said electrostatic chuck is a bipolar electrostatic chuck. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said electrostatic chuck is a unipolar electrostatic chuck. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein values of the controlled first voltage, the controlled second voltage, and the controlled current are defined prior to processing of the substrate. 6. The method of claim 1 further comprising determining whether, during current adjustment, the first voltage obtains a predefined limit; if the first voltage is less than the predefined level, stop adjusting the current. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein adjusting the current suppresses arcing during processing of the substrate.
