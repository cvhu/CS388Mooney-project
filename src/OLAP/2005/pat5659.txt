A CPU 15 determines an output of a feeling model based on signals supplied from a touch sensor 20. The CPU 15 also deciphers whether or not an output value of the feeling model exceeds a pre-set threshold value. If the CPU finds that the output value exceeds the pre-set threshold value, it verifies whether or not there is any vacant area in a memory card 13. If the CPU finds that there is any vacant area in a memory card 13, it causes the picture data captured from the CCD video camera 11 to be stored in the vacant area in the memory card 13. At this time, the CPU 15 causes the time and date data and the feeling parameter in the memory card 13 in association with the picture data. The CPU 15 also re-arrays the picture data stored in the memory card 13 in the sequence of the decreasing magnitude of the feeling model output.
