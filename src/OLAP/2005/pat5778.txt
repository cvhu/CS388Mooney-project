Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of polo-like kinase. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding polo-like kinase. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of polo-like kinase expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of polo-like kinase are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 20 to 80 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding polo-like kinase, wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid molecule encoding polo-like kinase and inhibits expression of polo-like kinase and comprises SEQ ID NO: 56. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
