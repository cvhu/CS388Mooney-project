Device serving for accommodating a small outer diameter vial in a larger diameter opening of a variety of different autosamplers and which controls the depth of insertion of an autosampler extraction element. The device comprises a sleeve having a body defined by an exterior surface of the sleeve, for accurately fitting the sleeve in a large diameter opening of an autosampler, and by an interior surface of the sleeve, for accurately fitting therein a small outer diameter vial, whereby an otherwise incompatible small outer diameter vial and larger diameter opening autosampler are rendered compatible.
Claims I claim: 1. A precision locating and supporting device for accommodating a small outer diameter vial in a larger diameter opening of a variety of different autosamplers and which controls the depth of insertion of autosampler extraction means comprising a sleeve, means defined by an exterior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting the sleeve in a large diameter opening of an autosampler, means defined by an interior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting therein a small outer diameter vial whereby an otherwise incompatible small outer diameter vial and larger diameter opening autosampler are rendered compatible, said sleeve including a tubular body having at one end an annular collar and at an opposite end a cut-out defining a semi-tubular end provided with a semi-annular column, and an axial slit extending along the body and collar. 2. A precision locating and supporting device for accommodating a small outer diameter vial in a larger diameter opening of a variety of different autosamplers and which controls the depth of insertion of autosampler extraction means comprising a sleeve, means defined by an exterior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting the sleeve in a large diameter opening of an autosampler, means defined by an interior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting therein a small outer diameter vial whereby an otherwise incompatible small outer diameter vial and larger diameter opening autosampler are rendered compatible, said interior surface being an axial bore in which the ratio of the height of the sleeve to outside diameter is in the range of 1.5 to 4.5, the ratio of said outside diameter to said inside diameter is in the range of 1.5 to 2.75, said sleeve being a tubular body having at one end an annular collar and at an opposite end a cut-off defining a semi-tubular end provided with a semi-annular collar and an axial slit extending along the body and collar. 3. A precision locating and supporting device for accommodating a small outer diameter vial in a larger diameter opening of a variety of different autosamplers and which controls the depth of insertion of autosampler extraction means comprising a sleeve, means defined by an exterior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting the sleeve in a large diameter opening of an autosampler, means defined by an interior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting therein a small outer diameter vial whereby an otherwise incompatible small outer diameter vial and larger diameter opening autosampler are rendered compatible, said interior surface defines a bore closed at one end, said sleeve being a tubular body having at one end an annular collar and at an opposite end a cut-off defining a semi-tubular end provided with a semi-annular column, and an axial slit extending along the body and collar. 4. A precision locating and supporting device for accommodating a small outer diameter vial in a larger diameter opening of a variety of different autosamplers and which controls the depth of insertion of autosampler extraction means comprising a sleeve, means defined by an exterior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting the sleeve in a large diameter opening of an autosampler, means defined by an interior surface of said sleeve for accurately fitting therein a small outer diameter vial whereby an otherwise incompatible small outer diameter vial and larger diameter opening autosampler are rendered compatible, said sleeve including a tubular body having at one end an annular collar and at an opposite end a cut-out defining a semi-tubular end provided with a semi-annular column, an axial slit extending along the body and collar, and a vial fitted in said tubular body.
