A method for controlling a robotic vehicle as the robotic is traversed from an origination node to a destination node is disclosed. An optimal nodal path is determined from the origination node to the destination node. A deviation distance is calculated from the actual location of the robotic vehicle to the optimal nodal path. This deviation distance is compared with the specified distance. If the deviation distance exceeds the specified distance, a determination is made as to whether correction of the travel path of the robotic vehicle by a combination of curves method would result in the robotic vehicle returning to the optimal path beyond a node to be traversed next. Correction of the travel path is effected by the combination of curves method if correction by such a method would result in the robotic vehicle returning to the optimal nodal path prior to the node to be traversed next. On the other hand, correction of the travel path is effected by a side-step movement method if correction of the travel path by the combination of curves method would result in the robotic vehicle returning to the optimal nodal path beyond the node to be traversed next.
