A robotic connector or interface includes a roughly conical male member in which the conical side may be concave. The male member includes a radial indexing pin, and a central bore in which polarized electrical connectors are located. A mating female member includes a cavity with a fundus and movable peripheral lips adapted for grasping the base of the male member when engaged for drawing the male member into full mating relation with the cavity. A tapered slot in the side of the female member guides the index pin to impart rotational forces so that mating can take place even if the approach is skewed. The electrical connectors are mounted on a separately indexed, spring loaded connector plate at the fundus of the cavity. A motor-driven linkage operates the peripheral lip members.

A coupling arrangement according to claim 7 wherein each of said fingers comprises a track, said track engaging a stationary rider located near said periphery of said cavity, at least a portion of each of said fingers being capable of motion in a generally axial direction as said track runs along said stationary rider, said track being arranged for causing said distal ends of said fingers to move between said open and closed positions in response to said axial movement. 9. A coupling arrangement for aligning and mating connectors, and for transfer of structural loads, comprising: a male member including a head, said head having the approximate shape of the frustum of a cone, including a base, tapered side, and a central bore, said base and said central bore being centered on a first axis lying in a first plane, said base being affixed to a support structure to which said loads are transferred, said head further comprising at least one of (a) an elongated index protrusion having a lateral width, said index protrusion having the direction of elongation lying in said first plane and projecting from said tapered side of said head in a radial direction relative to said first axis, and (b) an elongated slot in said tapered side of said head, said slot having the direction of elongation lying in said first plane, said slot having a first width at location near said base, and tapering to a second width greater than said first width at locations remote from said base; a polarized first connector portion of a mating polarized connector pair, said first connector portion being located in said bore for substantially axial engagement and having a predetermined orientation relative to said first plane; a female member defining a cavity with an opening defining an outer periphery, said cavity being centered on a second axis lying in a second plane and having walls in the general shape of a truncated cone, said walls defining a fundus remote from said opening of said cavity, said female member further including at least one of (a) an elongated slot in said walls of said cavity when said male member includes an index protrusion projecting from said tapered side, the direction of elongation of said slot lying in said second plane, the width of said slot being substantially equal to said lateral width of said index protrusion at locations nearest said fundus, and tapering to a width greater than said lateral width at locations remote from said fundus, and (b) an elongated index protrusion extending from said walls of said cavity when said male member includes said elongated slot in said tapered side, said elongated index protrusion having a lateral width substantially equal to said first width of said elongated slot in said tapered side of said male member, the direction of elongation and the direction of protrusion of said index protrusion lying in said second plane, whereby said second axis and said second plane are drawn into congruence with said first axis and said first plane, respectively, when said male and female members are fully mated; a polarized second connector portion of said mating polarized connector pair, said second connector portion being mounted for axial engagement at said fundus and having said predetermined orientation relative to said second plane, whereby when said male and female members are mated and said first and second planes are congruent, said connectors are correctly poled for mating; movable lip means mechanically coupled to said periphery and adapted for movement between an open position exposing said cavity and a closed position, and being adapted for grasping said head of said male member during engagement and for drawing said head into full mating relationship with said cavity and thereafter pressing against said base of said head for holding said head in full mating relation with said cavity, whereby rotary forces are transferred by means including said index protrusions and mating slots between said female member and said support structure, and axial tension forces are transferred by said lip means bearing against said base.
