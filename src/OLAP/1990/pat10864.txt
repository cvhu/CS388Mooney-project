Method and system for the automated assembly of power train components along a plurality of interconnected, closed loops within cells of the system wherein parts and/or subassemblies of the components are assembled on the same assembly pallet on which they were robotically kitted. Along some of the loops, the assembly pallets are automatically transferred from kitting stations to assembly stations and from the assembly stations to an unload station where the components or subassemblies are robotically unloaded. The unloaded assembly pallets are then automatically transferred from the unload station to the kitting stations to repeat the assembly process. A mechanical guided vehicle system (MGVS) asynchronously conveys the assembly pallets along the closed loops which form guide tracks between the different stations. An automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) preferably transports part storage pallets to the system from a receiving area. Automated stacking cranes transfer the part storage pallets to and from predetermined part positions within queuing rack structures adjacent the kitting and assembly stations. The queuing rack structures and the automatic stacking cranes form part of an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) which interconnect the different closed loop guide tracks. The queuing rack structure also stores subassemblies loaded on assembly pallets. Manual kitting and assembly areas are also provided. Fastening robots are provided at fastening stations located along selected ones of the guide tracks. A distributed or hierarchial control system controls each of the elements of the system.
