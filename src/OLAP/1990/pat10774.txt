A multi-line electronic media barrier or safety system for preventing liquid contamination of air lines, including a capacitance proximity sensor for detecting a foreign undesirable medium such as paint in an air line. When foreign media is detected, a main air valve is closed which in turn closes valves connected in the air lines, thereby blocking passage of air or liquid and protecting pneumatic control apparatus. The media barrier is especially designed for use with automated or robotic paint spray devices utilized in industry.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A safety system for detecting foreign media in pneumatic lines and for closing the lines in response thereto, comprising: (a) a pneumatic line, (b) a capacitive sensor positioned adjacent the pneumatic line for sensing the presence of foreign media in the pneumatic line, the sensor having means for generating a control signal upon the sensing of the foreign media in the pneumatic line, and (c) valve means interposed into said pneumatic line and coupled to said sensor, for controlling flow through said pneumatic line, wherein the valve means includes a main control valve electrically coupled to the sensor and a second pneumatically operated valve connected in the pneumatic line, the main control valve controlling the flow of air from an air supply to the second pneumatically operated valve and thereby controlling the second pneumatically operated valve, the main control valve being closed and shutting off the supply of air to the second pneumatically operated valve when the sensor senses foreign media in the line and sends the control signal to the main control valve, the second valve being closed and thereby blocking passage of air or foreign media through the pneumatic line when the main control valve closes and shuts off the supply of air to the second valve; the valve means providing for the flow blockage of the pneumatic line upon the receipt of said control signal from said sensor. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein said pneumatic line includes a first planar segment and said capacitance sensor includes a planar sensing head, the planar segment being positioned in close physical proximity to the planar sensing head. 3. The system of claim 2, further comprising at least one additional pneumatic line having a second planar segment, the respective planar segments positioned in planar alignment in close physical proximity, the planar segments disposed adjacent the planar sensing head. 4. The system of claim 1, further comprising at least one additional pneumatic line and a third pneumatically operated valve connected in the additional pneumatic line, the main control valve controlling air flow to the third pneumatically operated valve and thereby controlling the third pneumatically operated valve, the second and third valves being operated simultaneously by the main control valve, and both of the valves being closed in response to the presence of foreign media in one of the lines. 5. The system of claim 1, further comprising an audible alarm electrically coupled to the sensor for receiving the control signal generated by the sensor when foreign media is present in the line, the alarm being energized and audible upon receipt of the control signal. 6. The system of claim 1, further comprising a pneumatic visual indicator pneumatically coupled to the valve means and operated thereby upon the closing of the valve means, the absence of air flow to the indicator generating a visual signal to indicate the presence of foreign media in the pneumatic line. 7. A multi-line electronic media barrier for being positioned between a pneumatic control apparatus and a paint spray apparatus such as a robotic spray gun wherein the paint spray apparatus has fluid valves controllable by the pneumatic control apparatus, comprising: (a) a set of pneumatic control lines connected between the pneumatic control apparatus and the paint spray apparatus, each of the lines having a planar segment, the planar segments being positioned in planar alignment and in close physical proximity, (b) a capacitance sensor having a planar sensing head, the capacitance sensor being disposed between the pneumatic control apparatus and the paint spray apparatus, the planar sensing head being positioned immediately adjacent the planar segments, the sensor sensing the presence of foreign media in the pneumatic lines, the sensor having means for generating a control signal upon the sensing of the foreign media, (c) a main control valve electrically coupled to the sensor for providing for the closing of the pneumatic control lines upon receipt of the control signal from the sensor indicating the presence of foreign media in at least one of the lines, the main control valve being disposed in a main air supply line downstream from a main air supply, and (d) a set of media blocking valves, each of the valves disposed in a respective pneumatic control line downstream from the planar segments for closing the lines to the passage of air or foreign media, the valves being pneumatically coupled to the main air supply and operated by the main control valve so that when the sensor senses the presence of foreign media in one of the pneumatic control lines, the sensor generates the control signal, the main control valve being de-energized and closed upon receipt of the control signal and thereby closing the main air supply line and shutting off the supply of air to the set of media blocking valves which close in response thereto and block the passage of air or foreign media through the pneumatic control lines whereby contamination of the pneumatic control apparatus by foreign media such as paint is prevented. 8. A safety system for detecting liquid contaminants in pneumatic lines and for closing the lines in response thereto, comprising (a) a plurality of pneumatic lines having at least one segment wherein all the pneumatic lines are arranged in a group, wherein the lines at the segment are positioned in planar alignment in close physical proximity; (b) a capacitive sensor having a planar sensing head bridging across said group of lines, said sensing head positioned immediately adjacent said pneumatic lines' planar alignment segment; and said sensor having means for generating a control signal upon detection of liquid in any said pneumatic lines' planar alignment segment; (c) a pneumatic control valve operatively connected to control pneumatic flow through said pneumatic lines; and (d) means for coupling said sensor means for generating a control signal to said pneumatic control valve.
