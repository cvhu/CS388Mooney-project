The present invention provides for an apparatus and method for installing weather stripping in a body door opening. In its preferred embodiment the present invention provides a robot which can load itself from a weather stripping station, transfer the weather stripping to the body door opening, and install the weather stripping within the body door opening. The present invention also provides an end of arm tooling device for a robot above described. The present invention also includes a vehicle produced by the robot above described.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method of utilizing a robot having an arm and a pressure roller having a variable rotational velocity to install fixed lengths of weather stripping into a body opening including generally straight sections and corner sections, said method in combination comprising: interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a straight section of the opening at a first linear speed and at a first rotational speed and interacting and tracing said pressure roller along a corner section at a second linear speed differing from said first linear speed and at a second rotational speed differing from said first rotational speed, whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with the said sections as said fixed length is installed into said body opening and the relative velocity of a point on the periphery of said pressure roller relative to a point in said door opening in said corner section is such that said weather stripping is longitudinally compressed in said corner section.
