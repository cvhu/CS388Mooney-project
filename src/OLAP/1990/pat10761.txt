An arrangement for solder-coating respective end portions of elongated components in a molten solder bath includes a fixture to be loaded with the components. This fixture includes at least one supporting wall that is capable of maintaining the fixture afloat in a predetermined position on an upper surface of the molten solder bath even when the fixture is fully loaded. The supporting wall has at least one opening through which one of the end portions of a respective component passes into the molten solder bath to a depth necessary for the molten solder to coat the respective end portion to the desired extent when the fixture floats in its predetermined position on the molten solder bath. The fixture may be used in conjunction with a handling device which advantageously includes two pin-shaped projections that engage the fixture at two locations spaced from one another along a horizontal axis with freedom of movement of the fixture relative to the projections at least in the upward direction in that the projections are received in respective vertical slots of the fixture. These projections are then moved at least downwardly to an extent necessary at least to lower the fixture onto the upper surface of the molten bath and then to release the fixture for free floating on the upper surface of the molten solder bath.

A fixture for solder-coating respective end portions of elongated components that are loaded in the fixture in a molten solder bath, comprising means for maintaining the fixture afloat in a predetermined position on an upper surface of the molten solder bath even when fully loaded, including at least one supporting wall having at least one opening therein for the passage of one of the end portions of a respective component therethrough; means for holding the respective component on said supporting wall in a position in which the respective end portion thereof passes through said opening and, when the fixture floats in said predetermined position on the molten solder bath, into the molten solder bath to a depth necessary for the molten solder to coat the respective end portion to the desired extent; and means for maintaining the fixture afloat on the upper surface of the molten solder bath even when fully loaded in another position in which the fixture is turned through 180.degree. about a horizontal axis relative to said predetermined position thereof, including an additional supporting wall similar to said one supporting wall and having at least one auxiliary opening therein for the passage therethrough of another end portion of the respective component, and means for so connecting said additional supporting wall to said one supporting wall as to be spaced therefrom longitudinally of the respective component with said auxiliary opening being substantially aligned with said one opening. 5. An arrangement for solder-coating respective end portions of elongated components in a molten solder bath, comprising a fixture to be loaded with the components, including means for maintaining the fixture afloat in a predetermined position on an upper surface of the molten solder bath even when fully loaded, including at least one solid supporting wall having at least one opening therein for the passage of one of the end potions of a respective component therethrough and kept from sinking into the molten solder bath solely by surface tension effective between said solid supporting wall and the molten solder bath in said predetermined position of the fixture, and means for holding the respective component on said supporting wall in a position in which the respective end portion thereof passes through said opening and, when the fixture floats in said predetermined position on the molten solder bath, into the molten solder bath to a depth necessary for the molten solder to coat the respective end portion to the desired extent; and means for handling the fixture, including means for engaging said fixture at two locations spaced from one another along a horizontal axis with freedom of movement of said fixture relative to said engaging means at least in the upward direction, and means for moving said engaging means at least downwardly to an extent necessary at least to lower the fixture onto the upper surface of the molten bath and then to release said fixture for free floating on the upper surface of the molten solder bath, and subsequently upwardly to raise the fixture from the upper surface of the molten solder bath after re-engagement of said engaging means therewith. 6. The arrangement defined in claim 5 for use in simultaneous solder-coating of a plurality of the end portions, wherein said supporting wall of said fixture has at least one additional opening similar to and spaced from said one opening for the passage of another of the end portions to be solder-coated therethrough. 7. The arrangement as defined in claim 5, wherein said fixture further includes an additional supporting wall similar to said one supporting wall and having at least one auxiliary opening therein for the passage therethrough of another end portion of the respective component, and means for so connecting said additional supporting wall to said one supporting wall as to be spaced therefrom longitudinally of the respective component with said auxiliary opening being substantially aligned with said one opening. 8. An arrangement for solder-coating respective end portions of elongated components in a molten solder bath, comprising a fixture to be loaded with the components, including means for maintaining the fixture afloat in a predetermined position on an upper surface of the molten solder bath even when fully loaded, including at least one supporting wall having at least one opening therein for the passage of one of the end portions of a respective component therethrough, means for holding the respective component on said supporting wall in a position in which the respective end portion thereof passes through said opening and, when the fixture floats in said predetermined position on the molten solder bath, into the molten solder bath to a depth necessary for the molten solder to coat the respective end portion to the desired extent, means for maintaining the fixture afloat on the upper surface of the molten solder bath even when fully loaded in another position in which the fixture is turned through 180.degree. about a horizontal axis relative to said predetermined position thereof, including an additional supporting wall similar to said one supporting wall and having at least one auxiliary opening therein for the passage therethrough of another end portion of the respective component, and means for so connecting said additional supporting wall to said one supporting wall as to be spaced therefrom longitudinally of the respective component with said auxiliary opening being substantially aligned with said one opening; and means for handling the fixture, including means for engaging said fixture at two locations spaced from one another along a horizontal axis with freedom of movement of said fixture relative to said engaging means at least in the upward direction, and means for moving said engaging means at least downwardly to an extent necessary at least to lower the fixture onto the upper surface of the molten bath and then to release said fixture for free floating on the upper surface of the molten solder bath, and subsequently upwardly to raise the fixture from the upper surface of the molten solder bath after re-engagement of said engaging means therewith. 9.
