A control processor in a robotic system treats optically sensed locations along the seam path ahead of the tool, which are classified in relation to elapsed distances and identified in 3-D coordinates and 3-axes tool orientation, to apply in real time and under feedforward a control signal representing the error between anticipated tool position and anticipated sensed location on the path. In the process, the anticipated sensed location is obtained by interpolation between actually sensed locations. A taught path is recovered from the robot. The control processor operation is also based on elapsed distances and related to actual tool position provided by the robot.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of tracking a seam path with an effector end controlled by a robot, under supervision of an image processor having a look-ahead sensor for deriving a series of seam samples by sensing the seam ahead of the effector end, using a control processor responsive to successive present positions of the effector end derived from the robot, comprising with said control processor the steps of: deriving from said successive effector end present positions an elapsed distance for the last position thereof; deriving for said series of seam samples corresponding elapsed distances; determining with at least two last ones of said present positions an anticipated elapsed distance for a subsequent position; generating with at least the last, and one before the last, of said successive present positions a representation of a parametric function of the elapsed distance characterizing the effector end path as defined geometrically by said at least the last positions, said function having specified parameters; determining in response to said anticipated elapsed distance and with said specified function parameters an anticipated effector end position; identifying with said seam sampled by interpolation with said anticipated elapsed distance a corresponding seam sample; comparing said anticipated effector end position with said corresponding seam sample for deriving an error therebetween; and controlling the robot in accordance with said derived error for bringing the effector end on track with the seam path. 2. The method of claim 1, with said robot controlling step being performed with said error as feedforward control and cyclically, the elapsed distance and the corresponding sensed location being determined by the control processor upon each new effector end position and calculated anticipated effector end position. 3. The method of claim 2 with the look-ahead sensor being a predetermined distance from the effector end, the elapsed distances for the effector end positions and for the sensed seam locations being in relation to said predetermined distance. 4. A method according to claim 6 wherein the robot is iteratively providing a first signal representative of the present effector end position; the control processor being responsive to said first signal and to said seam samples for generating a control signal as an indication of said error between effector end position and seam sample; comprising the following operative steps by the control processor; calculating and storing iteratively, in response to said control signal and to said first signal, the elapsed distance of the effector end from the first down to the present effector end position; calculating and storing iteratively, in response to said control signal and to said first signal, the elapsed distance from the first down to the present sensed seam location by correlation with the distance between the effector end and the sensor; ordering and storing said data by reference to, and correlating said successive sensed locations with, said sensed location elapsed distances to provide a look-up table thereof; deriving iteratively with said first signal for a present effector end position and with said control signal for a present positioning of the effector end successive positions representing the effector end path; extrapolating by a predetermined amount from past positions on said effector end path to an anticipated position thereon; extrapolating by said predetermined amount from past elapsed distances to an anticipated elapsed distance for said effector end; determining from said anticipated elapsed distance in relation to said stored sensed location elapsed distances of said look-up table a corresponding anticipated sensed location; whereby said robot controlling step moves the effector end to said anticipated position following each past position of the effector end and each past control signal therefor. 5. The method of claim 4 with said seam sensor system providing position and orientation coordinates for a location a predetermined distance ahead of said effector end; with each of said seam samples representing the seam location in world coordinates; with said first signal providing for each present effector end control the effector end present position in world coordinates; with the additional control processor steps of: determining in world coordinates the chord of said predetermined distance extending between a present effector end position and a present sensed seam location; deriving from said effector end present position world coordinates an indication of the effector end direction of travel; determining with said chord and direction of travel an angle therebetween; and moving the sensor by rotation about said effector end by the amount of said determined angle; thereby to bring the sensor into position upon the seam prior to sensing another seam location thereupon. 6. The method of claim 5 with said control signal including position world coordinates for the effector end and orientation angles in world coordinates therefor; with said sensor moving step providing an additional orientation angle within said control signal. 7. The method of claim 4 with said first signal and control signal being provided cyclically upon each of a series of tick cycles, whereby the effector end is being moved, under a present control signal and upon each tick, from a present position to a next position along successive sensed locations of the seam. 8. The method of claim 7 with a present control signal being determined by said control processor in relation to an anticipated effector end, position situated three-ticks ahead of a present effector end position.
