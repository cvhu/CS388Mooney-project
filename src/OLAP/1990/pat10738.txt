The fastener of claim 8, wherein said locking groove is provided by a thread-like spiral locking groove. 10. In a fastener having a mandrel with an enlarged head and a generally cylindrical stem with a grooved locking section proximate said head and an annular breakneck groove distal said head and having a sleeve with a generally tubular portion abutting said head and surrounding a portion of said stem adjacent said head and a flange extending radially outward from the end of the tubular portion opposite said head with an axially inner face adjacent the tubular portion and an axially outer face distal the tubular portion, the improvement comprising: a tapered section adjacent said locking section distal said head and surrounding said breakneck groove, said tapered section being tapered radially outwardly toward said head and having a shoulder facing said head defining the end thereof between said breakneck groove and said locking section, whereby said shoulder provides an area circumferentially disposed about said stem for resisting withdrawal of the mandrel from the sleeve after the fastener has been installed. 11. A mandrel for a fastener, comprising: an enlarged head; and a generally cylindrical stem having: a locking section proximate said head having disposed about the periphery thereof a locking groove having a longitudinal component; and a tapered section adjacent said locking section distal said head having disposed therein an annular breakneck groove, the periphery of said tapered section being tapered radially outwardly toward said head at an angle of between 2.degree.-10.degree. from the longitudinal axis of said stem, the end of said tapered section adjacent the locking section having a substantially circular periphery of diameter equal to or greater than the outer diameter of said locking section and being defined by a shoulder, said shoulder facing said head for enhancing retention of said mandrel in position with respect to said sleeve. 12. The mandrel of claim 11, wherein the locking groove is provided by a spiral locking groove. 13. The mandrel of claim 11, wherein the periphery of said tapered section is tapered radially outwardly toward said head at an angle of between 3.degree.-31/2.degree. from the longitudinal axis of said stem. 14. A mandrel for a fastener, comprising: an enlarged head; and a generally cylindrical stem extending from said head having: a breakneck groove spaced from said head for allowing the stem to break at a predetermined location upon application of tension to said stem; a locking section between said head and said breakneck groove having disposed about the periphery thereof a locking groove having a longitudinal component; and a shoulder facing said head between said breakneck groove and said locking section having an outer diameter greater than or equal to that of said locking section, said shoulder providing a surface for enhancing retention of said mandrel in an installed fastener. 15. A joint, comprising: a plurality of adjacent members having aligned holes therethrough and a front surface and a rear surface; a sleeve having a generally tubular portion extending through the holes through said members with spaced first and second ends and having a flange extending radially outwardly from said first end of said tubular portion abutting said front surface, said first end protruding beyond said rear surface being upset; and a mandrel having an enlarged head proximate said rear surface and a generally cylindrical stem extending from said head through said sleeve having a locking section with a locking groove having a longitudinal component, a broken end distal said head, and a shoulder facing said head disposed between said broken end and locking section having an outer diameter equal to or greater than the outer diameter of said locking section, wherein said sleeve material substantially fills said locking groove and abuts said shoulder, thereby locking said mandrel in position relative to said sleeve and fastening said members. 16. A method of fastening a plurality of members having holes therethrough, comprising the steps: providing a mandrel with an enlarged head and a generally cylindrical stem extending therefrom having a grooved locking section proximate said head and a tapered section adjacent said locking section distal said head, said tapered section being tapered radially outwardly toward said head and having an annular breakneck groove disposed therein and a shoulder defining the end thereof between said breakneck groove and said locking section; providing a sleeve with a generally tubular portion abutting said head and surrounding a portion of said stem adjacent said head, a flange extending radially outward from the end of the tubular portion opposite said head having an axially inner face adjacent the tubular portion and an axially outer face distal the tubular portion; aligning the holes through said members; inserting the fastener mandrel head and sleeve tubular portion into the holes through said members; placing a powered fastener installation device nosepiece about the mandrel stem and against the flange outer face; gripping the mandrel stem with jaws provided in the powered fastener installation device; simultaneously pulling the mandrel stem axially away from the workpiece and compressing the sleeve axially toward the workpiece; upsetting the sleeve tubular portion; compressing the members; displacing material from the sleeve into the locking groove and against the tapered section shoulder, thereby locking said mandrel with respect to said sleeve and preventing unfastening of said members; and breaking the mandrel stem at the breakneck groove. 17. A method of using a powered fastener installation device to fasten a plurality of members having holes therethrough, comprising the steps: providing a sleeve with a generally tubular portion with spaced first and second ends and a flange extending radially outwardly from said first end of said tubular portion; providing a mandrel with an enlarged head and a generally cylindrical stem extending from said head through said sleeve, said stem having a locking section proximate said head with a locking groove having a longitudinal component, an annular breakneck groove proximate said locking section and distal said head, and a shoulder facing said head disposed between said breakneck groove and locking section having an outer diameter equal to or greater than the outer diameter of said locking section; aligning the holes through said members; assembling the fastener by inserting the mandrel stem through said sleeve tubular portion until said mandrel head abuts said sleeve tubular portion second end and said stem protrudes beyond said flange; inserting the fastener mandrel head and sleeve tubular portion into the holes through said members; placing a powered fastener installation device nosepiece about the mandrel stem and against said flange; gripping the mandrel stem with the powered fastener installation device; simultaneously pulling the mandrel stem axially away from the workpiece and compressing the sleeve axially toward the workpiece; upsetting the sleeve tubular portion; compressing the members; displacing material from the sleeve into the locking groove and against the shoulder; and breaking the mandrel stem at the breakneck groove.
