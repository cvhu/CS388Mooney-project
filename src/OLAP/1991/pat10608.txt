The station comprises a revolving table for receiving, positioning and clamping in an operating position a pallet of the type provided with adjustable anchoring elements for components of clamping fixtures, a magazine for modular components of clamping fixtures and a robot capable of executing adjustment functions of the anchoring elements of pallet, of the clamping and transfer of the modular components and of the application to and separation from the components themselves with respect to anchoring elements of pallet. There is provided a control centre with a computer, whereby just one operator may automatically and repetitively execute the work for the entire station.
Claims I claim: 1. Apparatus for assembling workpiece clamping fixtures to a workpiece support pallet and for disassembling said workpiece clamping fixtures from said workpiece support pallet, said apparatus comprising: a base pedestal; a table revolvably supported on said base pedestal; means for removably mounting on said table a pallet which has a support face provided with a two-dimensional array of adjustable anchoring elements; a magazine for storing a supply of clamping fixture modules demountably mountable directly or via one another to respective ones of said adjustable anchoring elements; a programmable robot having grasping organ means operating between said table and said magazine, for adjusting said adjustable anchoring elements, for grasping and transferring said clamping fixture modules between said magazine and said adjustable anchoring elements, and for applying said clamping fixture modules directly or indirectly to and separating said clamping fixture modules directly or indirectly from said adjustable anchoring elements; and a control center for programming said robot by example, to respetitively adjust anchoring elements and mount and demount clamping fixture modules to or from a succession or like pallets successively mounted on said table; said control center comprising an electronic computer operatively connected with said robot and arranged to be operated by a sole operator. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a device movably supported on said base for disengageable engagement with a workpiece when a workpiece is clamped by a plurality of said clamping fixture modules installed by said robot on a respective said pallet, for testing whether said workpiece is thereby securely clamped to said pallet. 3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein: said table is revolvably supported on said base pedestal by support means including: an inclinable part hinged by hinge means to said base pedestal for rotation about a horizontal axis; means for controlling rotation of said inclinable part about said horizontal axis; a rotatable part supported by said inclinable part for rotation about a vertical axis; control means for rotating said rotatable part; clamping means for clamping said rotatable part at a desired spatial disposition; an upper plate provided with guides for removably receiving and positioning a pallet; and means for clamping said upper plate and thereby a pallet received and positioned thereon, with respect to said rotatable part. 4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein: said magazine comprises at least one row of caissons having sliding drawers provided with handles arranged to be engaged by said grasping organ means of said robot for opening and closing respective ones of said drawers; and guide means provided between said drawers and said robot for allowing spatial movement between said robot and said drawers so that said robot may access a plurality of said drawers. 5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein: said robot comprises an operating device arranged to be moved along three mutually perpendicular axes and including a tubular casing; said grasping organ means including: a first tube-shaped grasping organ rotatably housed in said tubular casing and provided with protruding terminal grasping elements arranged to engage with said clamping fixture modules, and with first portions of said adjustable anchoring elements; a second finger-shaped grasping organ rotatably and axially slidably housed in said first tube-shaped grasping organ and provided with protrudable terminal grasping elements arranged to engage with second portions of said adjustable anchoring elements for adjusting said second portions relative to said second portions; and means for operating said first and second grasping organs. 6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein: said magazine comprises at lease one row of caissons having sliding drawers provided with handles arranged to be engaged by said grasping organ means of said robot for opening and closing respective ones of said drawers; guide means provided between said drawers and said robot for allowing spatial movement between said robot and said drawers so that said robot may access a plurality of said drawers; said robot comprises an operating device arranged to be moved along three mutually perpendicular axes and including a tubular casing; said grasping organ means including: a first tube-shaped grasping organ rotatably housed in said tubular casing and provided with protruding terminal grasping elements arranged to engage with said clamping fixture modules, and with first portions of said adjustable anchoring elements; a second finger-shaped grasping organ rotatably and axially slidably housed in said first tube-shaped grasping organ and provided with protrudable terminal grasping elements arranged to engage with second portions of said adjustable anchoring elements for adjusting said second portions relative to said second portions; said terminal grasping elements of said second finger-shaped grasping organ ar further configured for engaging said handles of said drawers for opening and closing said drawers; and means for operating said first and second grasping organs. 7. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a supply of said clamping fixture modules comprising at least one solid substantially cylindrical vertically oriented casing provided with a lower threaded tang arranged to be threaded into a respective said adjustable anchoring element. 8. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a supply of said clamping fixture modules comprising at least one hollow substantially cylindrical casing having a threaded tang arranged to be engaged in a respective said adjustable anchoring element; a piston slidably and rotatably housed in said hollow casing; a clamping bracket integral with said piston; elastic means for urging said piston towards a raised position corresponding to deactivation of said clamping bracket; hydraulic means operable by engagement one of said pallet and a said adjustable anchoring element, for displacing said piston to a lowered position corresponding to activation of said clamping bracket; and means for rotating said piston, and thereby said clamping bracket, upon axial displacement of said piston. 9. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a supply of said clamping fixture modules comprising at least one module arranged to clamp against a workpiece; and at least one intermediate module arranged to mount said one module to a respective said adjustable anchoring element.
