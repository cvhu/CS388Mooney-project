The present invention includes a method for deflashing unwanted material from manufactured articles and more particularly a method for deflashing rigid reaction injection molded articles The method includes the steps of providing a continuous flow of frozen pellets, providing a workpiece having flashing, directing the flow of frozen pellets at the flashing and the workpiece, and impacting the flashing and the workpiece with the frozen pellets.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for removing flashing from reaction injection molded articles, comprising the steps of: (a) providing a workpiece which has been formed by reaction injection molding, said workpiece having a surface and having a flashing, said flashing being connected to said workpiece along an edge of said workpiece; (b) providing a substantially continuous flow of carbon dioxide pellets while controlling the density of said carbon dioxide pellets so as to prevent degradation of said surface of said workpiece, said carbon dioxide pellets being generally cylindrical in shape, said carbon dioxide pellets being made of compressed carbon dioxide snow flakes which have been extruded through a die; and (c) directing said flow of carbon dioxide pellets at said workpiece along said edge so as to impact both said workpiece and said flashing and to cause said flashing to become disconnected from said workpiece at said edge.
