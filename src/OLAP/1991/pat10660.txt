A method and apparatus for automatically loading a cargo compartment of a vehicle is disclosed that maximizes the utilization of available space within the vehicle by determining an optimum load configuration based on various parameters of the vehicle and the containers to be loaded. A self-propelled robot loader is used to load the cargo compartment based on the determined optimum load configuration. The robot loader automatically withdraws from the cargo compartment as the loading is completed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot loader apparatus comprising: a movable carriage; a receiving station on said movable carriage configured to receive containers to be manipulated; and a loader on said movable carriage, said loader comprising: spaced vertical support members; a beam defining a pivot axis between said support members, said beam being mounted for movement vertically along said support members; and a robot arm mounted on said beam to pick up said containers from said receiving station and load said containers into a cargo compartment, said robot arm being mounted for pivoting movement about said pivot axis between said vertical support members and translational movement vertically with said beam between said support members, such that said robot arm can pick up said containers from a first location at said receiving station and rotate about said pivot axis to carry said containers through an arc to a second location. 2. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said robot arm is telescopic. 3. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said robot arm is mounted on said self-propelled robot loader to provide three-dimensional movement of said robot arm. 4. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said robot loader further includes non-contact distance sensor mounted on the sides of said robot loader.
