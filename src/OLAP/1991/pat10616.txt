The present invention relates generally to a new carrier for holding and transporting semiconductor products, and more specifically, to a versatile product carrier for holding and transporting a plurality of products, such as, ceramic substrates, green sheets, wafers, glass and/or metal masks, rigid or floppy disks, to name a few. The modular or versatile product carrier usually has two symmetrical cross-bars and two symmetrical end plates. The two cross-bars securely link into the end plates thereby forming the versatile product carrier of this invention. A cover that can be used to cover the versatile product carrier is also disclosed.
