In the case where lap fillet welding is carried out by a conventional arc welding robot, when a weld wire is once departed towards an upper plate, the wire keeps being away from a weld line, and therefore, various teaching techniques so as to prevent such a departure have been re-required. In the case where a weld line is long, if the wire is departed, a defective weld length becomes long, thus posing an significant problem. The present invention provides a control method for an arc sensor by detection of a weld current. That is, a departure of a lap fillet weld towards an upper plate is prevented merely by addition of a detection algorithm, teaching can be simplified and practical merits are great.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of correcting the travel path of an oscillating robotic welding torch, said robotic welding torch tracing a groove line defined by an upper and lower plate and oscillating laterally relative said groove line to define a center of oscillation and opposite first and second ends of oscillation, said fist end of oscillation extending towards the upper plate and said second end of oscillation extending towards the lower plate, said robotic welding torch having a welding current which has a value related to a distance between the robotic welding torch and the upper and lower plate, said method comprising the steps of: extracting a current component signal of the welding current having a frequency which is twice an oscillating frequency of the robotic welding torch; and, determining a travel path adjustment of the robotic vehicle according to a phase deviation between the current component signal and an oscillating frequency signal of the oscillating robotic welding torch. 2. A method as recited in claim 1, further comprising the step of adjusting the travel path of the robotic vehicle towards the lower plate when said phase deviation is substantially equal to one-quarter wavelength of the oscillating frequency signal.
