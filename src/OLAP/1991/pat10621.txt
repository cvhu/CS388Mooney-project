A position encoder for monitoring the position of a robot arm includes an incremental encoder section which can be initialized locally by an initialization section. The initialization section comprises three engaged encoder gears with relative prime number of teeth, e.g., 23, 24 and 25, so that respective index apertures of the gears precess with successive revolutions of the gears. Upon startup, the robot arm can be moved sufficiently for all three apertures to be detected so that their relative phase positions can be determined. The relative phases can be used to determine an absolute initialization position. Once this initialization position is determined, robot motions can be tracked using the incremental encoder section.
