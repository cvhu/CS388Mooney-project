An electrical connector for a manual welding machine includes first and second contacts each having a frustoconical surface thereon engageable with one another for carrying high amperage current between the first and second contacts; one of the contacts connects to a kickless cable and the other of the contacts connects to a welding head; the contacts include a self-contained lockup mechanism concentrically within the first and second contacts for pulling the contacts together as they are initially mated to impose an amplified axial force therebetween which is amplified further in a direction transverse to the axial force to produce a contact pressure between the frustoconical surfaces of the first and second contacts of a magnitude to assure low resistance flow of high amperage welding current.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A quick disconnect/connect electrical connector for an interchangeable robotic welding head having power supplied thereto from a power transformer and a kickless cable characterized by: first and second contacts each having a frustoconical surface for carrying current therebetween; means for electrically connecting one of said contacts to a power source; means for electrically connecting another of said first and second contacts to a welding unit; and self-contained lockup means on said first and second contacts for generating a lockup force between said first and second contacts with a significant mechanical advantage independent of the contour of said frustoconical surfaces, said lockup means being operative when said frustoconical surfaces of said first and second contacts are initially mated to cause said frustoconical surfaces to be drawn axially together into a nonrotatable interface and for directing a contact force therebetween to impose a lateral contact pressure therebetween of a magnitude to direct high amperage welding current flow thereacross with minimal resistance and minimal heat generation. 2. The electrical connector of claim 1, characterized by: means for moving said first and second contacts into initial alignment; means for laterally aligning said first and second contacts following the initial alignment therebetween; and said lockup means including ball means on one of said contacts and a piston rod means on the other of said contacts engageable only following initial alignment and lateral alignment of said first and second contacts and operative when engaged to impose a mechanical force coupling on said frustoconical surfaces. 3. The electrical connector of claim 1, characterized by: one of said first and second contacts being a female contact and the other of said first and second contacts being a male contact; means forming a plurality of female receptacle means on said male contact and means forming a plurality of male extensions on said female contact selectively engageable with said plurality of female receptacle means to first laterally align said first and second contacts as said frustoconical surfaces initially mate and to thereafter impose a mechanical force coupling on said frustoconical surfaces when they are fully mated and seated. 4. The electrical connector of claim 3, characterized by: said means forming a plurality of male extensions including a shell member having a plurality of lockup balls therein and a shield covering said shell member when said first and second contacts are separated; said means forming a plurality of female receptacle means including a lockup bushing on said male contact for displacing said shield when said first and second contacts are properly aligned and mated so as to cause said lockup balls to be exposed for engagement with said lockup bushing; and lock means for retaining said lockup balls in a position with respect to said lockup bushing for maintaining a multiplied axial force on said frustoconical surfaces which is further multiplied by the angle of said frustoconical surfaces. 5. The electrical connector of claim 4, characterized by: said lock means including a piston rod centered within said balls for forcing said balls into and out of said shell member; means including a piston for moving said piston rod into a first position in which the balls are retracted into said shell member and into a second position in which the balls are extended from said shell member.
