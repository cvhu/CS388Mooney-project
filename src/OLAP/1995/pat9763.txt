A three-axis robot is described comprising a first horizontally disposed support having a first carriage selectively movably mounted thereon. A second support is operatively secured to the first carriage and extends transversely from the longitudinal axis of the first support. A second carriage is longitudinally movably mounted on the second support and has a third support selectively vertically movably mounted thereon. Through the use of belts and brakes, the second support may be selectively moved relative to the first support and the third support may be selectively vertically moved relative to the second support. Thus, one axis of drive actuation can provide multiple axes of motion.
Claims I claim: 1. A three-axis Cartesian robot, comprising, a first, elongated horizontally disposed support means having first and second ends, a first carriage longitudinally movably mounted on said first support means, a selectively reversible drive motor means mounted on said first end of said first support means and having a horizontally rotatable drive shaft having its axis of rotation disposed transversely to the longitudinal axis of said support means, a first pulley means mounted on said drive shaft, a first idler pulley mounted on said second end of said first support means, an angle drive means mounted on said first carriage, said angle drive means including an input shaft and an output shaft having pulleys mounted thereon, a first belt means extending around and between said first pulley means and said first idler pulley, said first belt means also being operatively connected to said input shaft of said angle drive means, a traverse brake means for selectively preventing longitudinal movement of said first carriage with respect to said first support means; said drive motor, when driving in a first direction, with said traverse brake means being disengaged, causing said carriage to move towards said first end of said first support means, said drive motor, when driven in a second direction, with said traverse brake means being disengaged, causing said first carriage to move towards said second end of said first support means, said drive motor, when driven in said first or second directions, with said traverse brake means being engaged, causing said input shaft of said angle drive means to be rotated in first and second directions respectively, as second elongated and horizontally disposed support means secured to and extending from said first carriage in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of said first support means, said second support means having inner and out ends, a second carriage longitudinally movably mounted on said second support means, a second idler pulley rotatably mounted, about a horizontal axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of said second support means, at the outer end of said second support means, a third vertically disposed support means vertically movably mounted on said second carriage, a second belt means extending around and between the pulley on the said output shaft of said angle drive means and said second idler pulley means, first and second horizontally spaced apart carriage pulleys mounted on said second carriage above the axis of rotation of said second idler pulley, third and fourth, horizontally spaced apart carriage pulleys, mounted on said second carriage below the axis of rotation of said second idler pulley, a first carriage idler pulley means on said third support means above said first and second carriage pulleys, a second carriage idler pulley means on said third support means below said third and fourth carriage pulleys, said second belt means extending from said angle drive output shaft pulley, then beneath said first carriage pulley, thence upwardly therefrom, thence over and around said first carriage idler pulley means, thence downwardly, thence beneath and around said second carriage pulley, thence around said second idler pulley, thence over and around said fourth carriage pulley, thence downwardly, thence around and beneath said second carriage idler pulley means, thence upwardly, then around and over said third carriage idler pulley, thence beneath and around said pulley on said output shaft of said angle drive, a vertical brake means on said second carriage means for selective braking engagement with said second belt means adjacent said first carriage pulley, a horizontal brake means on said second carriage means for selectively braking engagement with said second belt means adjacent said third carriage pulley, the lower end of said third support means adapted to have means operatively connected thereto for manipulation of a workpiece, control means for controlling the operation of said drive motor means, traverse brake, vertical brake and horizontal brake. 2. The robot of claim 1 wherein an anchor brake is mounted on said second carriage means for selective braking engagement with said second belt means.
