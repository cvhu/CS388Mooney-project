The present invention is an improved printed circuit board test system in which test probes are positioned to electronically engage a selected device or printed circuit board section on a printed circuit board for testing the printed circuit board for manufacturing defects. The printed circuit board test system uses a bed-of-nails test fixture to ground and excite predetermined sites on a first side of the printed circuit board and a robot to mechanically position test probe(s) at selected test sites on a second side of the printed circuit board. A controller is used to control the movement of the robotic tester and the selection of spring probes in the bed-of-nails fixture to be exited, grounded or measured.
