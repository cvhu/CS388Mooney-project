A rack for supporting and accurately positioning rolls of web material (16-24) comprises a base member (10) having an upper surface (12) on which a plurality of support members (14, 26-32) are mounted by a plurality of individually removable brackets (34-40), the support members engaging axially extending ends (24) of the cores (18) of the rolls. A fixture (48-72, 88, 90) and method for assembling such a rack are described.
Claims Having thus described our invention in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use it, we claim as new and desire to secure Letters Patent for: 1. A method for assembling a rack for supporting a plurality of objects, each of said objects having an axis and opposite ends located on said axis, each of said ends having a portion extending axially beyond the body of said object, said rack including a base member having an upper surface; a plurality of support members, one more in number than said plurality of objects, each support member having an upper end and a lower end, each said upper end comprising means configured for supporting a respective one of said ends of one of said objects or for supporting a pair of said ends of a respective adjacent pair of said objects, with said axes of said plurality of objects being colinear; and a plurality of mounting members for individually mounting said lower ends to said base member and thereby positioning said plurality of support members to support said plurality of objects, said method comprising the steps of: providing a platform for supporting said base member; providing an elongated jig having an exterior geometry which simulates the geometry of said colinear objects where said objects contact said means configured for supporting; positioning said elongated jig above said platform; positioning said base member, having said mounting members thereon onto on said platform; mounting each of said lower ends of said support members in a respective one of said mounting members; raising said base member to a position in which said means configured for supporting loosely engage said elongated jig; raising said lower ends within said mounting members and holding said support members such that a respective interstitial space is defined between each of said lower ends and each of said respective mounting members; applying adhesive to said interstitial spaces to adhesively secure said lower ends to said mounting members; and lowering said base member to disengage said means configured for supporting from said elongated jig. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein said holding is accomplished by securing each said support member to said elongated jig before adhesively securing said lower ends. 3. A method according to claim 2, wherein said securing each said support member is accomplished by attaching a plurality of respective spring means to the respective upper ends of said support members to thereby attach said support members to the respective portions of said elongated jig.
