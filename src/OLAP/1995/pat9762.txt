A susceptor carrying semiconductor wafers for processing is suspended from a compliant attachment at its upper end and is lowered into a reaction chamber for processing. At the completion of processing, the susceptor is withdrawn vertically to permit a robot to unload the processed wafers and load unprocessed wafers. In order to fix the position of the susceptor during the loading operations, a support carriage is moved into position to engage the lower end of the susceptor. Noxious and corrosive chloride vapors are simultaneously withdrawn from the reaction chamber by a vacuum line attached to the support carriage.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for handling and supporting semiconductor substrates comprising: a. compliantly supporting a vertically oriented susceptor from the top end thereof; b. stabilizing said susceptor vertically from the bottom end thereof by engaging said bottom end with a plurality of frictionally engageable contact pads so that there is no lateral movement between said pads and said bottom end that can generate particulates; and c. loading or unloading substrates from said susceptor while it is stabilized. 2. A method according to claim 1 wherein said frictionally engageable contact pads are mounted on a movable platform that can move said contact pads into frictional engagement with the bottom of the susceptor. 3. A method according to claim 2 wherein the susceptor has multiple sides for supporting substrates and the stabilizing contact pads mounted on said moveable platform are maintained in frictional engagement with the bottom of the susceptor during the loading and unloading of substrates; with the proviso that during rotation of the susceptor to present a different side for the loading or unloading of substrates thereon, said platform is moved away from said susceptor, thereby releasing said contact pads to allow said susceptor rotation.
