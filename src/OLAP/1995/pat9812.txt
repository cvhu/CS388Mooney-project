An apparatus and method for aligning an automated semiconductor wafer handling device with a semiconductor wafer receiving device. An alignment head is attached to the semiconductor wafer handling device in place of a wafer gripper assembly. The alignment head has at least one dial indicator disposed thereon. The ends of the dial indicators are arranged such that they are located in the same position a semiconductor wafer would occupy during normal operation of the automated semiconductor wafer handling device. As the automated semiconductor wafer handling device is activated, the alignment head is brought within close proximity to the semiconductor wafer receiving device. In so doing, the ends of the dial pins contact the surface of the semiconductor wafer receiving device thereby indicating the relative position and alignment of the automated semiconductor wafer handling device with respect to the semiconductor wafer receiving device. In a similar manner, the alignment head also indicates the relative position of the automated semiconductor wafer handling device with respect to a semiconductor wafer dispersing device.
