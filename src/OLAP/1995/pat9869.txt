A robot in the form of a toy simulating a spider is provided wherein the robot is capable of maintaining balance while walking, turning and running in a race-type setting on level ground and over a ramp or small obstacles. A preferrred embodiment of the robot has four operatively cooperating legs which are remotely controlled by a motor on each of the left side and the right side of the robot. A gear reduction mechanism to improve torque is considered. The operative cooperating legs are designed such that alternate legs on each side are in a DOWN position when mirrored legs are in a DOWN position, thereby providing balance while walking with four of the eight legs in a DOWN position while remaining legs are in an UP position.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A toy simulating a walking spider, wherein the toy comprises: a frame having a left side and a right side; a left plurality of cooperatively rotating interconnected gears attached to said left side of said frame, and a right plurality of cooperatively rotating interconnected gears attached to said right side of said frame, wherein a first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears is positioned to operatively cooperate with an adjacent second gear, such that rotation of said first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears about a first axis in a first direction urges the rotation of said adjacent second gear about a second axis in a second opposing direction; a left plurality of jointed spider legs attached to said left plurality of gears, and a right plurality of jointed spider legs attached to said right plurality of gears, wherein each jointed spider leg comprises: a main arm having an innermost portion and an outermost portion with a joint bracket supported by and extending from said outermost portion of said main arm; a secondary arm having an innermost portion and an outermost portion, wherein said secondary arm is pivotally attached to said main arm joint bracket at a predetermined distance from said innermost portion of said secondary arm; support beam means for supporting said main arm at a predetermined distance from said innermost portion of said main arm, wherein said support beam means is attached to said frame, and said support beam means is additionally attached to said innermost portion of said secondary arm thereby to be multi-dimensionally pivotable upon said secondary arm; wherein said innermost portion of said main arm of a first jointed spider leg in each of said left and right plurality of jointed spider legs is attached to a first predetermined position on said first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears, and said innermost portion of said main arm of a second jointed spider leg in each of said left and right plurality of jointed spider legs is attached to a third gear, which third gear is separated by said adjacent second gear, to a second predetermined position on said third gear, which second predetermined position is different than said first predetermined position, such that said first and second predetermined positions urge said first jointed spider leg in each of said left and right plurality of jointed spider legs into an up position when said second jointed spider leg in each of said left and right plurality of jointed spider legs is urged into a down position; and motor means for driving said first gear of said left and right pluralities of gears in said first direction, thereby to rotate said adjacent second gear. 2. The toy as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears further comprises: an axle aligned according to said first axis, about which axle said first gear rotates. 3. The toy as claimed in claim 2, wherein said motor means is a motor with a drive shaft mounted to said axle, thereby to rotate said axle and said first gear. 4. A toy simulating a walking spider, wherein the toy comprises: a frame having a left side and a right side; a left plurality of gears attached to said left side of said frame, and a right plurality of gears attached to said right side of said frame, wherein a first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears is positioned to operatively cooperate with an adjacent second gear, such that rotation of said first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears about a first axis in a first direction urges the rotation of said adjacent second gear about a second axis in a second opposing direction; a left plurality of jointed spider legs attached to said left plurality of gears, and a right plurality of jointed spider legs attached to said right plurality of gears, wherein each jointed spider leg comprises: a main arm having an innermost portion and an outermost portion with a joint bracket supported by and extending from said outermost portion of said main arm; a secondary arm having an innermost portion and an outermost portion, wherein said secondary arm is pivotally attached to said main arm joint bracket at a predetermined distance from said innermost position of said secondary arm; support beam means for supporting said main arm at a predetermined distance from said innermost portion of said main arm, wherein said support beam means is attached to said frame, and said support beam means is additionally attached to said innermost portion of said secondary arm thereby to be multi-dimensionally pivotable upon said secondary arm; wherein said left plurality of jointed spider legs is attached to alternating gears of said left plurality of gears, and said right plurality of jointed spider legs is attached to alternating gears of said right plurality of gears, in a first set of predetermined gear positions that thereby urge alternating jointed spider legs from said left and right plurality of jointed spider legs into an up position when a second set of jointed spider legs from said left and right plurality of jointed spider legs is urged into a down position; and driving means for driving said first gear of said left and right pluralities of gears in said first direction, thereby to rotate said adjacent second gear in said second opposing direction. 5. The toy as claimed in claim 4, wherein said first gear in each of said left and right plurality of gears further comprises: an axle aligned according to said first axis, about which axle said first gear rotates. 6. The toy as claimed in claim 5, wherein said driving means is a motor with a drive shaft mounted to said axle, thereby to rotate said axle and said first gear.
