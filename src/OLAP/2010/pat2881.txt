A system, method, or apparatus provides information relating to at least some tissue-based matter or bone-based matter of an individual responsive to an X-ray applied to the at least some tissue-based matter or bone-based matter. In one approach, the system, method or apparatus determines information at least in part from Compton scattering principles. In one approach, the information can correspond to a range of depths or can indicate depth of features or scattering events. In one approach, the information is responsive to a determined change in direction and/or energy state of photons undergoing Compton scattering.
