A robotic control system is placed in clutch mode so that a slave manipulator holding a surgical instrument is temporarily disengaged from control by a master manipulator in order to allow manual positioning of the surgical instrument at a surgical site within a patient. Control systems implemented in a processor compensate for internally generated frictional and inertial resistance experienced during the positioning, thereby making movement more comfortable to the mover, and stabler from a control standpoint. Each control system drives a joint motor in the slave manipulator with a saturated torque command signal which has been generated to compensate for non-linear viscous forces, coulomb friction, cogging effects, and inertia forces subjected to the joint, using estimated joint angular velocities, accelerations and externally applied torques generated by an observer in the control system from sampled displacement measurements received from a sensor associated with the joint.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic surgical system comprising: a master manipulator; a slave manipulator having a plurality of jointed structures for providing multiple degrees of freedom movement to a surgical instrument when coupled to the slave manipulator, a plurality of motors to drive movement of the plurality of jointed structures, and a plurality of sensors to measure movement of corresponding of a plurality of joints of the plurality of jointed structures; a master/slave control system configured to control movement of the slave manipulator in response to manipulation of the master manipulator; at least one control system configured to generate a signal by processing measurements received from a corresponding one of the plurality of sensors to drive a corresponding one of the plurality of motors so as to reduce effects of internally generated frictional and inertial resistance when at least a portion of the slave manipulator is manually moved in order to position or orientate the surgical instrument at a surgical site within a patient; and a switch to engage the master/slave control system and disengage the at least one control system when the switch is in a first state and to disengage the master/slave control system and engage the at least one control system when the switch is in a second state. 2. The robotic surgical system according to claim 1, further comprising a switch activating mechanism disposed on the slave manipulator so as to allow a user proximate to the slave manipulator to interact with the switch activating mechanism to place the switch in the first and second states. 3. The robotic surgical system according to claim 2, wherein the switch activating mechanism is implemented by a button provided on the slave manipulator. 4. In a robotic surgical system including a master manipulator, a slave manipulator, a master/slave control system for controlling movement of the slave manipulator in response to movement of the master manipulator, the slave manipulator coupled to a surgical instrument and having a plurality of joints, a plurality of motors driving the joints, and a plurality of sensors for detecting motion of the joints; the improvement comprising: a slave manipulator control system including an observer coupled to one of the sensors and configured to estimate a velocity and acceleration of the joint corresponding to the sensor, and a signal generator configured to generate a signal to drive the motor corresponding to the joint using the estimate of the velocity and acceleration of the joint, so as to reduce internally generated frictional and inertial resistance when manually moving at least a portion of the slave manipulator in order to position or orientate the surgical instrument; and a user operable switch to engage the master/slave control system and disengage the slave manipulator control system when the switch is in a first state, and to disengage the master/slave control system and engage the slave manipulator control system when the switch is in a second state.
