A standard memory module socket is removed from a target DRAM module slot on the component side and the test adaptor board connects to the target DRAM module slot on the reverse (solder) side of a personal computer motherboard, or an extender card may be used. The target DRAM module slot is a middle slot, such as the second or third of four DRAM module slots. The first and fourth DRAM module slots are populated with known good memory modules storing the BIOS at a high address and an operating system image and a test program at a low address. The test program accesses a memory chip in a test socket on a test adaptor board that is connected to the target DRAM module slot to locate defects. The motherboard does not crash since the BIOS, OS image, and test program are not stored in the memory chip under test.
