A printhead assembly for a pagewidth printer arrangement includes a channel shaped member. A number of printhead tiles are located in the channel shaped member. Each tile has a printhead integrated circuit (IC) carrier member for receiving a printhead IC and an ink ducting member that mates with the carrier member and defines ink ducts for supplying the printhead IC with ink via the carrier member.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly for a pagewidth printer arrangement, the printhead assembly comprising a channel shaped member; and a number of printhead tiles located in the channel shaped member, each tile comprising a printhead integrated circuit (IC) carder member for receiving a printhead IC; and an ink ducting member that mates with the carrier member and defines ink ducts for supplying the printhead IC with ink via the carrier member, wherein the carrier member is a first molding that defines a channel in which the associated printhead IC is received. 2. A printhead assembly as claimed in claim 1, in which the first molding has raised ribs on one side of the channel for guiding paper past the printhead IC. 3. A printhead assembly as claimed in claim 1, in which the ink ducting member is a second molding, the first and second moldings defining a stepped recess portion at a midpoint of the molding, the channel shaped member having a snap release mechanism that engages the tiles at the stepped recess portions.
