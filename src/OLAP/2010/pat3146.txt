The present invention comprises methods for the treatment of central nervous system diseases and disorders including mood disorders and sleep disorders through the administration of compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) ##STR00001## which are useful as inhibitors of human casein kinase I.epsilon.. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of formula (I) or formula (II) as well as methods for their preparation are also disclosed and claimed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1.

A method for treating a patient suffering from a sleep disorder ameliorated through the inhibition of casein kinase I.epsilon. activity comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or formula (II), ##STR00029## wherein X is S or S(O).sub.n; R.sub.1 is H or C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl; R.sub.2 is NR.sub.5R.sub.6; R.sub.3 is aryl or heterocycle; R.sub.4 is H, C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl, C.sub.2-C.sub.6alkenyl, C.sub.2-C.sub.6alkynyl, aryl-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl), heterocycle-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl), C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkoxy, aryl-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkoxy), heterocycle-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkoxy), CF.sub.3, halogen, SH, C.sub.1-6alkylthio, aryl-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkylthio), heterocycle-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkylthio), NO.sub.2, NH.sub.2, NR.sub.5R.sub.5, aryl-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkylamino), heterocycle-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkylamino), or XR.sub.3 wherein X and R.sub.3 are as defined above; R.sub.5 is H or C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl; R.sub.6 is H or C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl; L is N or CR.sub.7 wherein R.sub.7 is H or C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl; M is S, O or NR.sub.8 wherein R.sub.8 is H, C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl, aryl-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl), heterocycle-(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl) or acyl; and n is 1 or 2; or an enantiomer, tautomer or a racemate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein the sleep disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. 4. The method of claim 3 wherein the circadian rhythm sleep disorder is a shift work sleep disorder, jet lag syndrome, advanced sleep phase syndrome or a delayed sleep phase syndrome. 5. A method for treating a patient suffering from a sleep disorder ameliorated through the inhibition of casein kinase I.epsilon. activity comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of formula (I) or formula (II) as recited in claim 1 or an enantiomer, racemate, tautomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
