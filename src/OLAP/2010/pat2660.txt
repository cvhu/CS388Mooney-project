A system for performing minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The system includes a pair of surgical instruments that are coupled to a pair of robotic arms. The instruments have end effectors that can be manipulated to hold and suture tissue. The robotic arms are coupled to pair of master handles by a controller. The handles can be moved by the surgeon to produce a corresponding movement of the end effectors. The controller controls and limits movement of robotic arms relative to the patient.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method implemented in a controller for operating a medical robotic system, comprising: receiving information from a first set of sensors indicating sensed movement of an input device; commanding a robotic arm to move a surgical instrument about a pivot point in response to the received information indicating sensed movement of the input device; receiving information from a second set of sensors indicating sensed movement of the robotic arm; determining whether the pivot point moves more than a threshold value using the received information indicating sensed movement of the robotic arm; and commanding the robotic arm to stop movement of the surgical instrument about the pivot point if the pivot point moves more than the threshold value. 2. A method implemented in a controller for operating a medical robotic system, comprising: receiving information from a first set of sensors indicating sensed movement of an input device; commanding a robotic arm to move a surgical instrument about a pivot point in response to the received information indicating sensed movement of the input device; receiving information from a second set of sensors indicating sensed movement of the robotic arm; determining whether the pivot point moves more than a threshold value using the received information indicating sensed movement of the robotic arm; and issuing a warning if the pivot point moves more than the threshold value.
