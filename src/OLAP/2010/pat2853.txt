A rotary file includes: (a) a body having first and second ends, and an outer surface comprising at least one cutting edge; (b) a shank extending from the first end of the body which is adapted to be mounted in a rotary tool; and (c) a pilot extending from the second end of the body, the pilot defining an annular peripheral surface with an arcuate cross-section.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of removing one or more burrs from a peripheral edge of a machined feature in a workpiece, comprising: (a) providing a deburring tool having a rotatable spindle which is resiliently deflectable away from a nominal axis of rotation; (b) mounting a rotary file in the spindle, the rotary file comprising: (i) a body having first and second ends, and an outer surface comprising at least one cutting edge; (ii) a shank extending from the first end of the body which is mounted in the spindle; and (iii) a pilot extending from the second end of the body, the pilot defining an annular peripheral surface having an arcuate cross-section as viewed in a cutting plane parallel to a rotational axis of the rotary file; and (c) spinning the rotary file while simultaneously traversing the rotary file along a preprogrammed toolpath which describes a preselected amount of interference between the rotary file and the workpiece, such that the pilot contacts a first portion of the workpiece while the at least one cutting edge cuts the one or more burrs; (d) wherein the toolpath is programmed to continuously maintain the spindle in position deflected away from the nominal axis of rotation throughout the deburring procedure. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein a restoring force is applied to the spindle urging the spindle towards a nominal position, the restoring force being of sufficient magnitude to ensure removal of the largest observed burr from the peripheral edge. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein the tool is moved so as to machine a chamfer on the peripheral edge. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the toolpath is programmed solely with reference to a nominal shape of the machined feature.
