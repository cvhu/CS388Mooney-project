A mixer-extruder assembly may include a hollow cylindrical chamber and a hopper connected to the chamber. A piston drive shaft having a piston attached at one end may be rotatable about a drive shaft axis that is coaxial with the cylindrical chamber. The piston may have one or more mixer blades coupled thereto and rotatable therewith. The piston may be controllably rotated about the drive shaft axis, after input material received by the hopper is delivered into the chamber, causing the mixer blades to rotate and mix the input material with mixing fluid introduced into the chamber. The piston may also be slidably movable from an upper end of the chamber toward the outlet port of the chamber, so that the mixed input material is extruded through the output port of the chamber.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mixer-extruder assembly for mixing powdered concrete with a fluid and forcibly extruding the mixture therefrom comprising: a mixing chamber having an inlet end and an opposing outlet end; a powdered concrete inlet port configured to inject powdered concrete into the mixing chamber at a location that is near the inlet end; a fluid inlet port configured to inject fluid into the mixing chamber at a location that is near the inlet end; a mixture outlet port configured to extrude a mixture of powdered concrete and fluid from within the mixing chamber at a location that is near the outlet end; at least one mixing blade configured to effectively mix the powdered concrete with the fluid by rotating within the mixing chamber about a rotational axis, the at least one mixing blade being substantially straight and extending longitudinally substantially between the inlet and the outlet ends of the mixing chamber; a piston configured to controllably extrude the mixture of powdered concrete and fluid from within the mixing chamber through the outlet port by moving longitudinally along the rotational axis between the inlet and the outlet ends of the mixing chamber, the piston having: a size which allows the piston when in a retracted position to completely fit within the space between the inlet ports and the inlet end of the hollow chamber, thereby allowing powdered concrete and fluid to be injected into the mixing chamber from the inlet ports while the piston is in the retracted position; and at least one slot through which the at least one mixing blade slides, the at least one slot being configured to allow the piston to slide along the length of the at least one mixing blade while moving between the inlet and outlet ends of the chamber, without allowing a substantial amount of the mixture of powdered concrete and fluid to pass through the at least one slot, thereby enabling the piston to push out the mixture within the immediate vicinity of the mixing blade; and a drive shaft configured when rotated to cause the at least one mixing blade to rotate and when translated to cause the piston to move substantially between the inlet and the outlet ends of the chamber, whereby the mixing blade, the piston, and the drive shaft are configured such that the mixture is mixed by the mixing blade and extruded by the piston simultaneously. 2. A mixer-extruder assembly for mixing powdered concrete with a fluid and forcibly extruding the mixture therefrom comprising: a mixing chamber configured to contain the powdered concrete and the fluid while the powdered concrete and the fluid are being mixed; a mixer configured to controllably mix the powdered concrete with the fluid within the mixing chamber through rotational movement about an axis; a piston configured to controllably extrude the mixture of powdered concrete and fluid from within the mixing chamber by moving longitudinally with respect to the mixer along the rotational axis, thereby enabling the piston to push out the mixture within the vicinity of the mixing blade; and a shaft connected to the piston configured to controllably move the piston longitudinally along the rotational axis and to rotate the piston about the rotational axis, wherein the piston is further configured to transfer rotational movement that is imparted to the piston to the mixer so as to cause the mixer to rotate, whereby the mixer is driven by the piston. 3. The mixer-extruder assembly of claim 2 wherein the piston includes one or more slots which slidably engage the mixer that are configured to transfer rotational movement that is imparted to the piston to the mixer so as to cause the mixer to rotate and to allow the piston to slide longitudinally with respect to the mixer along the rotational axis.
