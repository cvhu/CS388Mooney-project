A vehicle axle joint for a toy vehicle is described and which includes a socket portion; and a ball portion which matingly cooperates with the socket portion, and which defines a gear cavity, and wherein the ball portion may be selectively oriented relative to the socket portions so as to allow hobbyists to construct a multitude of toy vehicles.
Claims We claim: 1. A toy vehicle with an axle, comprising: a vehicle frame having a longitudinal and transverse axis; a motor mounted on the vehicle frame; a drive shaft oriented along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle frame, and which has a first end which is mechanically coupled to the motor and an opposite second end; a gear assembly mechanically coupled to the second end of the drive shaft, and wherein the gear assembly is moveably adjustable only in a vertical plane relative to the vehicle frame; an axle mounted on the vehicle frame and which is mechanically coupled to the gear assembly, and wherein the axle is located substantially parallel to the transverse axis of the vehicle frame and is not moveable in a horizontal plane relative to the vehicle frame; an adjustable ball portion defining a gear cavity that encloses the gear assembly and further receives and cooperates with both the second end of the drive shaft, and the axle, and wherein the adjustable ball portion is adjustably moveable only in the vertical plane relative to the vehicle frame, and wherein the adjustable ball portion is immovable relative to the vehicle frame during the operation of the toy vehicle, and wherein the adjustable ball portion has an outside facing surface defining a peripheral edge, and wherein a plurality of gear teeth are defined by the peripheral edge; and a socket portion defining a housing which is releasably mounted on the vehicle frame but which is immovable in either the vertical or horizontal planes relative to the vehicle frame during the operation of the toy vehicle, and wherein the housing of the socket portion comprises two mirror image members which when brought together and assembled on the vehicle frame define a cavity therebetween which is sized so as to receive, and immovably orient the adjustable ball portion in a given position relative to the vehicle frame, and wherein the mirror image members of the housing must be separated from each other so as to permit the adjustable movement of the adjustable ball portion in the vertical plane relative to the vehicle frame, and wherein at least one of the mirror image members of the socket portion has a tooth which meshingly engages the plurality of gear teeth as defined by the adjustable ball portion so as to prohibit the vertical movement of the adjustable ball portion relative to the vehicle frame when the toy vehicle is in operation.
