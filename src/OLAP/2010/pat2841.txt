The present invention provides 6-modified bicyclic nucleoside analogs and oligomeric compounds comprising these nucleoside analogs. In preferred embodiments the nucleoside analogs have either (R) or (S)-chirality at the 6-position. These bicyclicnucleoside analogs are useful for enhancing properties of oligomeric compounds including nuclease resistance.
