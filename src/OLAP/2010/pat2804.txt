The compound of claim 1 which is 15 to 30 nucleobases in length. 3. The compound of claim 1 which is 20 nucleobases in length. 4. The compound of claim 1 having at least 95% complementarity with a nucleic acid molecule encoding human glucagon receptor having SEQ ID NO: 4. 5. The compound of claim 1 having at least one 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 1 having at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 7. The compound of claim 1 having at least one 5-methylcytosine. 8. The compound of claim 1 that is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. 9. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. 10. The compound of claim 1 comprising at least one high affinity modified sugar moiety selected from the group consisting of a 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl), a 2'-O-methyl or a locked nucleic acid. 11. The compound of claim 1 wherein the compound is chimeric, comprising deoxynucleotides in a gap region, at least one high affinity modified sugar in each of a first wing region, and a second wing region, said wing regions flanking the gap region on the 5' end and the 3' end, respectively, and at least one phosphorothioate modified internucleoside linkage. 12. The compound of claim 11 wherein the gap segment is ten deoxynucleotides in length, the first and second wing segments are each five nucleotides in length and comprise five 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) nucleotides, and each internucleoside linkage in the chimeric oligonucleotide is a phosphorothioate. 13. The compound of claim 1 wherein at least a portion of said compound hybridizes with RNA to form an oligonucleotide-RNA duplex. 14. The compound of claim 11 further comprising at least one 5-methylcytosine modified nucleobase. 15. The compound of claim 1 comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. 16. The compound of claim 1, wherein the compound targets and specifically hybridizes within nucleotides 442 to 490. 17. The compound of claim 1, wherein the compound targets and specifically hybridizes within nucleotides 493 to 521. 18. The compound of claim 1, wherein the compound targets and specifically hybridizes within nucleotides 588 to 646. 19.
