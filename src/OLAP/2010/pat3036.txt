It has now been found that certain novel N-(substituted aryl)-4-(disubstituted methyl)piperidine and pyridine derivatives have provided unexpected insecticidal activity. These compounds are represented by formula (I): wherein m, n, q, r, and s are independently selected from 0 or 1; and p is 0, 1, 2, or 3; A is C or CH; and B, D, E, R, R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, R.sup.6, R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 are fully described herein. In addition, compositions comprising an insecticidally effective amount of at least one compound of formula I, and optionally, an effective amount of at least one of a second compound, with at least one insecticidally compatible carrier are also disclosed; along with methods of controlling insects comprising applying said compositions to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound of formula I ##STR00096## wherein; p, q, and rare 0; s is 1; A is C forming 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine; R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, and R.sup.6 are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, and haloalkyl; B is phenyl substituted with R.sup.9, R.sup.10, R.sup.11, R.sup.12, and R.sup.13, ##STR00097## where R.sup.9, R.sup.10, R.sup.11, R.sup.12, and R.sup.13 are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, or haloalkyl; R.sup.8 is phenyl substituted with R.sup.22, R.sup.23, R.sup.24, R.sup.25, and R.sup.26, ##STR00098## where R.sup.22, R.sup.23, R.sup.25, and R.sup.26 are independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, or alkoxy; is an optionally substituted heteroaryloxy moiety; E is (CR.sup.27R.sup.28).sub.x--(CR.sup.29R.sup.30).sub.y; where x is 1; y is 0; and, where R.sup.27, R.sup.28, R.sup.29, and R.sup.30 are independently selected from hydrogen or alkyl; and agriculturally-acceptable salts thereof. 2. A compound of claim 1, wherein q is 0; r is 0; and s is 1; R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, and R.sup.6 are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, alkyl and haloalkyl; E is the bridging group --(CR.sup.27R.sup.28).sub.x--(CR.sup.29R.sup.30).sub.y--, where x is 1 and y is 0, R.sup.27 and R.sup.28 are hydrogen; and R.sup.8 is phenyl substituted with R.sup.22, R.sup.23, R.sup.25, and R.sup.26, where R.sup.22, R.sup.23, R.sup.25, and R.sup.26 are independently selected from hydrogen and alkoxy, and R.sup.24 is selected from optionally substituted pyridyloxy, optionally substituted pyrimidinyloxy, and optionally substituted pyridazinyloxy. 3. A composition comprising an insecticidally effective amount of a compound of claim 1 in admixture with at least one agriculturally acceptable extender or adjuvant. 4. A composition comprising an insecticidally effective amount of a compound of claim 2 in admixture with at least one agriculturally acceptable extender or adjuvant. 5. A method of controlling tobacco budworm, comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition of claim 3 to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present. 6. A method of controlling tobacco budworm, comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition of claim 4 to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present.
