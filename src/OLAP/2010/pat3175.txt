A robotic case packing system loads articles from a moving conveying system into a container. The system has a pivot drive shaft pivotally connected to a support frame for selective rotation about a selected axis of rotation and has a drive linkage operatively connected between a servo motor and to the pivot drive shaft to selectively pivot the pivot drive shaft. A two-axis-robot is mounted on the pivot drive shaft along the axis of rotation such that movement of the two-axis-robot along its two axes of movement occurs within planes substantially parallel to the axis of rotation. A controller operatively connected to the servo motor is used to selectively actuate the servo motor to rotate the pivot drive shaft in order to enable selective picking and placing of articles with the robotic case packing system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic case packing system for loading articles from a moving conveying system into a container, comprising: a product conveyor for conveying a plurality of articles along a selected line of motion; a case conveyor operatively disposed in relation to the product conveyor to deliver containers to a pre-selected location offset and horizontally beneath the line of motion of the product conveyor; a support frame; a servo motor connected to the support frame; a pivot drive shaft pivotally connected to the support frame and adapted for selective rotation about a selected axis of rotation; a drive linkage operatively connected between the servo motor and the pivot drive shaft to selectively rotate the pivot driveshaft about the axis of rotation upon selective actuation of the servo motor; a two-axis robot operatively mounted on the pivot drive shaft along the axis of rotation such that movement of the two-axis-robot along its two axes of movement occurs within planes substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the pivot drive shaft; wherein the frame is operatively positioned in relation to the product conveyor such that the axis of rotation of the pivot drive shaft is above and substantially parallel to the line of motion of the product conveyor; and a controller operatively connected to the servo motor for selectively actuating the servo motor to selectively rotate the pivot drive shaft in order to enable selective picking and placing of articles from the conveyor. 2. A robotic case packing system for loading articles from a product moving conveyor, having a known line of movement, into a container that is positioned offset from and horizontally beneath the line of movement of the product conveyor, comprising: a support frame; a servo motor connected to the support frame; a pivot drive shaft pivotally connected to the support frame and adapted for selective rotation about a selected axis of rotation; a drive linkage operatively connected between the servo motor and the pivot drive shaft to selectively rotate the pivot driveshaft about the axis of rotation upon selective actuation of the servo motor; a two-axis robot operatively mounted on the pivot drive shaft along the axis of rotation such that movement of the two-axis-robot along its two axes of movement occurs within planes substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the pivot drive shaft; and a controller operatively connected to the servo motor for selectively actuating the servo motor to selectively rotate the pivot drive shaft in order to enable selective picking and placing of articles from the conveyor, wherein the frame and the pivot drive shaft are operatively positionable in relation to the line of movement of the product conveyor such that the axis of rotation of the pivot drive shaft is above and substantially parallel to the line of motion of the product conveyor.
