Tactile Sensor. The sensor includes a compliant convex surface disposed above a sensor array, the sensor array adapted to respond to deformation of the convex surface to generate a signal related to an applied force vector. The applied force vector has three components to establish the direction and magnitude of an applied force. The compliant convex surface defines a dome with a hollow interior and has a linear relation between displacement and load including a magnet disposed substantially at the center of the dome above a sensor array that responds to magnetic field intensity.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Tactile sensor comprising: A compliant convex surface defining a dome with a hollow interior and having a linear relation between displacement of the convex surface and an applied force vector including a magnet disposed substantially at the center of the dome above a sensor array that responds to magnetic field intensity, the sensor array responding to deformation of the convex surface to generate a signal related to the applied force vector. 2. The sensor of claim 1 wherein the dome has a flat top and sides are sections of a sphere. 3. The sensor of claim 1 wherein the convex surface includes a magnet at its center and the sensor array includes at least 3 non-colinear sensors that respond to magnetic field intensity. 4. The sensor of claim 3 wherein the sensors are Hall effect sensors. 5. The sensor of claim 3 wherein the differences of the signals measured by the sensors relate to lateral displacement of the convex surface and the average of the signals relates to normal displacement. 6. The sensor of claim 1 including 4 sensors in the sensor array, wherein the sensor array is rectangular. 7. The sensor of claim 1 wherein the convex surface is silicone rubber. 8. The sensor of claim 1 wherein the dome is a spherical surface intersected by a cube.
