A method and device for storing and using information associated with multiple logical volumes stored on a single physical volume associated with a data storage system. The invention uses writable labels to read and write metadata associated with the multiple logical volumes. Metadata stored on a writable label associated with each physical volume is available without either reading the physical volume itself or accessing a host computer's control data set.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a multiple magnetic tape cartridge management system, a method for storing and tracking multiple logical volumes of data written on magnetic tape media of a single magnetic tape cartridge to reduce access time to the multiple logical volumes written on the magnetic tape media of the single magnetic tape cartridge, the consisting of: writing a first logical volume of data onto magnetic tape media of a single magnetic tape cartridge; recording information associated with said first logical volume including a first logical volume table of contents onto a writeable and readable label attached to outside of said single magnetic tape cartridge; writing a second volume of data onto the magnetic tape media of said single magnetic tape cartridge; recording information associated with said second logical volume including a second logical volume table of contents onto said label; recording information including a directory of said first and second logical volumes written on the magnetic tape media of said single magnetic tape cartridge onto said label; reading said information on said label to determine the multiple logical volumes, and the contents of each of the multiple logical volumes, written on the magnetic tape media of said single magnetic tape cartridge without loading said single magnetic tape cartridge and reading the multiple logical volumes from the magnetic tape media; and wherein said label includes an electromagnetic transponder and/or an optical media, said electromagnetic transponder and/or said optical media is configured to store data in an electromagnetic and/or optical format, having an areal density greater than three hundred and sixty (360) Kilobits per square inch.
