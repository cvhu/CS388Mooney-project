A lead-through robot programming system for programming a robot to drive an end effector through a series of desired path points along a desired path with respect to a workstation. The system includes a six DOF digitizing arm having a working end, an end effector model mounted to the working end, a workstation model, and a programming computer system. A user manipulates the working end to move the end effector model through a model path with respect to the workstation model. At selected model path points, the digitizing arm generates model path point data representing the position and orientation of the end effector model with respect to the workstation model. The programming computer system includes a video monitor, a user interface, and memory for storing data including the model path point data, robot simulation and motion program generation software, and models of the robot, workstation and end effector. The simulation and motion program generation software is run as a function of the model path point data to generate motion-control program segments that direct the robot to drive the end effector through the desired path. The simulation and motion program generation software also generates graphic images of the robot driving the end effector through the desired path. Interactively controlling the simulation and motion program generation software through the interface, and using visual feedback provided by the monitor, the user performs collision and out-of-range checking and singularity point identification, and optimizes the motion-control program segments.
