In an apparatus for operating a robotic device (1), preferably in minimally-invasive surgery and/or robotics, at least one movable robotic part (11; 12) of the robotic device (1) is connected to a first holding part (60) by way of a first, flexible connecting part (51.sub.1) of a hinge joint (5.sub.1) Moreover, the movable robotic part (11; 12) is connected to a second holding part (61) by way of a second, flexible connecting part (52.sub.1) of the hinge joint (5.sub.1). This connection is produced in such a way that, when the first holding part (60) moves relative to the second holding part (61) or vice versa, the robotic device (1) pivots the first holding part out of its initial position, and when the part (60 or 61) that has been moved relative to the other part has been brought back, the device restores the part to its initial position.
