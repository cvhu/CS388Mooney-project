An automated data storage library is disclosed for quickly switching to a second accessor when a first accessor fails. Either the first or the second accessor may be designated an active accessor and the other a standby accessor. The library includes first and second library managers, one designated an active library manager and the other a standby library manager, each of the library managers interconnected with one of the accessors for operating the interconnected accessor, and each interconnected with the other of the accessors for operating the interconnected other accessor. The active library manager may operate the first accessor as an active accessor and, upon the first accessor becoming unavailable, immediately switches to operate the second accessor as the active accessor and allows maintenance and servicing of the first accessor simultaneously with operation of the second accessor.
Claims We claim: 1. An automated data storage library for storing and accessing a plurality of data storage media stored in a plurality of storage slots, said library having at least one data storage drive for receiving said data storage media and reading and/or writing data thereon, comprising: first and second accessors for accessing and transporting said data storage media between said storage slots and said data storage drive, said first accessor designated an active accessor and said second a standby accessor; and first and second library managers, said first library manager designated an active library manager and said second a standby library manager, said first and said second library managers respectively associated with said first accessor and said second accessor, for operating said respectively associated accessor, and said first and said second library managers respectively interconnected with said second and said first accessor, for operating said respectively interconnected accessor, said active first library manager operating said first accessor as an active accessor and, upon said first accessor becoming unavailable, immediately operating said second accessor as an active accessor, and allowing performance of maintenance and servicing of said first accessor simultaneously with continued operation of said second accessor. 2. The automated data storage library of claim 1, wherein each of said library managers has a system file with information regarding said accessors, including the operational status of components of said accessors, said library managers are interconnected, and said active library manager communicates to said standby library manager information of the operational status of components of said first accessor as the result of said maintenance and service of said first accessor allowing said standby library manager to update its system file with said information. 3. The automated data storage library of claim 1, additionally comprising an operator input station allowing an operator to communicate with said library managers for entering maintenance and service commands, and wherein said active library manager responds to said commands from said operator input station to command said first accessor to execute said commands. 4. An automated data storage library for storing and accessing a plurality of data storage media stored in a plurality of storage slots, comprising: at least one data storage drive for receiving said data storage media and reading and/or writing data thereon; at least one service bay for storing one of said accessors; first and second accessors for accessing and transporting said data storage media between said storage slots and said data storage drive, said first accessor designated an active accessor and said second a standby accessor; and first and second library managers, said first library manager designated an active library manager and said second a standby library manager, said first and said second library managers respectively associated with said first accessor and said second accessor, for operating said respectively associated accessor, and said first and said second library managers respectively interconnected with said second and said first accessor, for operating said respectively interconnected accessor, said active first library manager operating said first accessor as an active accessor and, upon said first accessor becoming unavailable, immediately operating said second accessor as an active accessor, and allowing performance of maintenance and servicing of said first accessor in said service bay simultaneously with continued operation of said second accessor. 5. The automated data storage library of claim 4, wherein said active library manager commands said first accessor to move to said service bay before performing said maintenance and servicing. 6. The automated data storage library of claim 4, wherein each of said library managers has a system file with information regarding said accessors, including the operational status of components of said accessors, said library managers are interconnected, and said active library manager communicates to said standby library manager information of the operational status of components of said first accessor as the result of said maintenance and service of said first accessor allowing said standby library manager to update its system file with said information. 7. The automated data storage library of claim 4, additionally comprising an operator input station allowing an operator to communicate with said library managers for entering maintenance and service commands, and wherein said active library manager responds to said commands from said operator input station to command said first accessor to execute said commands. 8. A method for maintaining and servicing first and second accessors of an automated data storage library, said first accessor designated an active accessor and said second a standby accessor, said automated data storage library having a plurality of storage slots for storing a plurality of data storage media, having at least one data storage drive for receiving data storage media and reading and/or writing data thereon, and having first and second library managers, said first library manager designated an active library manager and said second a standby library manager, said first and said second library managers respectively associated with said first accessor and said second accessor, for operating said respectively associated accessor, and said first and said second library managers respectively interconnected with said second and said first accessor, for operating said respectively interconnected accessor, said active first library manager operating said first accessor as an active accessor accessing and transporting said data storage media between said storage slots and said data storage drive, said method comprising the steps of: (A) upon said first accessor becoming unavailable, said active library manager operating said second accessor as an active accessor, and (B) said active library manager allowing performance of maintenance of and servicing said first accessor simultaneously with said operation of said second accessor. 9. The method of claim 8, wherein each of said library managers has a system file with information regarding said accessors, including the operational status of components of said accessors, said library managers are interconnected, and wherein said method additionally comprises the steps of said active library manager communicating to said standby library manager information of the operational status of components of said first accessor as the result of said maintenance and service of said first accessor, and said standby library manager updating its system file with said information. 10. The method of claim 8, wherein said library additionally comprises an operator input station allowing an operator to communicate with said library managers for entering maintenance and service commands, and wherein said method additionally comprises said active library manager responding to said commands from said operator input station by commanding said first accessor to execute said commands. 11. The method of claim 8, wherein said library additionally comprises a service bay and wherein said method comprises the additional step of (B1) moving said first accessor to said service bay.
