A wafer sorting system utilizing optical character recognition and optical "gate sensors" to determine the orientation of the wafers for prealigning. It is envisioned that the machine will be installed in conjunction with a computer controller and multiple cassette stations. A first end of a transfer arm of a robot is equipped with an end effector to transfer individual wafers. The end effector of the transfer arm is extendable and retractable to select and remove the desired wafer from its cassette, and to transfer it to the prealigner or a target cassette in its proper orientation. The end effector includes a vacuum pickup and a sensor that enables detection of presence or absence of wafers in the cassette, and any misaligned wafers in the cassette. Further gate sensors are mounted on the prealigner to accomplish the orientation function prior to the wafer being placed on the prealigner chuck. Multiple perimeter points are used to determine the position of the center of the wafer. The optical character recognition capability of the system then allows the individual wafers to be identified and to be sorted as desired.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A wafer sorting machine comprising: at least one cassette station to receive a cassette containing wafers, a robot to remove selected individual wafers from said cassette, a controlling computer, and a prealigner, wherein; said prealigner includes a plurality of gate sensors positioned so that said robot passes each said individual wafer through said gate sensors, each of said gate sensors provides data points indicating a position of a leading edge of said individual wafer and a position of a trailing edge of said individual wafer, said computer processes said data points to determine a center point of said individual wafer and moves said robot to place said individual wafer so that said individual wafer is properly centered, said robot includes an end effector to pick up said individual wafers, said end effector includes a sensing means to determine the presence of said individual wafers, said sensing means includes a collimator in a first fork of said end effector to transmit a light beam that is collected by a receiver in a second fork of said end effector, a rectangular aperture in said second fork extends away from said receiver toward said collimator to shield said receiver from reflected light such that said collector receives only light traveling in a direct linear path from said collimator. 2. A wafer sorting machine comprising: at least one cassette station to receive a cassette containing wafers, a robot to remove selected individual wafers from said cassette, a controlling computer, and a prealigner, wherein; said prealigner includes a plurality of gate sensors positioned so that said robot passes each said individual wafer through said gate sensors, each of said gate sensors provides data points indicating a position of a leading edge of said individual wafer and a position of a trailing edge of said individual wafer, said computer processes said data points to determine a center point of said individual wafer and moves said robot to place said individual wafer so that said individual wafer is properly centered, said computer determines a center point of said individual wafer by grouping said data points into non-adjacent pairs, selecting in sequence each non-adjacent pair of data points, calculating a candidate center point based on each said non-adjacent pair, scoring said candidate center point by comparing a radius of said wafer to distances from said candidate center point to all non-adjacent pairs of data points that were not chosen for calculating said candidate center point, rejecting candidate center points that do not score well, and averaging remaining candidate center positions.
