A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 10, wherein each said receiving section portion includes a respective contact surface portion and a respective bottom section surface portion. 12. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 11, wherein each said bottom section surface portion has therein a drainage opening. 13. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 3, further including a guide portion positioned outwardly of said receiving section, said guide portion having a tapered surface positioned at a level above said contact surface. 14. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 3, including a handle having an upper surface having extending therefrom a protrusion. 15. A workpiece holding section to be employed as a part of a robotic transport apparatus for transporting a workpiece, said workpiece holding section including a receiving section of recessed configuration for receiving a workpiece, said receiving section comprising: a contact surface for contacting a lower peripheral surface of the workpiece; and a bottom section surface positioned inwardly of said contact surface and located at a level below said contact surface, said bottom section surface having formed therein a drainage opening. 16. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 15, wherein said bottom section surface is inclined downwardly toward said opening. 17. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 15, wherein said contact surface includes two spaced contact surface portions on opposite sides of said opening. 18. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 15, wherein said bottom section surface includes a central high region and surface portions on opposite sides of said central high region that incline downwardly in opposite directions therefrom. 19. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 15, divided into two spaced receiving section portions by a longitudinal cut-out. 20. A workpiece receiving section as claimed in claim 19, wherein each said receiving section portion includes a respective contact surface portion and a respective bottom section surface portion. 21. A workpiece receiving section as claimed in claim 20, wherein each said bottom section surface portion has therein a respective said drainage opening. 22. A workpiece receiving section as claimed in claim 15, further including a guide portion positioned outwardly of said receiving section, said guide portion having a tapered surface positioned at a level above said contact surface. 23. A workpiece holding section as claimed in claim 15, including a handle having an upper surface having extending therefrom a protrusion. 24. A polishing apparatus comprising: a polishing table; a workpiece holder for holding and pressing a workpiece against a polishing surface of said polishing table while supplying an abrasive liquid; a workpiece storage unit for storing workpieces to be polished; and a transport mechanism for transporting the workpieces between said workpiece storage unit and said workpiece holder, said transport mechanism comprising a robotic transport apparatus including a robot body and a workpiece holding section connected to said robot body, said workpiece holding section including a receiving section of recessed configuration for receiving a workpiece, said receiving section comprising: a contact surface to contact a lower peripheral surface of the workpiece; and a bottom section surface positioned inwardly of said contact surface and located at a level at least 3 mm below said contact surface. 25. A polishing apparatus comprising: a polishing table; a workpiece holder for holding and pressing a workpiece against a polishing surface of said polishing table while supplying an abrasive liquid; a workpiece storage unit for storing workpieces to be polished; and a transport mechanism for transporting the workpieces between said workpiece storage unit and said workpiece holder, said transport mechanism comprising a robotic transport apparatus including a robot body and a workpiece holding section connected to said robot body, said workpiece holding section including a receiving section of recessed configuration for receiving a workpiece, said receiving section comprising; a contact surface to contact a lower peripheral surface of the workpiece; and a bottom section surface positioned inwardly of said contact surface and located at a level below said contact surface, said bottom section surface having formed therein a drainage opening.
