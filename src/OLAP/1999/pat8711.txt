Methods used in semiconductor electroplating systems, such as for plating copper, onto a semiconductor wafer or other semiconductor workpiece. The methods apply to patterned metal layers plated onto a seed layer which is partially protected by an overlying photoresist or other coating. The methods employ an electrode assembly which has a boot which seals about a contact face of the electrode. The sealing is performed by engaging the seal against photoresist to prevent corrosion of the seal layer. The area enclosed by the sealing includes a via which is surrounded by the seal. The electrode contact extends through the via to provide electrical contact with the metallic seed layer. Plating of copper or other metal proceeds at exposed seed layer areas.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for plating a metal onto the surface of a semiconductor workpiece, the semiconductor workpiece having a processed surface; the processed surface being patterned to include coated surface portions and seed layer portions; said coated surface portions being coated with a photoresist or other nonconductive coating which overlies portions of said seed layer; said seed layer portions including exposed seed layer areas wherein portions of the seed layer are exposed for processing, comprising: selecting an electrode assembly having an electrode contact which is surrounded by an electrode boot; engaging a coated surface portion on the processed surface using the electrode boot, said electrode boot bearing against the coated surface portions to form a seal thereagainst which inhibits entry of plating liquid into a sealed space which is enclosed within said seal by said electrode boot and the processed surface of the semiconductor workpiece; enclosing a via within said seal, said via being present on the processed surface and having exposed seed layer portions therein for making electrical contact to the seed layer; contacting said seed layer through said via with said electrode contact to form an electrically conductive connection between the electrode assembly and said seed layer, said contacting being performed by said electrode contact using a contact face which bears upon the seed layer and is enclosed within said sealed space; wetting the processed surface of the semiconductor workpiece with the plating liquid; passing electrical current through the electrode and plating liquid to cause electroplating to occur upon exposed seed layer areas of the processed surface of the semiconductor workpiece; excluding plating liquid from the sealed space to substantially reduce any plating action about the contact. 2.
