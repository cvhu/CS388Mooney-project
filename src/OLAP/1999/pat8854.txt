A method and a system for causing a neural circuit model to learn typical past control results of a process and using the neural circuit model for supporting an operation of the process. The neural circuit model is caused to learn by using, as input signals, a typical pattern of values of input variables at different points in time and, as a teacher signal, its corresponding values of the control variable. An unlearned pattern of input variables is inputted to the thus-learned neuron circuit model, whereby a corresponding value of the control variable is determined. Preferably, plural patterns at given time intervals can be simultaneously used as patterns to be learned.
