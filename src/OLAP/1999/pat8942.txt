An apparatus and a method for removing and transporting articles from molds. More specifically, the present invention pertains to such an apparatus and method which is particularly well suited for removing the articles from a molding machine having molds in which they are molded, and thereafter carrying the articles within a very short period of time away from the molds and depositing the articles for further processing in a high speed, automated production system. The apparatus removes and transports articles, such as ophthalmic contact lens mold sections or contact lens packaging elements, from a molding station whereby an operating assembly removes the articles from the molding station and transports these in a composite motional displacement enabling rapid conveyance thereof to a first location; a pivotable robotic parts handling element being adapted to receive the articles from the first location and transport these to a further or second location for deposition onto pallets or the like and the continued transport thereof to a treatment or processing facility for producing and/or packaging of the contact lenses.
