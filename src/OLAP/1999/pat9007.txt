The present invention relates, in general, to a process of enzymatically synthesizing nucleic acids containing boranophosphonate linkages that are resistant to degradation. The invention further relates to methods of utilizing such nucleic acids in DNA and RNA amplification and sequencing, gene therapy and molecular detection protocols.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of synthesizing an oligonucleotide comprising an internucleotide boranophosphate linkage comprising: i) synthesizing an oligonucleotide comprising an internucleotide H-phosphonate diester linkage, ii) reacting said oligonucleotide resulting from step (i) with an agent that converts said H-phosphonate diester linkage to a phosphite triester linkage, under conditions such that said conversion is effected, iii) boronating said phosphite triester linkage resulting from step (ii) so that a boranophosphate triester linkage is formed; and iv) subjecting said boranophosphate triester linkage resulting from step (iii) to conditions such that said boranophosphate triester linkage is converted to a boranophosphate diester linkage so that said oligonucleotide comprising an internucleotide boranophosphate linkage is formed. 2. The method according to claim 1 wherein said agent of step (ii) is a silylating or halogenating agent. 3. The method according to claim 1 wherein said conversion step (ii) is effected with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. 4. The method according to claim 1 wherein said step (ii) is effected under anhydrous and anoxic conditions. 5. The method according to claim 1 wherein said boronation of step (iii) is effected using an amine borane. 6. The method according to claim 1 wherein said boronation of step (iii) is effected using a pyridine borane complex. 7. The method according to claim 1 wherein said step (iv) is effected using alkaline conditions. 8. The method accordance to claim 1 wherein step (iv) is effected using ammonia.
