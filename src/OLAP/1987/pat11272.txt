A remotely operated hand gear train for the orientation of an end effector has an external housing mounted onto a robot arm and defines a first axis A.sub.1. A first housing is rotatably mounted within the external housing for movement about the first axis A.sub.1 and defines therein a second axis A.sub.2 which is substantially perpendicular to the first axis A.sub.1. A second housing is rotatably mounted in the first housing for rotation about the second axis A.sub.2 and defines therein an axis A.sub.3 which is normal to axis A.sub.2 and radially spaced from axis A.sub.1. A third housing is rotatably mounted in the second housing for rotation about axis A.sub.3 and has a gear rack circumferentially disposed about the end thereof.
