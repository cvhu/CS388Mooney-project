The present invention provides a technique as well as a system whereby through the use of industrial automation, windshields and the like can be inserted into a vehicle which is on a continuously moving conveyor line without stopping the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle is in motion on the conveyor during the insertion. The windshield can be automatically centered for robot acquisition through a unique mechanical device; and, multi-sensor information is converted into real-time path modification signals for robot guidance.
