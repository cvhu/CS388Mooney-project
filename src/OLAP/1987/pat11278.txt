A low-divergence 1.06 micrometer wavelength beam from a total-internal-reflection, face-pumped laser (TIR-FPL) is focused onto the end of a quartz optical fiber to a spot having a size smaller than the fiber diameter and with a beam cone angle less than twice the numerical aperture of the fiber. The fiber transmits the energy to emerge at the other end where it is collimated and focused onto material to be processed. A laser average output power level greater than 400 watts can be transmitted through an optical fiber having a diameter less than 600 micrometers.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An improved high power laser energy delivery system comprising: a solid-state total-internal-reflection face-pumped laser for producing a near infrared or visible wavelength laser beam which has an average power output level greater than 400 watts and a beam divergence less than one milliradian; a single fiber optic serving as a light guide and having a diameter less than 600 micrometers and a given numerical aperture; at least one focusing lens having a given focal length and which focuses said laser beam on one end of said fiber optic to a spot having a size smaller than the fiber diameter, where spot size is proportional to the product of lens focal length and laser beam divergence, and with a beam cone angle less than twice said numerical aperture so that laser energy entering said fiber is transmitted by total internal reflection to emerge at the other end; and an optical system coupled to the other end of said fiber to focus the emerging laser beam onto material to be processed. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein said fiber diameter is less than 300 micrometers. 3. The system of claim 1 wherein said laser is comprised of a laser slab of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet.
