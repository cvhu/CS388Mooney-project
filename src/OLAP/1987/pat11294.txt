The invention combines a plurality of ultrasonic ranging transducers (11) arrayed proximate the end (12) of a movable robot arm (13), all transducers (11) being mounted to a common base so as to be pivotally movable both horizontally and vertically relative to the robot arm (13) by stepping motors (17 and 20). By controlling the pivotal movements of the transducer array (10) by a microcomputer (22) so as to look in the direction of intended travel of the robot arm end (13), and as to the robot arm end (13) moves, unexpected objects in the path of the robot (14) or aberrant motion by the robot (14) become easily detected. Upon the sensing of an obstruction to the direction of motion of the robot arm (13), or aberrant motion thereof, a signal from the microcomputer (22) to the robot (14) controls will halt further operation until the obstruction is removed or the problem corrected.
Claims We claim: 1. An ultrasonic ranging control system for a robot having a movable arm, said system comprising: (a) an ultrasonic transducer array for transmitting an acoustical pulse and for detecting a reflected echo, said transducer array being mounted proximate to the distal end of the movable arm so as to be arcuately pivotable in both a horizontal and vertical direction, said ultrasonic transducer array including a plurality of ultrasonic transducers arrayed in an angularly manner so as to emulate a single transducer with a wide transmit and receive pattern in substantially the horizontal plane, and each transducer having an individual beam width of approximately 10 degrees to each side, said individual transducers being arranged arcuately about a horizontal plane approximately 20 degrees apart, whereby with a quantity of five such transducers, a horizontal beam width of approximately 100 degrees is attained; (b) circuit means for measuring the elapsed time between initial transmission and echo detection by said transducer array and for providing an output signal indicative of said elapsed time and for conversion of said elapsed time to a signal representative of distance; (c) azimuth bi-directional stepping motor for positioning said transducer array horizontally about a vertical axis relative to the distal end of the movable arm independent of and prior to the movement of the arm; (d) an elevation bi-directional stepping motor for reciprocating said transducer array in an up and down vertical sweep about a horizontal axis relative to the distal end of the movable arm independent of and prior to movement of the arm; (e) a controller for activating and monitoring said ultrasonic transducer array to provide a command signal when said transducer array senses an unprogrammed obstruction within a predetermined threshold distance in the intended direction of travel of the robot arm and for effecting the control of said azimuth and elevation stepping motors whereby a continual up and down vertical sweep of said transducer array is performed as said transducer array is positioned in the horizontal plane so as to look in the intended direction of travel of the movable arm; (f) a hold circuit means for receiving said command signal from said controller and for providing a continuous hold signal to the robot arm as long as said transducer array senses the continuing presence of said unprogrammed obstruction within said predetermined threshold distance in the intended direction of travel of the robot arm; and (g) an end effector means positioned proximate the distal end of the movable arm for performing a predetermined robot work function, said end effector means being separate from and operating independent of said ultrasonic transducer array. 2. A systemm according to claim 1, further comprising means for controlling aberrant motion of said robot arm while said system is in the hold mode. 3. An ultrasonic ranging control safety system according to claim 1, wherein the extent of horizontal pivot of said transducer array about a vertical axis relative to the proximal end of the robot arm is about 135.degree. in each direction from the horizontal centerline defined by the robot arm. 4. An ultrasonic ranging control safety system according to claim 3, wherein the extent of vertical sweep of said transducer array about a horizontal axis relative to the proximal end of the robot arm is about 75.degree. in each direction from the position of the transducer array facing in a direction substantially parallel to the upper surface of the robot arm. 5. An ultrasonic ranging control safety system according to claim 4, wherein an audio alarm is sounded when an unprogrammed obstruction is sensed within a predetermined threshold distance of the robot arm. 6. An ultrasonic ranging control system for a robot having a movable arm, said system comprising: (a) an ultrasonic transducer array for transmitting an acoustical pulse and for detecting a reflected echo, said transducer array being mounted on said robot so as to be arcuately pivotable in both a horizontal and vertical direction independently of robot motion, said ultrasonic transducer array including a plurality of ultrasonic transducers arrayed in an angular manner so as to emulate a single transducer with a wide transmit and receive pattern in substantially the horizontal plane, and each transducer having an individual beam width of approximately 10 degrees to each side, said individual transducers being arranged arcuately about a horizontal plane approximately 20 degrees apart, whereby with a quantity of five such transducers, a horizontal beam width of approximately 100 degrees is attained; (b) means for arcuately moving said transducer array in a horizontal plane about a vertical axis prior to movement of the arm; (c) means for arcuately moving said transducer array in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis contemporaneously with said arcuate motion in a horizontal plane bout a vertical axis prior to movement of the arm; (d) means for measuring the elapsed time between initial transmission and echo detection by said transducer array and for providing an output signal indicative of said elapsed time for conversion of said elapsed time to a distance function; (e) controller means for activating and monitoring said ultrasonic transducer array to provide a command signal when said transducer array senses an unprogrammed obstruction within a predetermined threshold distance of said robot along an intended path of travel; (f) a hold circuit means for receiving said command signal from said controller means and for providing a continuous hold signal to the robot arm as long as said transducer array senses the continuing presence of said unprogrammed obstruction; and (g) an end effector means positioned proximate the distal end of the movable arm for performing a predetermined robot work function; said end effector means being separate from and operating independent of said ultrasonic transducer array.
