The invention is a robotic parts presentation system for delivering a workpiece into a work envelope of an industrial manipulator. This system also centers the delivered workpiece about the centerline of the workpiece in the X and Y axes directions thereof. The invention provides an accurate system for the location of the part with respect to a programmed pickup point for acquisition by an industrial manipulator. The system comprises in combination a centering device which is disposed within the work envelope of the industrial manipulator and a flip-over mechanism for delivering the workpiece from a transfer station outside of the work envelope onto the centering device.
Claims I claim: 1. An automated part centering system for centering a workpiece in a predetermined orientation relative to a fixed point for acquisition by a robot or the like, said system comprising: a base means having a substantially planar top portion which defines thereon said fixed point; anti-friction roller means extending upwardly from the top portion and adapted to supportably receive thereon the workpiece, such that the workpiece is movable relative thereto; a first pair of X-axes arms slidably mounted on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a second pair of X-axes arms slidably mounted in an opposed relationship relative to said first pair of X-axes arms on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away form said fixed point; a first multiple face cam means in mechanical communication with said first and second pair of X-axes arms for effecting the reciprocal movement thereof; a first pair of Y-axes arms slidably mounted on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a second pair of Y-axes arms slidably mounted in an opposed relationship relative to said first pair of Y-axes arms on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a second multiple face cam means in mechanical communication with said first and second pairs of Y-axes arms for effecting the reciprocal movement thereof; and drive means disposed in said base member and in mechanical communication with said first and second multiple face cam means by means of separate adjustable friction clutch means to permit controlled slippage between said drive means and the cam means, said drive means being reversible in order to effect the aforesaid reciprocal movement, wherein a workpiece resting on said anti-friction roller means is centered with respect to said fixed point through the engagement thereof by said first and second pairs of X and Y-axes arms during the movement thereof toward said fixed point. 2. The automated part centering system according to claim 1 wherein the first and second opposed pairs of X and Y axes arms include extending finger like members having a rotatable sleeve thereon which engages the workpiece. 3. A robotic parts presentation system for delivering a workpiece into a work envelope of an industrial manipulator and for centering the delivered workpiece about its centerline in the X and Y-axes direction, providing an accurate location with respect to a predetermined pickup point for acquisition by said industrial manipulator, said system comprising in combination: I. a centering device disposed within the work envelope of said industrial manipulator, said centering device comprising: a base means having a substantially planar top portion which defines thereon said fixed point; anti-friction roller means extending upwardly from the top portion and adapted to supportably receive thereon the workpiece, such that the workpiece is movable relative thereto; a first pair of X-axes arms slidably mounted on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a second pair of X-axes arms slidably mounted in an opposed relationship relative to said first pair of X-axes arms on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a first multiple face cam means in mechanical communication with said first and second pair of X-axes arms for effecting the reciprocal movement thereof; a first pair of Y-axes arms slidably mounted on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a second pair of Y-axes arms slidably mounted in an opposed relationship relative to said first pair of Y-axes arms on the top portion for reciprocal movement toward and away from said fixed point; a second multiple face cam means in mechanical communication with said first and second pairs of Y-axes arms for effecting the reciprocal movement thereof; and first drive means disposed in said base member and in mechanical communication with said first and second multiple face cam means by means of separate adjustable friction clutch means to permit controlled slippage between said first drive means and the cam means, said drive means being reversible in order to effect the aforesaid first reciprocal movement; II. a flip-over mechanism for the delivery of the workpiece from a transfer station outside of the work envelope onto said anti-friction roller means of said centering device, comprising: a second drive means disposed between the transfer station and said centering device; a flip-over arm rotatably mounted on said second drive means for reciprocal rotational movement between the transfer station and said centering device, and including a cantilevered arm portion; and an end effector means disposed on said cantilevered arm portion and adapted to releasably engage the workpiece to be delivered; wherein the workpiece delivered by the flip-over mechanism and resting on said anti-friction roller means is centered with respect to said fixed point through the engagement thereof by said first and second pair of X and Y-axes arms during the movement thereof toward said fixed point.
