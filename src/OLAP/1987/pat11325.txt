An apparatus and method is disclosed for providing tactile feedback information to the operator of a remotely operated manipulator assembly, such as a robot arm, by mechanically coupling a vibration sensitive transducer to said assembly and audibly reproducing the transducer output for operator listening. The use of an accelerometer as a vibration sensitive transducer is disclosed as well as techniques for cancelling environmental noise.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a combination, a manipulator arm assembly and a tactile feedback apparatus comprising: (a) a remotely operated manipulator arm having movable portion, a gripping mechanism carried by said movable portion, and a fluid drive assembly coupled to displace said movable portion and said gripping mechanism, said fluid drive assembly being formed for displacement of said movable portion and said gripping mechanism without producing substantial acoustically induced vibration in said arm; and (b) a tactile feedback apparatus including: (i) an accelerometer formed to provide an electrical output signal and rigidly mechanically coupled to one of said movable portion and said gripping mechanism sufficiently proximate to said gripping mechanism to enable sensing of contact-induced vibrations occurring in said gripping mechanism upon contact of said gripping mechanism with an object and distinguishing of said contact-induced vibrations from background acoustical noise from said fluid drive assembly and from the medium surrounding said manipulator arm; and (ii) means coupled to said accelerometer for audibly reproducing said output signal for operator listening. 2. The manipulator arm assembly and tactile feedback apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein, said accelerometer is rigidly coupled directly to said gripping mechanism. 3. The manipulator arm assembly and tactile feedback apparatus as defined in claim 2 wherein, said manipulator arm includes a stationary portion and said movably portion is mounted for movement with respect to said stationary portion, and said fluid drive assembly includes at least one master piston-cylinder assembly positioned on said stationary portion and at least one slave piston-cylinder assembly coupled for fluid communication with respect to said master piston-cylinder assembly, said slave piston-cylinder assembly being mounted on said movable portion to drive said movable portion and said gripping mechanism.
