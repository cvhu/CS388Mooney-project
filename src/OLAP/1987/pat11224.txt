An arrangement for controlling the flow of fluid in which the fluid is allowed to flow through a selected number of parallel paths of various flow capacities as determined by restricting orifices and cutoff valves. Accurate volume/length of fluid is dispensed at variable velocities by controlling both applicator velocity and flow rate. An arrangement is also provided for controlling the shape of the deposited fluid employing controlled air flow confinement.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An arrangement for enabling air-assisted fluid material deposition shape control, comprising: a source of fluid for deposition supplied at predetermined pressure; an inlet manifold for dividing incoming fluid into at least two paths; a restricting orifice in each said path for setting a predetermined flow rate in said path; a controllable valve in each said path for transmitting flow or blocking flow of said fluid; an outlet manifold for combining said fluid from each said path into an output conduit; applicating means having a central orifice for material deposition and at least one air stream orifice located lateral to said central orifice with respect to intended direction of travel during material deposition; said applicating means forming a fluid bead profile of predetermined size and shape; a source of air supplied at predetermined pressure; an inlet manifold for dividing incoming air into at least two air paths; an air restricting orifice in each said air path for setting a predetermined flow rate in said air path; a controllable valve in each said air path for transmitting flow or blocking flow of said air; and outlet manifold for combining said air from each said path into an output conduit; and a system controller for controlling the flow rate of said fluid and the flow rate of said air to said applicating means, directed flow of said air controlling shape and size of said fluid bead profile emitted from said applicating means, said air being emitted from said air restricting orifices in substantially concentrated streams to prevent said fluid bead from spreading more than a predetermined amount.
