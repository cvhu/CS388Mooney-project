A manipulator device particularly adapted for deep-sea, submersible use utilizes a human-like arm and a novel shoulder arrangement mounted on a base through a base pivot. The manipulator is hydraulically powered and a hydraulic manifold forms a body of the shoulder arrangement and is situated adjacent an azimuth control actuator, an elbow control actuator and an upper arm control actuator all mounted to the body and rotatable with the body about the base pivot. The arm includes an upper arm swingably connected to the shoulder via the upper arm control actuator and a forearm swingably connected to the upper arm at an elbow joint and controlled by the elbow control actuator. A wrist assembly and appropriate actuators are mounted to a distal end of the forearm and a gripper assembly and associated actuators are connected to a distal end of the wrist assembly.
