A gripping apparatus which includes a housing in which is slidably mounted a longitudinally movable gripper operator. A pair of gripper arms are rollably mounted on the gripper operator. Each gripper arm carries a gripper jaw engageable with a workpiece. The gripper jaws are moved along straight line travel paths into gripping engagement with a workpiece when the gripper operator is moved in one longitudinal direction, and they are disengaged correspondingly from the workpiece when the gripper operator is moved in the other longitudinal direction.

A gripping apparatus as defined in claim 8, characterized in that, said means for moving said gripper operator comprises, a cylinder guide adaptor operatively connecting said gripper operator body to said power means. 10. A gripping apparatus characterized in that it comprises: (a) a housing having a longitudinal and a transverse axis; (b) a gripper operator having a longitudinal and a transverse axis, and further having a front side surface and a rear side surface, slidably mounted in said housing for longitudinal movement therein; (c) a pair of gripper arms rollably mounted in a criss-cross manner on said gripper operator, with one gripper arm on one of said side surfaces of the gripper operator and the other gripper arm on the other of said side surfaces of the gripper operator; (d) said gripper arms each carrying a gripper jaw for gripping engagement with a workpiece; (e) cam means for restraining each of said gripper arms against movement relative to the gripper operator axially of the longitudinal axis of the gripper operator but which permits crosswise movement of the gripper arms relative to the longitudinal axis of said gripper operator, and toward and away from a workpiece, to move the gripper jaws carried by the gripper arms in straight line travel paths; (f) means for moving said gripper operator longitudinally in said housing, whereby when said gripper operator is moved in one longitudinal direction, the gripper jaws on the gripper arms are moved along straight line travel paths into gripping engagement with a workpiece, and when the gripper operator is moved in the other longitudinal direction, the gripper jaws are retracted from the workpiece along the same straight line travel paths; (g) said housing comprising a front cover plate and a rear cover plate, and each of said cover plates includes integral side, top and bottom plates; (h) said gripper arms are each rollably disposed at an acute angle relative to the longitudinal axes of the housing and gripper operator; (i) power means for moving said gripper operator; (j) a first crosswise cam slot formed in one of said cover plates and a cam roller rollably mounted in said first crosswise cam slot and being attached to a first one of said gripper arms; (k) a second crosswise cam slot formed in the other of said cover plates, and a cam roller rollably mounted in said second crosswise cam slot and being attached to a second one of said gripper arms; (l) gripper jaws detachably mounted on said gripper arms; (m) said gripper operator comprises, a gripper operator body on which are formed said front and rear side surfaces, roller support means operatively mounted on each of said side surfaces of said gripper operator body for rollably supporting one of said gripper arms on each of said side surfaces; (n) said means for moving said gripper operator comprises, a cylinder guide adaptor operatively connecting said gripper operator body to said power means; and, (o) said cylinder guide adaptor comprises, (1) a base plate connected to the power means; (2) a pair of spaced apart, longitudinal arms having one of their ends integrally connected to the base plate, and the other of their ends pivotally attached to the gripper operator body by a transverse shaft; and, (3) a roller carried on the transverse shaft on each side of the gripper operator body for rolling support of the gripper arms on said each side of the gripper operator body.
