A mobile transport unit for independently operating within an enclosed environment. The transport unit is adapted for carrying a robotic manipulator arm and cargo within the environment, and includes an infrared communications transmitter/receiver for communicating with an extra-vehicular central processing unit. The transport unit includes electric motors for driving and for steering the unit. A laser docking module precisely determines the vehicle's location relative to a fixed point within the environment. Ultrasonic sensors placed about the vehicle can detect objects within a preselected range for collision avoidance and safety purposes. The vehicle is controlled by a central computer which receives inputs from the infrared communications system and from on-board sensors including directional sensors, distance measuring sensors, a gyroscope, the ultrasonic sensors, and the docking module. The on-board computer directs the vehicle and the robotic arm based on information received from these inputs, and allows for the continuous operation of the vehicle without recalibration. Power is supplied to the vehicle by an on-board battery pack, and the vehicle is enclosed by a protective skin for reasons of cleanliness and safety, and to prevent turbulent airflow around the wafer cassettes and the robotic arm.
