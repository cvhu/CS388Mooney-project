A rotary clamp having a common plane mounting arrangement that provides a first planar surface for mounting the rotary clamp to a support member and a second planar surface for mounting a workpiece engaging means to the rotary clamp wherein the first and second planar surfaces lie in a common plane for simplifying the set up procedure of the rotary clamp. The first planar surface is formed on a housing of the rotary clamp, and the second planar surface is formed on a pivot pin of the rotary clamp. The first and second planar surfaces are spaced from one another to provide proper relief so that the workpiece engaging means may freely rotate without interference from the second planar surface. The pivot pin provides a large end portion seated within a recess of the housing that remains externally accessible with respect to the housing. A bearing means is provided for rotatably supporting the pivot pin end portion within the recess and for longitudinally supporting the pivot pin end portion against thrust forces along the longitudinal axis of the recess. The enlarged pivot pin end portion and bearing means provide added stability and durability. By being externally accessible with respect to the housing, the bearing means may be inspected and/or replaced without the need for disassembling the rotary clamp.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A rotary clamp supported by a supporting member and having a common plane mounting arrangement comprising: a housing having a first planar surface for mounting said supporting member thereto; a pivot pin having a second planar surface separate from said first planar surface and lying in the same plane as said first planar surface; means, disposed within said housing, for providing rotary motion to said pivot pin wherein said rotary motion providing means comprises: means for providing linear motion; and means for converting linear motion from said linear motion providing means into rotary motion of said pivot pin; means for engaging a work piece wherein said work piece engaging means is mounted to said second planar surface of said pivot pin for simplifying the set up procedure of said rotary clamp; and cam means, formed on said pivot pin, for engaging and supporting said linear motion providing means. 2. A rotary clamp supported by a supporting member having a common plane mounting arrangement comprising: a housing having a longitudinal axis and an aperture extending through said housing along a transverse axis transverse to and offset from said longitudinal axis and having a cylindrical recess coaxially aligned with said aperture and externally accessible with respect to said housing; a pivot pin exposed within said housing and having a body portion extending through said aperture and into said recess of said housing; means, disposed within said housing, for providing rotational movement to said pivot pin and said rotational movement providing means comprising: means for providing linear motion; and means for converting linear motion from said linear motion providing means into rotary motion of said pivot pin; a bearing disposed along the inside diameter of said recess of said housing; said pivot pin having a larger end portion coupled to said body portion of said pivot pin and disposed concentrically within said bearing and said recess of said housing, and said end portion of said pivot pin having a cylindrical bearing surface for rotational engagement with said bearing, and a flange integral with and extending radially from said end portion of said pivot pin wherein said flange abuts the top surface of the bearing to support said end portion of said pivot pin from thrust forces along said transverse axis, and said larger end portion of said pivot pin remaining externally accessible with respect to said housing; a clamp arm connected to said end portion of said pivot pin; and at least one cam surface integrally formed on said body portion of said pivot pin for engaging and supporting said linear motion providing means against linkage forces applied to said linear motion providing means.
