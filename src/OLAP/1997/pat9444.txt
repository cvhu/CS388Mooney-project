An apparatus and method for controlling a surface-based vehicle provides three operational modes: a manual operation, a tele-operation, and an autonomous operation. In manual operation, an operator directly manipulates vehicle controls on the vehicle. In tele-operation, the operator controls the vehicle from a remote position. In autonomous operation, the vehicle controls itself based on its position and a predetermined path. The apparatus and method of the present invention provides an orderly transition between manual operation, tele-operation, and autonomous operation of the vehicle.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A surface based vehicle control system comprising: (1) means for providing for manual operation of a vehicle, wherein an operator directly manipulates vehicle controls on the vehicle; (2) means for providing for tele-operation of said vehicle, wherein the operator directly controls operation of said vehicle, including speed and steering, from a position remote from said vehicle; (3) means for providing for autonomous operation of said vehicle; and (4) means for providing for an orderly transition between manual operation, tele-operation, and autonomous operation of said vehicle. 2. A surface based vehicle control method comprising the steps of: (1) providing for manual operation of a vehicle, wherein an operator directly manipulates vehicle controls on the vehicle; (2) providing for tele-operation of said vehicle, wherein the operator directly controls operation of said vehicle, including speed and steering, from a position remote from said vehicle; (3) providing for autonomous operation of said vehicle; and (4) providing for an orderly transition between manual operation, tele-operation, and autonomous operation of said vehicle.
