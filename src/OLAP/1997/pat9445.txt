The present invention relates to a charging apparatus for a robot cleaner and a method for charging the robot cleaner by which the robot cleaner can be accurately induced to a power source supplier to receive a battery charge when a battery power source drops below a predetermined level. The apparatus includes a control unit for controlling an overall operation, a memory which stores a driving program including structures for various rooms for which cleaning operations may be performed, and a driving unit for moving the robot cleaner in forward, reverse, left and right directions according to control signals of the control unit. A travel distance detecting unit is provided for detecting a travel distance covered by the driving unit and a travel direction detecting unit is provided for detecting a travel direction varied by the driving unit. An obstacle detecting unit is also provided for detecting whether or not there is an obstacle with a cleaning area and for detecting a distance to the obstacle from the cleaner. A charged level detecting unit detects a charge voltage level of a battery and an electric power source supplier is provided for charging the battery to above a predetermined level when the charge voltage level of the battery detected by the charge level detecting unit drops below the predetermined level. An electric power source receiving unit is also provided for electrically connecting the electric power source supplier to the battery so that the power source supplied from the electric power source supplier can be applied to charge the battery.

A charging apparatus for a robot cleaner as defined in claim 1, wherein the electric power source supplier comprises: a body; a light emitting unit disposed at an external upper side of a vertical portion on the body so that an optical signal can be generated to induce the robot cleaner; a connecting terminal movably mounted within an inner area of the body so that the battery can be electrically connected to a contact surface of the electric power source receiving means of the robot cleaner being induced by the optical signal emitted from the light emitting unit; and a guide member for being formed within the body with a guide groove in order to guide the connecting terminal. 3. The charging apparatus for a robot cleaner as defined in claim 2, wherein the electric power source supplier further comprises: a cover member slidably mounted inside of a horizontal portion of the body so that the connecting terminal which is operationally connected to the guide groove of the guide member can be covered in order not to be seen from outside of the body; a rotatable pinion member for being rotated to slide the cover member; and a link member for connecting the pinion member, cover member and connecting terminal together so that the connecting terminal can be moved up and down by rotation of the pinion member. 4. A charging apparatus for a robot cleaner as defined in claim 1, wherein the electric power source receiving means comprises: a light receiving unit for receiving an optical signal generated from a light emitting unit of the electric power source supplier; a bumper member attached under the light receiving unit in order to cushion a shock of the electric power source receiving means when the robot cleaner hits a side surface of a vertical portion at the electric power source supplier; a contact sensor disposed within the bumper member to detect a condition where the electric power receiving means has contacted the electric power source supplier; and a contact terminal formed at a lower surface of the robot cleaner so that a connecting terminal of the electric power source supplier can contact the battery via a wiring. 5. A method for charging a robot cleaner which is internally stored with information on a current position thereof, an area to be cleaned and a position of an electric power source supplier, the method comprising the step of: storing initial position information of the cleaner against X and Y axes in a control means during an initial contact between the cleaner and the electric power source supplier before beginning a cleaning operation; moving the cleaner in a cleaning operation; detecting a charge on a battery power source for supplying a driving energy to the cleaner in order to determine to what degree the battery power source has been consumed during movement of the cleaner in the cleaning operation; and moving the robot cleaner to the electric power source supplier according to the internally stored information on a current position and the initial position information stored in the initial position information storage step in order to charge the battery power source when the charge on the battery power source detected by the detecting step is below a predetermined level set by a control means. 6. A method for charging a robot cleaner as defined in claim 5, wherein the initial position information storage step is performed by detecting the initial position information of the robot cleaner against X and Y axes in the cleaning area by way of an ultrasonic sensor. 7. A method for charging a robot cleaner as defined in claim 5, wherein the moving step for moving the robot cleaner to the electric power source supplier includes rotating the robot cleaner to the right so that the robot cleaner travels to a wall surface near the electric power source supplier, determining the position of the robotic cleaner, rotating the robot cleaner 90 degrees to the right to allow the robot cleaner to travel along a wall surface to a position separated from the electric power source supplier by a predetermined distance, moving the robot cleaner into position at a low speed, and moving the robot cleaner backward to connect the robot cleaner to the electric power source supplier.
