An improved robotic power grapple having the capability to both manipulate and impact objects. The grapple has a head assembly containing pivotal jaws and an impact hammer disposed within a rotation device to allow the head assembly and jaws to rotate about a central axis. An impact rod extends through the rotation device and through an opening in the tips of the jaws to permit impaction of objects proximate the opening. In combination with an articulated boom and orientation device, the improved grapple may be utilized in severe-duty foundry operations to remove gates and risers from foundry castings.
