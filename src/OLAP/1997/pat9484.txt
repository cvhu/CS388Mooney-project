A method is disclosed for identifying an object. The method includes the steps of (a) providing individual ones of objects within a predetermined class of objects with a gain medium comprised of an electromagnetic radiation emitting and amplifying first phase and an electromagnetic radiation scattering second phase, the gain medium being responsive to electromagnetic radiation having a first wavelength for emitting electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths within a predetermined band of wavelengths; (b) irradiating the objects with the first wavelength; (c) detecting an emission from the irradiated objects, the emission including one or more second wavelengths that are within the predetermined band of wavelengths; and (d) identifying an object as belonging to a predetermined class of objects from the detected emission. Also disclosed is a method for detecting the presence of a structure within an object, which also employs the gain medium and the step of irradiating.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for identifying an object, comprising the steps of: providing individual ones of objects within a predetermined class of objects with a gain medium comprised of an electromagnetic radiation emitting and amplifying first phase and an electromagnetic radiation scattering second phase, the gain medium being responsive to electromagnetic radiation having a first wavelength for emitting electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths within a predetermined band of wavelengths; irradiating the objects with the first wavelength; detecting an emission from the irradiated objects, the emission including one or more second wavelengths that are within the predetermined band of wavelengths; and identifying an object as belonging to a predetermined class of objects from the detected emission. 2. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein there is a set of objects comprising one or more classes of objects, and further comprising a step of segregating an identified object from the set of objects. 3. A method for detecting the presence of a structure within an object, comprising the steps of: providing a surface region of the object with a gain medium comprised of an electromagnetic radiation emitting and amplifying first phase and an electromagnetic radiation scattering second phase, the gain medium being responsive to electromagnetic radiation having a first wavelength for emitting electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths within a band of wavelengths having a second wavelength that differs from the first wavelength; irradiating the gain medium with a first pulse of radiation having the first wavelength; propagating the emitted radiation having the second wavelength into the object; in response to the propagating radiation encountering a change in an index of refraction that is associated with the structure, reflecting a portion of the propagating radiation back toward the surface of the object; in response to the reflected radiation entering the gain medium coincidentally with a second pulse, enhancing the emission of the electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths within the band of wavelengths having the second wavelength; detecting the enhanced emission; and correlating the detected enhanced emission with a time between the occurrence of the first and the second pulses for determining at least a distance from the structure to the surface of the object.
