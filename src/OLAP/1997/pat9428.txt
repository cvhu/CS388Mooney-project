A prime mover for a rotatable member supported for rotation in a single plane on a stationary base is provided wherein reaction torque applied to the base due to powering such rotation is greatly reduced. At least one gyroscopic mass in a gimbal support is mounted to the rotatable member, with an axis of rotation of the gyroscopic mass being generally parallel to the plane of movement of the member. A force is applied, as by a solenoid, to the gimbal in a direction normal to the plane of rotation so as to cause precession of the gyroscopic mass, thereby rotating the rotatable member. Applications of the invention include robotics and machine tools, where the rotatable member may be a swinging arm robot having a tool affixed to an end thereof, or a rotary table to which a workpiece is mounted.
