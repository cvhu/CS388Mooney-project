An electromagnetic fastener for manipulating objects in space uses the matic attraction of various metals. An end effector is attached to a robotic manipulating system having an electromagnet such that when current is supplied to the electromagnet, the object is drawn and affixed to the end effector, and when the current is withheld, the object is released. The object to be manipulated includes a multiplicity of ferromagnetic patches at various locations to provide multiple areas for the effector on the manipulator to become affixed to the object. The ferromagnetic patches are sized relative to the object's geometry and mass.
Claims We claim: 1. An apparatus for manipulating an object in space comprising: a. a magnetically permeable area on the object to be manipulated; b. an end effector attached to a robotic manipulating system having an electromagnet such that when current is supplied to the electromagnet, the object is drawn and affixed to the end effector, and when the current is withheld, the object is released. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the magnetically permeable area includes a ferromagnetic patch sized relative to the object's geometry and mass. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 wherein the object to be manipulated includes a multiplicity of ferromagnetic patches at various locations to provide multiple areas for the effector on the manipulator to become affixed to the object. 4. The apparatus of claim 3 wherein the manipulator includes solar panel covered arms to supply power to the effector. 5. A method for manipulating an object in a space environment comprising: providing a magnetically permeable area on the object to be manipulated; positioning a manipulator having an end effector with a metal complementary to the metallic patch toward the patch, supplying a current to the end effector to cause the object to be drawn and affixed to the manipulator; deactivating the current in the end effector to release the object.
