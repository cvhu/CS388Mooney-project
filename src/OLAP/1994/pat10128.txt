A robotic arm calibration system is described which comprises a video line scan camera vision system used in conjunction with a plurality of novel "N"-shaped targets in an automated tape storage library. The targeting system of the present invention provides, with a single horizontal video scan of the target, all of the data necessary to enable calculation of a reference point of the robotic arm with respect to each target to thereby obtain precise robotic arm calibration in relationship to the library system workspace. The position of the robotic arm is determined using the vision system in conjunction with calibration targets which are located within the tape cartridge library, in addition to a target located on the robotic arm. The present system functions independently of the spacing between the arm retrieval mechanism and the tape cartridge storage cells.
