A unit includes one or more semiconductor chips. Each chip has a front surface with a plurality of contacts surrounded by a passivated surface. The passivated surface is not wettable by bonding material. The contacts have masses of bonding material thereon and the masses have a height less than the diameter of the contacts.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A unit including one or more semiconductor chips, each such chip having a front surface with a plurality of contacts and a passivation layer having openings therein, said passivation layer extending over said contacts so that said contacts are exposed through said openings in said passivation layer and said contacts have exposed areas bounded by said passivation layer, said passivation layer being not wettable by bonding material, said exposed areas of said contacts having masses of bonding material thereon, said masses having height less than the diameter of said exposed areas of said contacts. 2. A unit as claimed in claim 1 wherein said exposed areas of said contacts are less than about 100 .mu.m in diameter. 3. A unit as claimed in claim 1 wherein said bonding material is a solder.
