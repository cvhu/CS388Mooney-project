Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of PTPN12. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding PTPN12. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of PTPN12 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of PTPN12 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 20 to 80 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 1771 through 1790 of a coding region of a nucleic acid molecule encoding human PTPN12 (SEQ ID NO: 4), wherein said compound comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety or nucleobase and specifically hybridizes with said region and inhibits the expression of human PTPN12. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-o-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
