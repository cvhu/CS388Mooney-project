A computerized system and method for inspecting and measuring a ball-shaped wire bond formed by an automated bonder pre-programmed to attach a connecting bond onto a bond pad of an integrated circuit by first obtaining a first image of said bond pad before bond attachment, then determining the coordinates of the center of said pad. Second, the bonder is instructed to attach a ball-shaped wire bond to the center of said pad. Next, a second image of said bond pad is obtained after bond attachment; this second image comprises an image of the ball-shaped portion of the bond and an image of the wire portion of said bond. The coordinates of the center of the ball-shaped portion of the bond are obtained by computer processing of the first and second images. The coordinates of the bond center and the pad center are compared, creating information for quality control of the bonder instruction and the bonding process. Finally, the bond process quality is controlled by inputting new bonder instruction for correcting any identified differences between the center coordinates.
