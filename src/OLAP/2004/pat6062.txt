A robot drive assembly for moving a working tool in x, y, z and theta directions comprising three independent, coaxially nested tubes, each tube being driven around a common central axis by drive belts attached to separate drive motors located in a mounting flange associated with the outermost tube. The motors, and the tubes which they drive, provide horizontal rotary motion to a robot arm attached to the upper end of the outer tube and the wrist and elbow of that arm. A fourth motor controls vertical motion of the whole assembly. The robot system also includes motor position adjustment structure and belt tension structure designed for ease of use and to eliminate movement of tensioned components once locked in position.
Claims We claim: 1. A robot drive assembly comprising multiple, concentric vertically nested spindles mounted in a frame, said frame mountable to a fixed surface, each spindle independently driven in a rotational manner around a central axis common to all said spindles, each spindle, through a series of pulleys and drive belts functioning to provide controlled motion to a particular portion of a jointed robot arm, said robot arm and robot arm portions operatively connected to independently move in a rotational path around said central axis, each said spindle being driven by one of three separate controllable spindle drive motors, said motors mounted adjacent to the spindles, said frame with enclosed spindles and motors simultaneously moveable in a vertical direction, the vertical movement of the frame being driven by a fourth motor mounted adjacent to said spindle drive motors, the robot drive assembly capable of moving an operating tool mounted on the distal end of the robot arm through at least a 360.degree. arc around the central axis while also moving a preset distance vertically from the fixed surface such that a tool mounted on the distal end of the robot arm can be moved in the X, Y, Z and Theta direction. 2. The robot drive assembly of claim 1 wherein a first of said controllable spindle drive motors causes rotation of a first of said nested spindles, in turn causing horizontal rotation of the robot arm around the central axis common to the vertically nested spindles, a second of said controllable spindle drive motors causes rotation of a second of said nested spindles, in turn causing rotation of a robot forearm at an elbow joint in the robot arm, and a third of said controllable spindle drive motors causes rotation of a third of said nested spindles, in turn causing rotation of a wrist joint at a distal end of the robot arm, each of said spindle drive motors operating independently from the other spindle drive motors.
