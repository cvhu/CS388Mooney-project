A fugitive pattern of an article to be investment cast wherein the pattern includes a plurality of locator embossments disposed in an array to provide a datum reference system by which the pattern can be held and positioned by a manipulator, such as for example a gripper device to a computer controlled robotic device, for assembly with another component of the pattern assembly. The datum embossments are located on a portion of the pattern that will be removed from the final metallic casting made to replicate the pattern. The casting includes integral cast datum embossments thereon by which the casting can be held and positioned.
Claims I claim: 1. A gripper device adapted to pick up a fugitive pattern at a plurality of locators on said pattern, comprising a plurality of gripper arms for receiving a respective one of the locators, and a heating device movable mounted on said device and movable to a position spaced below a surface of said pattern. 2. The device of claim 1 including a distance sensor for sensing distance between said gripper device and a surface area where the pattern will be attached to another component. 3. The device of claim 1 wherein one of said arms is movable and others of said arms are fixed on said gripper device. 4. The device of claim 1 wherein each of said arms includes a recess to receive a respective locator. 5. The device of claim 3 wherein said one of said arms is connected to a fluid cylinder on said gripper device to move said arm. 6. The device of claim 1 wherein said heating device comprises an electrical resistance heating element in a heating iron. 7. The device of claim 1 wherein said heating device is disposed on a pivotal arm disposed on said gripper device. 8. The device of claim 7 wherein said pivotal arm is connected to a fluid cylinder on said gripper device to pivot said arm. 9. The device of claim 1 having a coupling for connection to a robotic motion device.
