A high throughput chemical screening method uses methods of concurrent transport and/or processing to increase throughput. A screener may concurrently retrieve chemicals from an addressable chemical storage module and deliver chemicals to a liquid handling module. The screener may also use one transport lane for moving chemicals away from a storage module, and a second transport lane for moving chemicals toward the storage module.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of screening drug candidate compounds for activity comprising: storing a set of drug candidate compounds in a plurality of multiwell plates; programming a chemical storage and retrieval module containing said multiwell plates for the selection of a subset of said drug candidate compounds; retrieving a first multiwell plate from said chemical storage module with an automated robotic retriever and placing it in said buffer integral to said automated robotic retriever; retrieving a second multiwell plate from said chemical storage module with said automated robotic retriever and placing it in said buffer integral to said automated robotic retriever; delivering said first and second multiwell plates to an automated transport pathway. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the set of drug candidate compounds are stored in addressable chemical wells on the plurality of multiwell plates and the programmed subset of drug candidate compounds are retrieved with a liquid handler from fewer than all of the addressable chemical wells of the retrieved multiwell plates. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein the subset of said drug candidate compounds are returned to said chemical storage module. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein said first and second multiwell plates are stacked in said buffer. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein said buffer comprises a sorter. 6. The method of claim 1 wherein said buffer comprises a rack system.
