An automated storage library structure, a structure of at least one robot operating within the automated storage library, and a method of connecting the robot to test equipment to facilitate testing. The robot is operative to move about the automated storage library on a guide structure. The test equipment is disposed in a diagnostics center associated with the automated storage library. Communication between the robot and the diagnostics center is provided through a main connector, disposed adjacent to the guide structure at a predetermined position and electrically connected to the diagnostics center, and a test connector mounted on the robot's chassis and electrically connected to the robot's electronics. A second robot may be used to support testing of a sick robot. Support includes pushing or pulling a sick robot to the mating connector, providing an alternate communication path between the sick robot and the diagnostics center exclusive of the main connector, and conducting tests on the sick robot in place of the diagnostics center. Test equipment at the diagnostics center may include optical test equipment as well as electrical.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated storage library comprising: a main connector; a diagnostic center connected to the main connector; and a robot having a test connector, the robot being operative to mate the test connector and the main connector to enable the diagnostic center to test the robot. 2. The automated storage library of claim 1 further comprising a transceiver disposed on the robot to enable communications between the robot and the diagnostic center while the test connector is isolated from the main connector.
