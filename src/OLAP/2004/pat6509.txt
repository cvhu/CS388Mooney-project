Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 87 or 89 which inhibits the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase is inhibited. 14. A compound consisting of SEQ ID NO: 27 or 55.
