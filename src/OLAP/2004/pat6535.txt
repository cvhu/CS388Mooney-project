A motor control method and apparatus produce rapid, point-to-point movement while minimizing settling time and peak power consumption in a servo-control system with a periodic input. Rapid open-loop movement is combined with tuning of the open-loop input based on position and velocity of the output when the loop is closed. Iterative learning control is used to adjust open-loop commands in subsequent cycles to reduce residual vibrations and quickly reach the desired final position. The apparatus and method can be used in motion control applications requiring rapid, periodic, point-to-point movement, such as weather satellite servo systems with a periodic input containing multiple step responses within each period.
