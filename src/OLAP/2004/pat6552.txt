External state detection device detects an environmental state indicating whether there is an obstacle, external light, or a pheromone signal. On the basis of the detection result, sensor identification unit determining device determines an identifying unit that matches the environmental state. In response to determination of the sensor identifying unit, action units defining actions such as "move forward" or "move backward" related to the sensor identifying unit in an instruction unit are sequentially selected. Action unit execution device executes the action defined by the selected action unit for a preassigned execution time by rotating left and right leg driving wheels in a driving mode including a combination of "forward rotation", reverse rotation", and "stop". Thus, there is provided an insect robot for simulating behavior in a vivid and realistic manner.
