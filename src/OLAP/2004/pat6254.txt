A system for storing, restoring and distributing video-films, based on optical disks of very high definition, that makes use of DVD disks (Digital Versatile Disk) as a support for the storing of films, so that said films may be stored onto said disks in a compressed format according to the MPEG-2 standard, and where the algorithm allows to modify the compression factor according to the requested quality from a few Mbps to a considerable number of Mbps.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for storing and restoring video-films, based on optical disks of very high definition, characterized in a DVD archive (1) based onto a juke-box that realizes the storing and handling functions of DVDs, consisting of a robotic system that can electronically run and mechanically handle a number of disks, so as to eliminate all operations that previously were performed manually with cassettes and tapes; the checking system of the juke-box transfers the content of the chosen films to the hard-disks of the video server; a video server (2) into which the films recorded on the DVDs, and not directly used for the production of the requested video signal, are being transferred; usage points of the signal are provided with video connections with the video server, based onto ultra-quick SCSI disks and run by a dedicated microprocessor, so as to be able to receive video films from the DVD archive and to send them to an outlet module; the outlet module (3) that integrates outlet cards of the non-compressed analog/digital kind and of the standard DVD multiplex MPEG-2 kind; cards for a non-compressed analog/digital outlet which convert the analog/digital signal into a standard PAL or NTSC signal, according to the features of the recorded video, and the outlet of which synchronized with other video signal sources (gen-lockable) and usually is supplied in composite, optionally in components and in analog; outlet cards MPEG-2 that do not convert the MPEG-2 flow coming from the readers, but which combine a plurality of flows containing one single film (single program transport stream) into one single outlet flow containing all films (multiple program transport stream); the lay-out and the flow combination manner are run by the control system according to the needs of the user, while the outlet flow is supplied onto a Low Voltage Differential Signal or an Asynchronous Serial Interface, as provided by the Digital Video Broadcasting standard; a console (7) for running said system provided with the usage points of the signal, from which it is possible to perform searches in the archive and to check the loading and the playout of the requested films, while the managing of the digital video source takes place with operations similar to those of a professional video-recorder; an inlet module (6) for recording new audio/video contents, consisting of a system for the compression of the video signal into MPEG-2 and the further mastering of the DVD support so that, once the DVD has been recorded, it may be inserted into the juke-box and is ready for use while, at the same time, it will be indexed according to its content and by key-words, for an easy finding in the search operations; a register (4) in which all films are inserted and indexed according to their content, author, date and with key-words so as to allow a quick finding in the search operations, realized by a PC with a server outline and registration hardware, that may be remotely consulted by the consoles placed in the points in which the video signal is used for the search of the contents and by the inlet module for the insertion of new titles; a control system (5) that manages and synchronizes the functioning of all components of the system, having a unique external control interface, so that the whole system is run locally through a graphic interface or remote through the transmission of command onto serial or net interface; said system is in interface condition with the archive for the recording of the content of the system's DVDs, for performing its control and coordination functions; the system is automatically updated each time DVDs are loaded or eliminated from the system; a software management: as all blocks of the system have electronics and software for the remote control, and as a data net provides for the connection of the different system blocks, the whole DVD archive is run only in computerized and automatized manner, so that from each utilization console it is possible to enter all functions of the system; a juke-box software, which has the purpose of performing management and control operations of the robot: the disks' archive is run by means of a logic interface that puts the control software of the juke-box into communication with the database for the management and search of the titles, so that the user automatically and intuitively consults the whole DVDs archive according to the functions provided. 2. A system for storing and restoring video-films, based on optical disks of very high definition according to claim 1, characterized in that said user console (7) allows all control and managing operations of the different under-systems through data connection by means of ATM net (11), and further allows the use of the video signals in output from the system through the video net (8). 3. A system according to claim 1, characterized in a robot (16) for the handling of DVD disks, in which the sliding on the horizontal axis is guided by tracks which allow quick movements, while mechanic arms handle four DVD disks and transfer them from the DVD collection (12) to the readers (13) with an entering time that varies from two to seven seconds. 4. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that said video server (2), to which the outlet signals from the archives are sent through the standard ATM net interface (14), consists of a system that makes available the films contained in the juke box for the treatment in a standard video format and for the sharing, while the control system thereof is performed by means of a graphic interface directly from the consoles of the two cutting rooms. 5. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that said outlet module (3) integrates cards for analogic/non-compressed digital outlet and of the standard multiplex MPEG-2 DVB kind. 6. A system according to claim 1, characterized in cards for the analogic and non-compressed digital outlet, which turn the flow coming from the video server (22) into a standard television signal (27) of the PAL or NTSC kind according to the features of the stored video, while the inlet signal is run by the control unit of the high speed signal (17) and is addressed to the data signal commuter/separator (18) which sends them to the MPEG-2 decoder (25) according to the commands sent by the control system of the outlet module (20), and the decoded signal is then sent to the analogic outlet cards (26). 7. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the digital outlet cards don't change the MPEG-2 flow coming from the readers, but they combine a plurality of flows (22) containing one single film (single program transport stream) into one single outlet flow (23) containing all films (multiple program transport stream), while the combination of the flows is realized by means of the adaptation units of the data signal (19), which have the task to assure a data flow at a constant speed, and the multiplying unit (21) materially combines the digital flows by calculating the outlet flow's parameters according to the outline set on the central control system and transmitted, through the control interface (24), to the control system of the outlet module. 8. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the outline of the card and the combination possibilities of the flows are run by the control system (20) according to the needs of the user, while the outlet flow (23) is supplied onto an LVDS or ASI interface according to the DVB standard. 9. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that said central control system (5) manages and synchronizes the functioning of all components of the system with one single external control interface. 10. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the connections between the modules of the system are divided into two fundamental parts: data connections, for running the control flows (11) and the monitoring of the devices, and for the transfer of the MPEG films (9) and (10) onto the video servers, realized in LAN ATM technology; video connections (8), for the transport of audio and video signals from the video servers to the devices in the cutting room, realized in a coaxial cable.
