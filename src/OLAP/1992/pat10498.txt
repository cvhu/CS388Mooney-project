The positional error of a robotic manipulator (20,22) within its workspace (38) can be reduced by advantageously mapping the manipulator positional error at each of a plurality of grid points (44) within the workspace. Such mapping is carried out by placing a grid (40) containing uniformly spaced grid points (44) in the workspace and then measuring the manipulator error at each grid point. From the map of manipulator positional error values, the manipulator positional error at any point in the workspace can easily be obtained by interpolation.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for compensating a robotic manipulator for positional error when the robotic manipulator is to be displaced, in succession, to each of a plurality of work locations where the manipulator is to perform work, comprising the steps of: (a) establishing a positional error for the robotic manipulator at each of a plurality of spaced grid points whose locations are known to the manipulator by (1) displacing the robotic manipulator to locate an image acquisition device on the manipulator in aligned registration with a successive one of the grid points; (2) checking if the image acquisition device has the center of its field of view in aligned registration with the centroid of the grid point within a predetermined tolerance factor; and, if not, then successively displacing the manipulator to locate the center of the field of view of the image acquisition device closer to the centroid of the grid point and re-checking if the image acquisition device is in such aligned registration with the grid point; (3) establishing the positional error for the robotic manipulator at the grid point in accordance with the difference between the known grid point location and the manipulator position once the image acquisition device has the center of its field of view in aligned registration with the successive grid point; (b) displacing the manipulator to each successive work location to perform work; (c) determining, at each such successive work location, the actual manipulator error in accordance with the manipulator error at each of a predetermined number of grid point locations closest to such successive work location; and (d) compensating the robotic manipulator by an amount equal to the actual degree of manipulator error. 2. A method for establishing an error map for a robotic manipulator which indicates the manipulator error at each of a plurality of spaced grid points within a workspace, comprising the steps of: (a) placing an alignment grid, having a plurality of uniformly spaced grid points therein, within a workspace associated with a robotic manipulator; (b) displacing the robotic manipulator into registration with a successive one of the grid points on the grid; (c) measuring how far the manipulator is from the grid point by the steps of: (i) measuring how far the centroid of the grid point is from the center of the field of view of an image-acquisition device attached to the manipulator; (ii) moving the manipulator closer to the grid point centroid if the distance between the grid point centroid and the centroid of the image-acquisition device field of view is greater than a predetermined tolerance factor; (iii) repeating the steps of (i) and (ii) until the grid point centroid is in substantial registration with the centroid of the image-acquisition device field of view, at which time the location of the grid point centroid can be established from the manipulator position and the position of the image-acquisition device from the manipulator; (d) storing the distance from the manipulator to the associated grid point; and (e) repeating the steps of (b)-(d) until the manipulator error associated with each of the grid points is measured.
