A body welding station receives a succession of differing body component parts in order to weld such component parts into an integrated body structure of differing styles. A fixture frame has clamping and locating fixtures mounted thereon by disconnectable fixture holding devices which permit the individual and selective removal of certain of the fixtures from the fixture frame and permit the mounting of different fixtures thereon for the subsequent clamping and locating of body components for a body structure of different style. A fixture changing station is located remote from the welding station and has associated fixture storage apparatus storing additional fixtures therein. A transport apparatus moves the fixture frame between the welding station and the fixture changing station. A programmable fixture changing robot is adapted to individually disconnect certain of the fixtures from the fixture frame and then mount different fixtures thereon so that the fixture frame may be returned to the welding station for fixturing of the next of the successive body structures to be welded therein. The fixtures may have electrical and fluid power sensors and clamping apparatus associated therewith, in which case the fixture holding devices includes disconnectable electrical connectors and fluid power connectors adapted to mate with mating connectors mounted on the fixture frame to communicate control and power signals between the fixture frame and the particular fixture mounted on the fixture frame.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A body assembly system of the type having a welding station receiving a succession of differing body component parts to weld such components into integrated body structures of a different type, comprising: a fixture frame having a plurality of fixtures mounted thereon to clamp and locate the component parts in predetermined position within the welding station, welding means fixedly and immovably adapted to apply welds to the positioned component parts, disconnectable fixture holding means mounting said fixtures on the fixture frame and permitting removal of said fixtures from the fixture frame and permitting the mounting of different fixtures thereon for the subsequent clamping and locating of the body components for a different body structure, and programmable fixture changing robot means adapted to disconnect said fixtures from the fixture frame and mount different fixtures thereon for the welding of the next of the successive body structures to be welded. 2. A body assembly system of the type having a welding station receiving a succession of differing body component parts to weld such components into integrated body structures of a different type, comprising: a fixture frame having fixtures mounted thereon to clamp and locate the component parts in predetermined position within the welding station, programmable welding robot means adapted to apply welds to the positioned component parts; transport means for moving the fixture frame away from the welding station, disconnectable fixture holding means fixedly and immovably mounting said fixtures on the fixture of frame and permitting removal of said fixtures from the fixture frame and permitting the mounting of different fixtures fixedly and immovably thereon for the subsequent clamping and locating of the body components for a body structure of differing type, and programmable fixture changing robot means being located away from the welding station and adapted to disconnect said fixtures from the fixture frame when the transport means moves the fixture frame away from the welding station, and mount different fixtures thereon for the welding of the next of the successive body structures to be welded. 3. A car body assembly system of the type having a welding station receiving a succession of differing body component parts to weld such components into integrated body structures of differing types, comprising: a fixture frame having particular fixtures mounted thereon to clamp and locate the component parts of a particular one of the differing styles in predetermined position within the welding station, programmable welding robot means adapted to apply welds to the position component parts, a fixture changing station located remote from the welding station and having associated storage means storing additional fixtures adapted for mounting on the fixture frame for the clamping and locating of the component parts of additional one or more different types to be welded, transport means for moving the fixture frame between the welding station and the fixture changing station, disconnectable fixture holding means individually mounting said particular fixtures on the fixture frame and permitting removal of said particular fixtures from the fixture frame and permitting the mounting of different of the additional fixtures thereon for the subsequent clamping and locating of the body components for a body structure of differing type, and programmable fixture changing robot means adapted to individually disconnect said fixtures from the fixture frame and mount different fixtures thereon in preparation for the welding of the next of the successive body structures to be welded when the transport means moves the fixture frame back to the welding station. 4. A body assembly system of the type having a welding station receiving a succession of differing body component parts to weld such components into integrated body structures of differing types, comprising: a fixture frame having fixtures mounted thereon and including sensors and motors of the electrical and fluid power type to clamp and locate the component parts in predetermined position within the welding station, programmable welding robot means adapted to apply welds in a predetermined manner to the particular component parts positioned within the welding station, transport means for moving the fixture frame away from the welding station, a plurality of disconnectable fixture holding means mounting said fixtures on the fixture frame and permitting removal of said fixtures from the fixture frame and permitting the mounting of different fixtures thereon for the subsequent clamping and locating of the body components for a body structure of differing type, each of said holding means having disconnectable electrical connectors and fluid power connectors adapted to made with mating connectors mounted on the fixture frame to communicate control and power signals between the fixture frame and the particular fixture mounted on the fixture frame, and programmable fixture changing robot means adapted to disconnect the fixture holding means and the associated connectors from the fixture frame and remove the fixtures and mount different fixtures thereon for the welding of the most of the successive body structures to be welded. 5. A method for welded assembly of a vehicle body in a welding station receiving a succession of differing body component parts to weld such components into integrated body structures of differing styles, comprising: disconnectably mounting a first plurality of fixtures on a fixture frame, said fixtures being suited to clamp and locate the component parts of a particular body style in a predetermined position within the welding station, positioning the fixture frame in the welding station with the first plurality of fixtures clamping and locating the component parts, applying welds to the positioned component parts in the welding station, removing the fixture frame away from the welding station, robotically exchanging fixtures by disconnecting certain of the first plurality of fixtures from the fixture frame and installing certain other fixtures thereon, said other fixtures being suited to clamp and locate the component parts of a next body of different type to be welded in the welding station, and returning the fixture frame to the welding station.
