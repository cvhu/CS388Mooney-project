A combination work supporting table and computer controlled robot wherein, preferably, a rotatable index table includes a concentric column having a computer controlled robot mounted upon the column outer end in spaced relationship to the table work supporting surface. A computerized robot controller controls both the robot and the rotation of the index table permitting an extensive range of robot movement over a large work area in a concise space.
Claims We claim: 1. In combination, a base, a rotatable index table having an axis of rotation and a work supporting surface substantially perpendicular to said axis of rotation mounted on said base, motor means selectively rotating said index table on said base about said axis of rotation, electrical sensing means defined on said base and index table indicating the rotative position of said table with respect to said base, a column mounted on said base extending from said work supporting surface substantially concentric to said axis having an outer end spaced from said work supporting surface, a computer controlled rotatable robotic tool mounted on said column outer end, said computer controlled robotic tool comprising a robot consisting of a plurality of servo-motor powered arms, a computer control operatively connected to said robotic tool, said electrical sensing means and said motor means, said computer control operating said robotic tool and rotating said index table in a programmed manner to cause said robotic tool to work on work pieces mounted on said work supporting surface. 2. In a combination as in claim 1, means rotatably mounting said robotic tool upon said column outer end for rotation concentric to said table axis of rotation. 3. In combination, an index table having a base, bearings mounted on said base defining an axis of rotation, a work supporting table mounted in said bearings having a rotation axis co-axial with said bearings' axis of rotation and a work supporting surface, a central opening defined in said work supporting surface substantially concentric to said bearings' axis of rotation, a column support defined on said base alignment with said opening, a column mounted in said column support extending through said opening and having an outer end in spaced relation to said work supporting surface, a computer controlled robotic tool mounted on said column upper end for rotation about said table rotation axis, a computer control operatively connected to said robotic tool, said computer controlled robotic tool comprising a robot consisting of a base collar mounted on said column upper end, a plurality of servo-motor powered arms supported by said base collar and motor means operatively connected to said work supporting table for selectively rotating said table about said rotation axis, said computer control controlling operation of said motor means and rotation of said work supporting table, electrical sensing means defined on said base and work supporting table indicating the rotative position of said table with respect to said base, said sensing means being electrically connected to said computer control. 4. In the combination as in claim 3, said base collar being rotatably mounted on said column upper end.
