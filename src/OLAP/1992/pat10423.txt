Workpoint torque control is employed in an electron multiaxis robot controller. Robot axis torque is determined from axis motor current feedback. Axis torque requests are based on torque command and torque feedback in an axis torque control mode or on the basis of position, velocity and torque commands and position, velocity and torque feedback in a combined position/torque control mode, or an indirect torque control mode.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electronic control for a robot having end effector means and further having multiple axes each having a joint drive motor supplied by a power amplifier, said control comprising: means for generating position and velocity commands for each robot axis, thereby defining the operation of the robot end effector; means for generating position and velocity feedback signals for each robot axis; means for generating a motor torque command for each axis; means for generating a motor torque request for each axis as a function of position and velocity errors between command and feedback values and as a function of the motor torque command; means for generating a signal representing motor and current supplied by the power amplifier for each axis; and means for generating a voltage drive signal for each power amplifier as a function of any error between the torque request and the current feedback for the corresponding robot axis, said torque command generating means and said position command generating means are jointly implemented in trajectory planning means so that generated position commands reflect torque commands along the path of robot end effector motion. 2. An electronic control for a robot having end effector means and further having multiple axes each having a joint drive motor supplied by a power amplifier, said control comprising: means for generating position and velocity commands for each robot axis, thereby defining the operation of the robot and effector; means for generating position and velocity feedback signals for each robot axis; means for generating a motor torque command for each axis; means for generating a motor torque request for each axis as a function of position and velocity errors between command and feedback values and as a function of the motor torque command; means for generating a signal representing motor and current supplied by the power amplifier for each axis; and means for generating a voltage drive signal for each power amplifier as a function of any error between the torque request and the current feedback for the corresponding robot axis; wherein at least one robot world axis corresponds to one joint axis; and said motor torque request generating means functions only in response to said torque command generating means for said one axis when said one axis is placed in a workpoint torque control mode. 3. An electronic control for a robot having end effector means and further having multiple axes each having a joint drive motor supplied by a power amplifier, said control comprising: means for generating position and velocity commands for each robot axis, thereby defining the operation of the robot end effector; means for generating position and velocity feedback signals for each robot axis; means for generating a motor torque command for each axis; means for generating a motor torque request for each axis as a function of position and velocity errors between command and feedback values and as a function of the motor torque command; means for generating a signal representing motor and current supplied by the power amplifier for each axis; and means for generating a voltage drive signal for each power amplifier as a function of any error between the torque request and the current feedback for the corresponding robot axis; means for determining torque error along one or more torque controlled world axes as a function of the joint axes current feedback and torque commands for the torque controlled world axes; and means for initiating connective position moves through said position command generating means. 4. An electronic robot controller as set forth in claim 3, wherein the controlled path motion is over a world X-Z plane and the world Y and Z axes are torque controlled.
