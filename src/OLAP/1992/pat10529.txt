An automated facility for the large-scale production of superconducting magnets for use in a particle accelerator. Components of the automated facility include: a superconducting coil winding machine; a coil form and cure press apparatus; a coil collaring press; collar pack assembly apparatus; yoke half stacking apparatus; a cold mass assembly station; and a final assembly station. The facility can produce, on an economical manufacturing basis, magnets made of superconducting material for use in the ring of the particle accelerator. Each of the components is under the control of a programmable controller for operation having repeatable accuracy. All of the elements which are combined to form the superconducting magnet are thus manufactured with the dimensional precision required to produce a known, uniform magnetic field within the accelerator.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of constructing a particle accelerator having superconducting properties, said method comprising the steps of: winding superconducting material into a plurality of inner coils and a plurality of outer coils, said inner and outer coils having a fixed shape; placing a tubular member between said inner and outer coils; placing said inner and outer coils with the tubular member therein within a collaring member to form a collared coil subassembly; securing said collared coil subassemblies between a pair of U-shaped yoke half assemblies and a pair of arcuate-shaped shell members to form a cold mass assembly; positioning said cold mass assembly in a vacuum vessel assembly having a cooling tube, through which is passed a cryogenic fluid, disposed therein, to thereby form a superconducting magnet; joining a plurality of said superconducting magnets into a ring-shaped structure, whereby a particle accelerator having superconducting properties is constructed.
