A gripping assembly (30) for use with a robotic arm (12) in withdrawing articles (16) from a molding machine (14) is disclosed. The gripping assembly (30) includes an L-shaped block (24) slidingly attached to a gripping mechanism (10) and biased therefrom by coil springs (26) positioned therebetween.
Claims We claim: 1. A gripping assembly for use with a robotic arm in removing molded articles from a molding machine, said gripping assembly comprising: a gripping mechanism having closable plates at one end for gripping an article being ejected from a molding machine; an L-shaped block having a base and a leg extending outwardly from said base, said leg being provided with a longitudinal groove and a spacer plate slidably positioned in said groove and a longitudinal slot in said groove and extending through said leg with a bolt passing through said plate and slot whereby said block is slidably attached to one side of said gripping mechanism with said base crossing and spaced from a second end of said gripping mechanism, said block being adapted for attachment to a robotic art; and coil springs positioned between said gripping mechanism and said base of said block for resiliently biasing said mechanism and block apart while permitting reciprocal motion of one relative to the other.
