A multiple metallic core assembly for use in production of a plastic injection-molded component is formed by injecting molten metal alloy into a core die at a fill stage of an indexing system, indexing the core die through a cooling stage to an unloading stage, and removing the core from the core die and inserting the core in one of a plurality of locations of the core assembly. Individual cores are continued to be formed as discussed above until all the locations of the core assembly are filled, and the core assembly is complete. Therefore, the core assembly is removed and transported to a plastic molding machine to produce the plastic component. Then, the core assembly is melted out from the plastic component in hot oil, and the molten metal alloy produced thereby is returned to a molten metal alloy tank.
Claims The embodiments of the present invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method of forming multiple metallic cores into a core assembly for use in production of a plastic injection-molded component, said method comprising the steps of: a) providing a tank containing molten metal alloy, b) injecting molten metal alloy supplied from the molten metal tank into at least one core die located at a fill stage of an indexing means, c) indexing the core die through a cooling stage to an unloading stage, d) removing a core formed in the core die therefrom by robotic handling means and inserting the core into one of a plurality of locations in the core assembly, e) continuing forming individual cores as set forth in steps b-d until all locations of the plurality of locations are filled, and the core assembly is complete, f) removing the complete core assembly and transporting the core assembly to a plastic molding machine to produce the plastic component, and g) melting the core assembly out from the produced plastic component in hot oil and returning the molten alloy produced thereby to the molten metal alloy-containing tank. 2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the core assembly is rotated a predetermined angular displacement between each insertion of a core. 3. A method of forming multiple metallic cores into a core assembly for use in production of a plastic injection-molded component, said method comprising the steps of: a) providing a tank containing molten metal alloy, b) injecting molten metal alloy supplied from the molten metal tank into a core die located at a fill stage of an indexing means, c) indexing the core die through a cooling stage to an unloading stage, d) removing a core formed in the core die therefrom and inserting the core into one of a plurality of locations in the core assembly, e) continuing forming individual cores as set forth in steps b-d until all locations of the plurality of locations are filled, and the core assembly is complete, f) transporting the complete core assembly to a plastic molding machine to produce the plastic component, and g) melting the core assembly out from the produced plastic component in hot oil and returning the molten alloy produced thereby to the molten metal alloy-containing tank.
