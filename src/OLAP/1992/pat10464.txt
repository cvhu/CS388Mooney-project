The present invention provides an apparatus and method of a feeder for singulating and feeding various shaped sized and shaped parts without major modification. The present invention also provides an arrangement which utilizes the feeder.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method for compiling parts into individual kits made up of a first number of unique parts, a plurality of each said unique part being stored in bulk, in a non-singulated, non-orientated manner, in an individual separate first bin, said method in combination comprising: loading with a robot one of a third number of vibrational fabric oriented feeder means with a bulk of the first unique parts from said first bin; singulating said first unique parts from said feeder means, by moving said first unique parts up a vibrational fabric orientated inclined ramp and thereby causing non-singulated parts to return down the ramp, to one of a second number of vibrational fabric oriented diverting means, said second number being lower than said first number; delivering said first unique parts from said diverting means to a separate nest by a vibrational oriented fabric conveyor; manipulating said first unique parts from said nest to a kitting tray with a robot; relieving said first unique parts from said feeder means by opening a normally closed gate allowing the first unique parts to escape from the vibrational fabric oriented inclined ramp; loading said feeder means with at least second unique parts in a manner similar of the loading of the first unique parts; singulating said second unique parts to said diverting means in a manner similar to the singulating of the first unique parts; delivering said second unique parts from said diverter means to a separate nest in a manner similar to the delivering of the first unique parts; manipulating said second unique parts from said second magazines means to said kitting tray in a manner similar to the manipulating of the first unique parts.
