An intervention vehicle of the type comprising propulsion units (4) that are tiltable by rotation about transverse carrying shafts (66), comprising advance and tilting driven shafts (8, 9) disposed coaxially inside each carrying shaft (66) and transmitting their motion via linear transmission elements (84, 90, 98) inside each propulsion unit for driving advance motion and tilting motion, and also constituting a speed reducer for the tilting motion. The invention is particularly applicable to the nuclear industry.
Claims We claim: 1. An intervention vehicle comprising: (a) a vehicle body (2) having a length and a width extending respectively along a longitudinal direction (X) and a transverse direction (Y); (b) propulsion units (4, 6) resting on the ground in operation to suport said vehicle body and to have an advance motion along said longitudinal direction; (c) said vehicle comprising for each of said propulsion units (4): (i) a propulsion unit carrying shaft (66) carried by said vehicle body (2) and carrying a propulsion unit housing (68, 70) while enabling it to perform a tilting motion (62) on command about a transverse tilting axis (64) of said propulsion unit; (ii) an advance motor (10) and a tilting motor (12) carried by said vehicle body (2); and (iii) an advance driven shaft (8) and a tilting driven shaft (9) driven by said advance motor and by said tilting motor, respectively, and extending coaxially into said propulsion unit along said tilting axis inside said propulsion unit carrying shaft; (d) each said propulsion unit further comprising: (i) an advance wheel (72) guided to rotate relative to said propulsion unit housing (68, 70) about a transverse axis at a distance from said tilting axis in such a manner as to impart said advance motion to said propulsion unit; (ii) internal advance transmission means (82, 84, 86) for driving said advance wheel from said advance driven shaft (8); and (iii) internal tilting transmission means; (e) said internal tilting transmission means comprising (i) a first drive wheel (88) mounted on said tilting driven shaft beyond said carrying shaft (66) for rotating at a first tilting transmission angular speed; (ii) a first linear transmission element (90) driven by said first wheel; (iii) an intermediate shaft (92) extending transversely and guided to rotate relative to said propulsion unit housing; (iv) a first driven wheel (94) mounted on said intermediate shaft and driven by said first linear transmission element to rotate said shaft; (v) a second drive wheel (96) mounted on said intermediate shaft; (vi) a second linear transmission element (98) driven by said second drive wheel; and (viii) a tilting support driven wheel (100) cooperating with said second transmission element and fixed, at least angularly, on said carrying shaft to cause said intermediate shaft and said propulsion unit housing to rotate about said carrying shaft in such a manner as to drive said tilting motion at a tilting angular speed which is less than said first tilting transmission angular speed. 2. A vehicle according to claim 1, wherein each of said propulsion units (4) stands on the ground over a ground support distance (58) which extends along said longitudinal direction, with the propulsion unit being capable of bearing against the ground to support said vehicle body at any point of said ground support distance (58). 3. A vehicle according to claim 1, wherein said first and second drive wheels (88, 96) of the internal tilting transmission means have smaller diameters than said first and second driven wheels (94, 100), respectively. 4. A vehicle according to claim 1, wherein said ground support assembly in each of said lateral propulsion units comprises: (a) a crawler track (80) bearing against the ground; (b) means (72, 74, 76, 78) for guiding said crawler track; and (c) an advance wheel (72) rotating about a transverse axis for driving said track. 5. A vehicle according to claim 4, wherein said internal advance transmission means comprise: (a) a drive wheel (82) carried by said advance driven shaft (8) beyond said carrying shaft (66); (b) a linear transmission element (84) driven by said drive wheel; and (c) a driven wheel (86) fixed to said advance wheel (72) and driven by said transmission element to drive advance motion of said propulsion unit (4).
