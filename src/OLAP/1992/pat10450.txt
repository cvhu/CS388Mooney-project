The present invention provides a holding fixture which is best utilized when installing a closed loop fixed length of weather stripping. The fixture as provided improves a robot weather stripping system by decreasing the rate of unacceptable applications and decreasing the criticality of the weather stripping parameters by holding the weather stripping in a unique manner during installation.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A holding fixture used in conjunction with a robot having an arm with a powered pressured roller attached at an end of said arm for installing a closed loop fixed length of weather stripping into a body opening, said fixtures in combination comprising: stand means generally laterally offset from said body opening; a pivot arm pivotally connected with said stand means and projecting therefrom, said pivot arm projecting into said fixed length holding a portion of said fixed length in a position laterally offset from said opening upon an initial installment of said fixed length into said body opening by said robot arm; a first spring means biasing said pivot arm; a finger pivotally connected to an end of said pivot arm opposite said pivotal connection of said pivot arm with said stand means whereby said finger prevents the escapement of said fixed length from said fixture upon pivotal movement of said pivot arm caused by the installation of said fixed length within said body opening, and said finger holding said fixed length laterally from said body opening and tensioning said fixed length as said robot arm pressure roller further installs said weather stripping during latter stages of said fixed length installation in said opening to allow said fixed length to escape from said fixture allowing said robot to complete the installation of said fixed length into said body opening; and a second spring means biasing said finger.
