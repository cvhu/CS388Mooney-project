A data processing device includes an electronic processor responsive to a context signal and operable in alternative processing contexts identified by the context signal. First and second registers are connected to the electronic processor to participate in one processing context while retaining information from another processing context until a return thereto. A context switching circuit is connected to the first and second registers and operates to selectively control input and output operations of the registers to and from the electronic processor depending on the processing context. Other devices, systems and methods are also disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A data processing device used with a circuit that produces a digital signal to be processed and an interrupt signal indicating that the digital signal is available for processing, the data processing device comprising; a data bus; an arithmetic logic unit connected to said data bus; an accumulator connected between said arithmetic logic unit and said data bus; a counterpart register, for the accumulator, coupled to the data bus; switching means, connected to said accumulator and to said counterpart register, for supplying digital values to the accumulator and also for holding a current digital value in the counterpart register upon an occurrence of the interrupt signal while continuing to supply the accumulator with another digital value during an interrupt routine; a multiplier connected to said data bus; a product register connected between said multiplier and said arithmetic logic unit; a product counterpart register connected between said multiplier and said arithmetic logic unit; and additional switching means, connected to said product register and to said product counterpart register, for supplying digital product values to the product register and holding a current digital product value in the product counterpart register when the interrupt signal occurs, while continuing to supply the product counterpart register with another digital product value from the multiplier during the interrupt routine. 2. A data processing device used with a circuit that produces a digital signal to be processed and an interrupt signal indicating that the digital signal is available for processing, the data processing device comprising: a data bus; an arithmetic logic unit connected to said data bus; an accumulator connected between said arithmetic logic unit and said data bus; a counterpart register, for the accumulator, coupled to the data bus; switching means, connected to said accumulator and to said counterpart register, for supplying digital values to the accumulator and also for holding a current digital value in the counterpart register upon an occurrence of the interrupt signal while continuing to supply the accumulator with another digital value during an interrupt routine; additional processing circuitry connected to said data bus; a set of first registers interconnecting the data bus, the arithmetic logic unit and the additional processing circuitry; a set of second register connected to said data bus; and switching circuitry for connecting the set of second registers respectively to the first registers until the interrupt signal occurs and then temporarily disconnecting the set of second registers from their corresponding first registers when the interrupt signal occurs. 3. A data processing device used with a circuit that produces a digital signal to be processed and an interrupt signal indicating that the digital signal is available for processing, the data processing device comprising: a set of first registers and a set of second registers; and a circuit connected to the set of first and second registers, for executing digital signal processing operations by loading and changing values simultaneously in corresponding ones of the first and second registers so that a value is in a particular one of the first registers and the same value is in a corresponding one of the second registers and for responding to the interrupt signal by executing a set of interrupt operations that load and change at least one value in a particular one of the first registers leaving the corresponding one of the second registers unchanged. 4. The data processing device of claim 3 wherein said circuit for executing includes an arithmetic logic unit, wherein the set of first registers includes an accumulator that is supplied with a value from the arithmetic logic unit, and wherein the set of second registers includes a register corresponding to the accumulator. 5.
