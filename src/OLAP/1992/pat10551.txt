A turret comprising a rotating joint and an angular velocity reduction device is disclosed. A tracking turret comprises an angular velocity reduction device with an elliptical wave generator, an externally-toothed flexible ring and an internally-toothed rigid ring, and a rotating joint used for the transmission of electrical signals. The invention can be applied chiefly to the making of close-range anti-aircraft defense turrets.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A turret system carrying at least one weapon system, said turret system comprising: a turret; a first drive motor having a motor shaft for moving a first movable portion of said turret in a first degree of freedom wherein said first drive motor is mechanically coupled with a first harmonic drive rotational velocity reduction device and wherein said first drive motor is further mechanically coupled with a rotating joint wherein said rotating joint includes a means for transmission of electrical signals and energy between at least one fixed device associated with a fixed portion of said turret and at least oen other device associated with said first movable portion of said turret and wherein one part of said rotating joint is fixed on said turret and another part of said rotating joint is both coaxial with said motor shaft and fixed on a driving means; a second drive motor for moving a second movable portion of said turret in a second degree of freedom wherein said second drive motor is mechanically coupled with a second harmonic drive rotational velocity reduction device. 2. A turret according to the claim 1 comprising one of target detection and tracking means. 3. A turret according to the claim 2 comprising video cameras sensitive to one of visible and infra-red radiation. 4. A turret according to the claim 2, comprising a laser telemeter. 5. A turret according to the claim 1 wherein the said turret is an anti-aircraft defence turret.
