A method of matching a golfer's skills to a particular brand of golf balls by first testing a golfer's skills using a golf launch monitor, the data derived from this test being entered into an extensive computerized system of research databases. Further test results are taken for putting comparisons between all brands within the system. A final category known as "the feel index" is also tested and entered into the computer database. Based upon the results and golfer preference towards distance, accuracy, putting and feel, the top brand is selected for that person. This brand is then subjected to a series of air cannon tests to determine the performance characteristics of each ball. The balls are then subdivided into groups and performance rated for consistency.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of matching the skills of a golfer with the performance characteristics of a golf ball brand comprising the steps of: (a) determining an actual performance profile of the golfer using a golf club and golf ball brand used by the golfer by measuring flight characteristics of the golf ball, including distance, ball speed, spin rate and launch angle of a plurality of golf balls actually hit by the golfer and entering the golfer's performance data derived therefrom into a computer database; (b) selecting a group of golf ball brands; (e) determining a coefficient of restitution (COR) by measuring flight characteristics of each of the golf ball brands upon being hit by a hitting block simulating a golf club and entering a calculated COR for each of the golf ball brands into the computer database; (f) determining actual flight characteristics and actual flight consistency of each of the golf ball brands including launch angle, spin rate, ball speed, carry distance, total distance, and offline accuracy when shot from an air cannon and entering the flight data into the computer database; (g) comparing the COR, actual flight characteristics, and consistency of the golf ball brand used by the golfer in step (a) with all of the performance data of the golf ball brands in step (b); (h) establishing a weighted scale of relative importance to the golfer between distance and accuracy (offline performance) based on step (a); (i) determining an ordered group of golf ball brands established in step (g) based upon the weighted scale established in step (h). 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: after step (b), using a putting robot, determining actual putting performance profile of each of the golf ball brands selected and entering the golf ball performance data derived therefrom into the computer database. 3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: after step (b), determining a feel index for each of the golf ball brands by measuring compression and cover hardness for each golf ball brand and entering the feel index data into the computer database. 4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: after step (i), shooting a plurality of identical golf balls of each golf ball brand determined in step (i), the air cannon being adjusted to substantially duplicate the golfer performance profile determined in step (a), to identify the most consistent golf brands for distance and accuracy offline. 5. A method of matching the skills of a golfer with the performance characteristics of a golf ball brand comprising the steps of: (a) determining an actual performance profile of the golfer using a golf club and golf ball brand used by the golfer by measuring flight characteristics of the golf ball, including distance, ball speed, spin rate and launch angle of a plurality of golf balls actually hit by the golfer and entering the golfer's performance data derived therefrom into a computer database; (b) selecting a group of golf ball brands; (c) after step (b), using a putting robot, determining actual putting performance profile of each of the golf ball brands selected and entering the golf ball performance data derived therefrom into the computer database; (d) after step (b), determining a feel index for each of the golf ball brands by measuring compression and cover hardness for each golf ball brand and entering the feel index data into the computer database; (e) determining a coefficient of restitution (COR) by measuring flight characteristics of each of the golf ball brands upon being hit by a hitting block simulating a golf club and entering a calculated COR for each of the golf ball brands into the computer database; (f) determining actual flight characteristics and actual flight consistency of each of the golf ball brands including launch angle, spin rate, ball speed, carry distance, total distance, and offline accuracy when shot from an air cannon and entering the flight data into the computer database; (g) comparing the COR, actual flight characteristics and consistency of the golf ball brand used by the golfer in step (a) with all of the performance data of the golf ball brands in step (b); (h) establishing a weighted scale of relative importance to the golfer between distance and accuracy (offline performance) based on step (a); (i) determining an ordered group of golf ball brands established in step (g) based upon the weighted scale established in step (h); (j) after step (i), shooting a plurality of identical golf balls of each golf ball brand determined in step (i), the air cannon being adjusted to substantially duplicate the golfer performance profile determined in step (a), to identify the most consistent golf brands for distance and accuracy offline.
