Disclosed herein are methods and compositions for modulating HIV infection by regulating expression of one or more receptors.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of down-regulating expression of a CXCR4 receptor in an isolated cell, the method comprising the step of: Expressing, in the isolated cell, a fusion protein comprising a repression domain and at least one engineered zinc finger protein comprising 3 zinc fingers, wherein the zinc finger protein binds to a target site in the non-coding region of a CXCR4 gene, the target site comprising the sequence GNN and further wherein the fusion protein down-regulates expression of the CXCR4 receptor. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the zinc finger protein comprises 6 zinc fingers.
