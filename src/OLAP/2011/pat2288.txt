Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a computing environment, a method comprising: A robot simulation apparatus capable of creating and executing a robot program, comprising: a display means; a virtual space creating means for creating a virtual space on the display means for three-dimensionally expressing a working space in which a robot carries out a handling operation of workpieces; a workpiece model layout means for automatically arranging one or a plurality of workpiece models in appropriate postures at appropriate positions in selected one of a workpiece layout area model defined in the virtual space created by the virtual space creating means and a workpiece accommodation means model arranged in the virtual space, the workpiece model layout means arranges one workpiece model in a posture at a position, which are determined using a random number, above the workpiece accommodation means model and moves down the one workpiece model toward a bottom surface of the workpiece accommodation means model without changing the posture of the one workpiece model so that the one or plurality of workpiece models are automatically arranged; a virtual camera means for acquiring a virtual image of the workpiece models existing in a range of a designated visual field as viewed from a designated place in the virtual space; a correcting means for correcting teaching points of the robot program based on the virtual image acquired by the virtual camera means; and a simulation means for simulating a robot operation of handling the workpieces based on a program in which the teaching points are corrected by the correcting means. 2. The robot simulation apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a workpiece attribute information storage means for storing workpiece attribute information, wherein the workpiece model layout means calculates a distortion amount of the workpieces based on a workpiece attribute information stored in the workpiece attribute information storage means and the information of the contact portions of the plurality of the workpiece models, and arranges the workpiece models in the deformed state based on the distortion amount. 3. The robot simulation apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the workpiece attribute information include the stiffness, the weight and the center of gravity of the workpieces. 4. The robot simulation apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a robot motion storage means for monitoring and storing the actual motion of the robot, wherein the workpiece model layout means, based on the actual motion of the robot stored in the robot motion storage means, calculates the position and posture of the robot hand at the time of grasping each of the plurality of the workpieces and arranges the workpiece models based on the hand position and posture thus calculated.
