An orthopedic implant. The implant has a first portion including at least one patient-adjustable feature, and a second portion including at least one standard feature.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An orthopedic implant manufacturing method comprising: preparing a three-dimensional digital image of a patient's joint using computer modeling; creating a digital image of a non patient-specific femoral implant selected to closely match a size of the patient's joint, the implant having an inner bone engaging surface including a plurality of planar surfaces for engagement with corresponding standard size non-patient specific bone cuts; overlaying the digital image of the implant on the image of the patient's joint; modifying a shape of an anterior flange of the digital image of the femoral implant to be patient-matched and closely match a corresponding feature of the three-dimensional image of the patient's joint without modifying the planar surfaces of the inner bone engaging surface; and manufacturing a patient-matched implant from the digital image of the femoral implant as modified. 2. An orthopedic implant manufacturing method comprising: preparing a three-dimensional digital image of a patient's joint using computer modeling; creating a digital image of a non patient-specific femoral implant selected to closely match a size of the patient's joint, the implant having an inner bone engaging surface including a plurality of planar surfaces for engagement with corresponding standard size non-patient specific bone cuts; overlaying the digital image of the implant on the image of the patient's joint; modifying an orientation of a patella track of the digital image of the femoral implant to be patient-matched and closely match a corresponding feature of the three-dimensional image of the patient's joint without modifying the planar surfaces of the inner bone engaging surface; and manufacturing a patient-matched femoral implant from the digital image of the femoral implant as modified. 3. An orthopedic implant manufacturing method comprising: preparing a three-dimensional digital image of a patient's joint using computer modeling; creating a digital image of a non patient-specific femoral implant selected to closely match a size of the patient's joint, the femoral implant having an inner bone engaging surface including a plurality of planar surfaces for engagement with corresponding standard size non-patient specific bone cuts; overlaying the digital image of the implant on the image of the patient's joint; modifying a depth of a patella track of the digital image of the femoral implant to be patient-matched and closely match a corresponding feature of the three-dimensional image of the patient's joint without modifying the planar surfaces of the inner bone engaging surface; and manufacturing a patient-matched femoral implant from the digital image of the femoral implant as modified. 4. The method of claim 3, further comprising manufacturing a patient-specific alignment guide for the joint based on the three-dimensional image of the patient's joint.
