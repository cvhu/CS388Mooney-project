Methods and systems are provided for handling materials, including materials used in semiconductor manufacturing systems. The methods and systems include linear semiconductor processing facilities for vacuum-based semiconductor processing and handling, as well as linkable or extensible semiconductor processing facilities that can be flexibly configured to meet a variety of constraints.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system comprising: a front end module operating in an atmospheric environment; a first robotic handler operating in a vacuum environment; a load lock coupling the front end module to the first robotic handler, the load lock adapted to transfer a workpiece between the atmospheric environment and the vacuum environment; and a second robotic handler operating in the vacuum environment, the second robotic handler operable to exchange the workpiece with the first robotic handler using two or more vertically offset locations for handoff between the first robotic handler and the second robotic handler, the two or more vertically offset locations corresponding to workpiece transfer planes for transferring workpieces to respective process modules disposed in a plane of each of the two or more vertically offset locations. 2. A method comprising: retrieving a workpiece with a first robotic arm in a first horizontal plane; moving the workpiece to a second horizontal plane vertically offset from the first horizontal plane; and handing the workpiece off to a second robotic arm in the second horizontal plane, wherein the first and second horizontal planes correspond to workpiece transfer planes into and out of vertically stacked workpiece holding modules connected to the first and second robotic arms. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein handing the workpiece off includes placing the workpiece at a buffer station. 4. The method of claim 2 further comprising moving the workpiece to the first horizontal plane with the second robotic arm.
