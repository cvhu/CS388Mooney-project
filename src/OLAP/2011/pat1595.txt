A printhead assembly is provided having a plurality of print nozzle integrated circuits, an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the print nozzle integrated circuits, and drive electronics having electrical contacts for electrical connection to the electrical connector, input contacts for receiving print data, and a plurality of controllers for processing the print data. Each controller is connected to a predetermined number of the print nozzle integrated circuits via the electrical contacts and being interconnected to the other controllers. The drive electronics are selected from a range of drive electronics, each having a different number of the interconnected controllers configured to each process the print data applicable to a selected number of the print nozzle integrated circuits such that the ratio of controllers to print nozzle integrated circuits can be varied to change the print speed of the printhead assembly.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly comprising: a plurality of print nozzle integrated circuits; an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the print nozzle integrated circuits; and drive electronics having electrical contacts for electrical connection to the electrical connector, input contacts for receiving print data, and a plurality of controllers for processing the print data, each controller being connected to a predetermined number of the print nozzle integrated circuits via the electrical contacts and being interconnected to the other controllers, wherein the drive electronics are selected from a range of drive electronics, each having a different number of said interconnected controllers configured to each process the print data applicable to a selected number of the print nozzle integrated circuits such that the ratio of controllers to print nozzle integrated circuits can be varied to change the print speed of the printhead assembly. 2. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, further comprising a plurality of busbars arranged to distribute power to the print nozzle integrated circuits via the electrical connector. 3. A printhead assembly according to claim 2, wherein the power carried by the busbars is also delivered to the drive electronics via the electrical connector.
