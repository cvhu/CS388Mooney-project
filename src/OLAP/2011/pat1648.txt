A cable handling system mounted to a mobile robot to dispense and retrieve cable at zero tension includes a cable reel drive and a downstream tension roller drive that includes an idler. As a cable passes through the tension roller drive, position along the length of the cable and/or the cable speed is monitored accurately by a sensor attached to the idler. A system controller in communication with the sensor controls the cable reel drive and the tension roller drive for dispensing and retrieving cable downstream of the tension roller drive.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for controlling a cable handling system for a mobile robotic platform, the method comprising: providing at least one of an idle mode, a track mode, a track reverse mode, a track-in mode, and a track-out mode; providing an error mode, wherein the error mode comprises holding a cable reel and a cable roller motionless and sending an error signal when the slack in a cable between the cable reel and the cable roller exceeds a predetermined threshold; selecting at least one mode; and controlling the cable handling system in accordance therewith. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the idle mode comprises holding a cable reel and a cable roller motionless. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein the track mode comprises reeling out a cable when the mobile robotic platform moves forward. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the track reverse mode comprises reeling in a cable when the mobile robotic platform moves forward. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein the track-in mode comprises reeling in a cable. 6. The method of claim 1 wherein the track-out mode comprises reeling out a cable.
