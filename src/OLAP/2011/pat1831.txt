The invention relates to the clinically intelligent design of diagnostic devices (such as microarrays) and methods of making and using such devices in differential diagnoses of specific clinical symptoms or sets of symptoms. In one aspect, the devices include various probes used to perform parallel screening of a number of analytes. The probes are clustered on the devices based on known clinical presentations of symptoms associated with specific diseases and disorders.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of determining a susceptibility of a subject to a cause of one or more medical symptoms, the method comprising: (a) applying a biological sample from the subject to a multiplex test comprising a plurality of probes, wherein the plurality of probes comprise: (i) a first probe for a first target associated with a cause of one or more medical symptoms, and (ii) a second probe for a second target associated with a susceptibility of the subject to the cause of the one or more medical symptoms; (b) detecting interactions; and (c) analyzing the interactions to determine the susceptibility of the subject to the cause of the one or more medical symptoms. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein each target is a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, protein, antibody, antigen, small organic molecule, inorganic molecule, enzyme, polysaccharide, or a binding site for a causative agent for the one or more medical symptoms. 3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein all of the probes of the plurality selectively interact with each probe's respective target under the same conditions.
