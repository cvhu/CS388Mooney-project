A small tabletop stationary five-degree of freedom device such as a "robot" is used to define the treatment region by tracing the region under direct visualization and then to precisely deliver the treatment plan created by an automatic planning system by positioning a single low energy radiation source, or a plurality of low energy sources connected to each other in a predetermined parallel or similar geometry, each source equipped with blocking and attenuation mechanisms, at a plurality of positions in a planar fashion across or through a selected treatment field, thereby delivering a plurality of parallel overlapping beams indexed on a millimeter or submillimeter grid such that a concentration of dose is achieved at a variable depth in tissue relative to the dose where the radiation first enters the tissue and can be used to treat regions on or below the surface of tissue, in a cavity and underlying region created following a surgical resection, on or below the surface of an internal cavity, hollow viscus, or lumen, or deep in tissue adjacent to an inserted probe or conduit or catheter. By generating a plurality of overlapping beams indexed on a millimeter or submillimeter grid that converge on a target volume loaded with gold nanoparticles, a tumorcidal dose of radiation can be delivered in as little as a single session to tumor cells but not to normal cells within or outside the treatment volume. This approach also makes it possible to deliver serial radiosurgical treatments.
Claims We claim: 1. An apparatus for performing radiation therapy on a selected region of a tissue in proximity to said apparatus, said apparatus comprising: a scanning electron beam device that scans an electron beam over an at least one anode target in a predetermined pattern generating a plurality of diverging beams of radiation with an energy in a range from 20 to 600vKp; a means for disposing said plurality of diverging beams from a plurality of positions so as said plurality of diverging beams overlap in increasing amounts as said plurality of diverging beams pass through the tissue, whereby an amount of radiation delivered to the selected region of said tissue is equal to or greater than a dose delivered to said tissue through which said plurality of diverging beams travel to reach the selected region; and a means for creating a treatment plan wherein said treatment plan comprises at least said amount of radiation delivered to said region and a location of said region, wherein said treatment plan means at least in part communicate said treatment plan to the generating means, to the disposing means, or to both. 2. An apparatus for performing radiation therapy on a selected region of a tissue in proximity to said apparatus, said apparatus comprising: a scanning electron beam device that scans an electron beam over an at least one anode target in a predetermined pattern generating a plurality of diverging beams of radiation with an energy in the range from 20 to 600vKp; a means for disposing said plurality of diverging beams from a plurality of positions so as said plurality of diverging beams overlap in increasing amounts as said plurality of diverging beams pass through the tissue, whereby an amount of radiation delivered to the selected region of said tissue is equal to or greater than a dose delivered to said tissue through which said plurality of diverging beams travel to reach the selected region; and a means for detecting movement of the selected region during said therapy and a means for modifying said therapy based on the detected movement. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 wherein the detecting means comprises a tracking system for tracking position of markers placed on a tissue surface to mark the selected region. 4. A method for delivering a dose of radiation to a region of tissue in a patient, comprising the steps of: scanning an electron beam over an at least one anode target in a predetermined pattern; generating diverging beams with energy in a range from 20 to 600 kVp; disposing said diverging beams from a plurality of positions so as said diverging beams overlap in increasing amounts as said diverging beams pass through the tissue; identifying said region directly on said patient with a localization system, transferring data from said localization system into a treatment planning system, entering into said treatment planning system a dose of radiation to be delivered to at least one area of said region a position of said areas of said region, generating a treatment plan for said region comprising said position of said area of said region and said dose to be delivered at said area of said region.
