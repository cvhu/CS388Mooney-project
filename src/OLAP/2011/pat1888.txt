A method of transferring disk drives within a disk drive testing system includes actuating an automated transporter to retrieve multiple disk drives presented for testing, and actuating the automated transporter to deliver each retrieved disk drive to a respective test slot of the disk drive testing system and insert each disk drive in the respective test slot.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of transferring disk drives within a disk drive testing system, the method comprising: actuating an automated transporter to retrieve multiple disk drive transporters; actuating the automated transporter to retrieve multiple disk drives presented for testing by carrying each of the disk drives with respective disk drive transporters; and actuating the automated transporter to deliver each of the disk drive transporters, each carrying one of the disk drives, to a respective test slot of the disk drive testing system and to insert each transporter, carrying a disk drive, in the respective test slots. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the disk drive transporters is inserted into a respective test slot, engaging the carried disk drive with a respective connector of the disk drive testing system, the inserted disk drive transporters providing closure of their respective test slots. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the disk drives are present in at least one disk drive tote presented to the disk drive testing system. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the automated transporter retrieves each of the disk drives from the at least one disk drive tote with the corresponding disk drive transporter by positioning the disk drive transporter below the disk drive, lifting the disk drive off a disk drive support of the disk drive tote, and carrying the disk drive in the disk drive transporter away from the disk drive tote. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the automated transporter comprises a manipulator configured to transport multiple disk drives.
