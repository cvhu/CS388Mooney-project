A cutoff saw assembly incorporates a robot assembly with a compliant cutting apparatus to remove various undesired metal extensions from a casting. The assembly cooperatively and conjunctively controls the position of the casting using the robot assembly and the force exerted by the cutting apparatus on the casting using a compliance control system. The compliance control system includes a compliance actuator that is connected to a compliance regulator. Both the robot assembly and the compliance control system are connected to a system controller. The compliance actuator is connected to the cutoff blade to actively vary the force of the cutting blade with respect to the casting. The compliance regulator, which is connected to the system controller, will measure and regulate the pressure in the compliance actuator, such that the robot assembly and compliance control system can apply the required force to cut the casting.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for cutting off excess material from a casting comprising the steps of: a) programming a system controller to cooperatively manage a robot arm and a compliance control system controlling a cutting force of a cutoff blade for removing the excess material from the casting; b) engaging the casting with said robot arm; c) transporting the casting to a position proximate a cutoff blade using said robot arm; d) urging the casting into engagement with said cutoff blade using said robot arm; e) controlling the cutting force of the casting engaging said cutoff blade with said compliance control system, said compliance control system controlling the cutting force by allowing said cutoff blade to move with the casting and by moving said cutoff blade toward the casting to maintain the constant cutting force between the casting and said cutoff blade; the step of controlling the cutting force comprising: positioning an actuator between said cutoff blade and a frame; connecting said actuator to a compliance regulator; connecting said compliance regulator that measures and controls pressure in said actuator to said system controller, said system controller providing a preset pressure setpoint in said compliance regulator; and controlling the pressure in said actuator with said compliance regulator to bias said cutoff blade as said casting comes into contact with said cutoff blade. 2. The method as described in claim 1 further comprising the step: controlling a drive system corresponding to the desired speed of rotation of said cutoff blade to engage the casting. 3. The method as described in claim 1, further comprising the step of: controlling the necessary cutoff speed of said cutoff blade using said system controller. 4. The method as described in claim 2 further comprising the step of: maintaining a constant surface feet per minute of said cutoff blade with said drive system as said cutoff blade reduces in size. 5. A method for cutting off excess material from a casting comprising the steps of: a) programming a system controller to cooperatively manage a robot arm and a compliance control system controlling a cutting force of a cutoff blade for removing the excess material from the casting; b) engaging the casting with the robot arm; c) transporting the casting to a position proximate a cutoff blade using said robot arm; d) urging the casting into engagement with said cutoff blade with said robot arm; e) controlling the cutting force of the casting engaging said cutoff blade with said compliance control system biasing said cutoff blade with respect to the casting to maintain the constant cutting force between the casting and said cutoff blade, the step of controlling the cutting force further comprising: positioning an actuator between said cutoff blade and a frame; connecting said actuator to a compliance regulator; connecting said compliance regulator that measures and regulates pressure in said actuator to said system controller, said system controller providing a preset pressure setpoint in said compliance regulator; and controlling the pressure in said actuator with said compliance regulator to bias said cutoff blade as said casting comes into contact with said cutoff blade. 6. A method for cutting off excess material from a casting comprising the steps of: a) programming a system controller to cooperatively manage a robot arm and a compliance control system controlling a cutting force of a cutoff blade for removing the excess material from the casting; b) engaging the casting with said robot arm; c) transporting the casting by said robot arm to a position proximate a cutoff blade supported by a beam, said beam engaged by an actuator that is controlled by a compliance regulator that measures and regulates pressure in said actuator, said compliance regulator further connected to a system controller; d) directing the casting into engagement with said cutoff blade using said robot arm; e) controlling the cutting force of the casting engaging said cutoff blade with said compliance control system biasing said cutoff blade with respect to the casting to maintain the constant cutting force between the casting and said cutoff blade, the step of controlling the cutting force further comprising: connecting said compliance regulator that measures and regulates pressure in said actuator to said system controller, said system controller providing a preset pressure setpoint in said compliance regulator; and controlling the pressure in said actuator with said compliance regulator to bias said cutoff blade as said casting comes into contact with said cutoff blade. 7. A method for cutting off excess material from a casting comprising the steps of: a) programming a system controller to cooperatively manage a robot arm and a compliance system controlling a cutting force of a cutoff blade for removing the excess material from the casting; b) engaging the casting with said robot arm; c) transporting the casting with said robot arm to a position proximate a cutoff blade engaged by said compliance control system, said compliance control system including an actuator that is controlled by a compliance regulator connected to a system controller, said compliance regulator measuring and regulating pressure in said actuator and said system controller providing a present pressure setpoint in said compliance regulator; d) urging the casting into engagement with said cutoff blade with said robot arm; e) controlling the cutting force of the casting engaging said cutoff blade with said compliance control system biasing the cutoff blade with respect to the casting so the cutting force is maintained at a constant between the casting and said cutoff blade by controlling the pressure in said actuator with said compliance regulator to bias said cutoff blade as said casting comes into contact with said cutoff blade.
