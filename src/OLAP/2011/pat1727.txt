A hemming apparatus is provided for use with a robot in performing a hemming operation. The hemming apparatus comprises a support housing which mounts to a machine and has a pressurizable interior chamber having forward and rearward portions. A slide member includes a piston which is disposed in the chamber, and a plunger extends outwardly from the piston. Means are provided for attaching the housing to a nose having a central passageway. A bearing shaft is disposed within the central passageway, and means are provided for connecting the bearing shaft to the plunger. A hem roller is attached at the end of the bearing shaft. The rearward and forward portions of the chamber are connectible to a source of fluid pressure such that adjusting the chamber pressures moves the piston, thereby causing the bearing shaft to drive the hem roller into engagement with a work piece.

A roller-type hemming apparatus, comprising: a support member having a slide bore and an interior chamber; a closure plate having a guide bore therethrough, said closure plate having a pair of opposed faces, said closure plate being mounted along a first of said opposed faces in sealing relation to said support member allowing said interior chamber to be pressurized; a slide member including a piston and an axially elongated plunger extending therefrom and terminating in a connectible end, said piston mounted in said interior chamber for axial slidable movement relative to said bore, and said plunger extending through said guide bore for axial slidable movement relative thereto, said plunger and said guide bore being fitted to form a close interface, said piston separating said interior chamber into forward and rearward chamber portions with each said chamber portion being adapted to be placed in fluid communication with a pressure source for selectively adjusting the pressurize in each of said chamber portions and the force applied against opposite sides of said piston wherein to move said piston and said connectible end of said plunger relative to said closure plate; means for sealing said interface between said plunger and said guide bore; a roller hemming assembly, said roller hemming assembly including at least one hem roller for engaging a workpiece; and means for connecting said roller hemming assembly to said plunger; wherein adjusting the pressure in said respective chamber portions causes said plunger to force said hem roller into engagement with said workpiece. 8. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein said plunger further comprises a two-part assembly comprised of a piston shaft and a quick-connect shaft, said assembly is coaxially disposed and extends outwardly from said forward side of said piston, said piston shaft and said quick-connect shaft being threadably connected to each other at their respective ends, said piston shaft including a rearward end connected to said piston, and said connectible end is formed by a forward end portion of said quick-connect shaft. 9. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein said spindle cartridge has a spindle shaft with opposite ends, said spindle shaft being rotatably mounted to said spindle cartridge, and at least one hem roller is rotatably secured to said spindle shaft. 10. The apparatus of claim 9 wherein said spindle shaft has opposed ends, each end having at least one of said hem rollers secured thereto, said hem rollers being different in diameter from each other. 11. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein said means for connecting said roller hemming assembly to said plunger further comprises an axial bearing shaft having forward and rearward end portions, said forward end portion including means for removably mounting said roller hemming assembly; and said rearward end portion of said bearing shaft and said connectible end of said plunger having complementary male and female portions which are adapted to interlock with one another wherein to connect said bearing shaft and said plunger together. 12.
