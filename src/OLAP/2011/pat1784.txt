Method, system and an article of manufacture for clustering and thereby identifying predefined antigens reactive with undetermined immunoglobulins of sera derived from patient subjects in need of diagnosis of disease or monitoring of treatment.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of diagnosing Type I diabetes in a subject, the method comprising: (a) determining an antibody pattern in a serum sample of said patient by assaying said serum sample for the presence of antibodies binding to antigens of a Type I diabetes disease classifier, said disease classifier comprising antigens of cluster 5 comprising Insulin and Aldolase, cluster 14 comprising Cartilage extract, cluster 26 comprising Histone II A, Lysine, Arginine, Laminin, Collagen X, Fibrinogen and Collagen VII, cluster 47 comprising Collagen X and Insulin and cluster 66 comprising Cardiolipin and Cartilage extract, (b) comparing said antibody pattern to said classifier, wherein an antibody pattern including the presence of antibodies binding the antigens of said classifier indicates a diagnosis of Type I diabetes in the subject. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining said antibody pattern is effected by ELISA. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said antibodies comprise IgG and/or IgM. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said Type I diabetes disease classifier consists of antigens of cluster 5 comprising Insulin and Aldolase, cluster 14 comprising Cartilage extract, cluster 26 comprising Histone II A, Lysine, Arginine, Laminin, Collagen X, Fibrinogen and Collagen VII, cluster 47 comprising Collagen X and Insulin and cluster 66 comprising Cardiolipin and Cartilage.
