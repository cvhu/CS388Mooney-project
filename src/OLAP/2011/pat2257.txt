The present invention relates to a record media written with a data structure used in recognizing specific users in hardware such as a robot, etc., a method for recognizing a user by using a data structure written in the record media, and a user identification database access method for the user identification software component application programming interface (API) and an error handling method in the user identification software component API. Among the user identification elements, in particular, the present invention relates to a method for building a database of image data for the user's clothes, and a performance evaluation of a vision-based recognizer, which is means for recognizing the user's image information for the clothes.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A user identification method, comprising: enrolling to configure and store user identification data templates by capturing specific user identification data as a sample; measuring and collecting the user identification data; verifying to match the collected user identification data with the stored user identification data templates; and identifying to judge user identification result by the matched results, wherein the user identification data in the enrolling and verifying steps are configured by a data structure written in a record media written for recognizing a user, the record media being written with the user identification data used in a user identification software component application (API) programming interface, the record media including, a header region storing information on a length, a kind, and a format of the user identification data, and a data region storing the user identification data wherein the header region includes a field storing the information on the length of the user identification data, a field storing the information on the format of the user identification data, a field storing information on a processing speed of the user identification data, a field storing information on whether the user identification data is encrypted, and a field storing information on an user identification element corresponding to the user identification data.
