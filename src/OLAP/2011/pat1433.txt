The present invention is a device having a rigidly linked jaw that is decoupled from an articulating wrist. The device provides for articulating motion as well as actuation that may be used in grasping, cutting, suturing or the like.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An articulating device for .[.tissue and needle manipulation.]. .Iadd.medical intervention and surgery.Iaddend., the device comprising: .[.an elongated.]. .Iadd.a .Iaddend.housing having a proximal end and a distal end; an articulation rod .[.extending interior the housing, the articulation rod.]. having a proximal end and a distal end; an actuation rod .[.extending interior the housing, the actuation rod.]. having a proximal end .[.and.]..Iadd., .Iaddend.a distal end.Iadd., and a longitudinal axis.Iaddend.; .Iadd.a cylindrical rack adjacent the distal end of the housing;.Iaddend. a rack driver .Iadd.adjacent the distal end of the housing, the rack driver .Iaddend.in communication with .Iadd.the distal end of .Iaddend.the actuation rod .[.at the distal end thereof.]., the rack driver engaged with .[.a.]. .Iadd.the .Iaddend.cylindrical rack .[.for translating the motion of the actuation rod substantially about ninety degrees.]. .Iadd.to move the cylindrical rack orthogonally to the longitudinal axis.Iaddend.; and a jaw .Iadd.adjacent the distal end of the housing, the jaw .Iaddend.in communication with the cylindrical rack, .[.whereby movement of the cylindrical rack.]. .Iadd.the cylindrical rack being orthogonally movable relative to the longitudinal axis to .Iaddend.actuate.[.s.]. the jaw, the jaw further in pivotal communication with .Iadd.the distal end of .Iaddend.the articulation rod such that linear movement of the articulation rod produces rotational movement of the jaw.Iadd.; the actuation rod coupled to a pin, the pin confined to a rack channel on the rack driver.Iaddend..
