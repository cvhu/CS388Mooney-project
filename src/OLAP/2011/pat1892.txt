A printer is provided having a pagewidth printhead and a casing having a channel in which the pagewidth printhead is removably clamped so as to constrain movement of the printhead relative to the casing across the longitudinal direction of the channel and to allow movement of the printhead along the longitudinal direction of the channel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printer comprising: a modular pagewidth printhead; and a casing having a channel in which modules of the modular pagewidth printhead are removably clamped so as to constrain movement of the modules of the printhead relative to the casing across the longitudinal direction of the channel and to allow movement of the modules of the printhead along the longitudinal direction of the channel. 2. A printer according to claim 1, wherein: the channel comprises first and second side walls joined by a lower wall; the first side wall includes a longitudinally extending groove formed between upper and lower longitudinally extending tabs into which a first side of each module of the printhead is slidably received; and the second side wall has a longitudinally extending upper surface upon which a second side of each module of the printhead is clamped, the longitudinally extending upper surface having a height from the lower surface of the channel substantially equal to a height of the lower longitudinally extending tab of the first side wall.
