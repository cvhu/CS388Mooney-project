Use of calibrant in extraction phase is described for quantification of components of interest in samples in laboratory application as well as in on-site monitoring. This approach is particularly useful for in-vivo investigation of living systems.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A device for continuous extraction and analysis of a component in a sample constituting a feeding fluid, said device comprising a semipermeable membrane in a housing, said feeding fluid passing on one side of said semipermeable membrane and a stripping fluid simultaneously passing on the other side of said semipermeable membrane, said stripping fluid containing an inert calibrant, said stripping fluid constituting a carrier to deliver to an analytical device said inert calibrant remaining in said stripping fluid and said component passing from said feeding fluid through said semipermeable structure into said stripping fluid. 2. The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said stripping fluid is a gas and analytical instrument is a gas chromatograph.
