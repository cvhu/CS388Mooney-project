Methods and systems for simulating the natural tempo of humans are provided. The method utilizes multiples of a basic unit of duration, or quantum unit, of human timing. Unconscious, but precise, compensations occur through imperceptible changes in the timing quantum level. An application of natural human tempo to improve the basic metronome function by humanizing it is also provided. Other ramifications of human tempo simulation are also discussed, including robots and computer games and graphics.
