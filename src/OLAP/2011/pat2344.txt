There is provided a diagnostic tool for use in diagnosing diseases, the tool having a detector for detecting the presence of an array of markers indicative of disease. Also provided is a combination of markers for disease, the combination including at least two markers of the disease. A method of choosing such combinations of markers for a given disease as well as a method for detecting a combination of markers for diagnosing the presence of a disease state or determining a disease stage is also provided. The method includes selectively biopanning sera obtained from a patient to obtain cDNA clones to array for analysis and determining if the markers are present among the cDNA clones present in the disease. Epitopes found using this method are also provided as well as a database incorporating these epitopes. A biochip for detecting the presence of a disease marker in a patient's sera is provided, wherein the biochip has a detector contained within the biochip for detecting disease markers in a patient's sera.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of detecting informative markers of early stage cancer by: differentially biopanning sera obtained from normal individuals and patients with early stage cancer against epitope-expressing phage display libraries; obtaining epitope bearing clones displaying reactivity to antibodies present in sera of patients with early stage cancer but not in sera of normal individuals, including the step of identifying and excluding the sera of normal individuals that react strongly but nonspecifically to epitope bearing clones, wherein the step of excluding the sera of normal individuals which react strongly but nonspecifically to epitope bearing clones further includes the step of excluding sera which show a unimodal pattern of dual fluorescence reaction with epitope bearing clones, where a first color indicates reaction with human immunoglobulin and a second color indicates reaction to phage capsid proteins; identifying all epitopes that are specific to patients with early stage cancer as informative markers of early stage cancer; and including all epitopes identified as informative markers in a microarray assay designed to detect early stage cancer.
