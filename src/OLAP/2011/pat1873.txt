The present invention is a system comprising surgical units and operator interface units configured to provide multiple capabilities within a surgical environment, or within a surgical training environment. The system may provide such capabilities in a modular fashion, such that various functions may be accomplished through the addition or deletion of modules to the system to allow core components to be used to accomplish more than one function.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An augmented surgical appliance comprising: a plurality of surgical units, said surgical units each comprising at least one effector for applying a surgical tool to a patient's tissue; at least one controller unit; and an interface unit, said interface unit having a plurality of hand controllers for receiving positioning inputs from an operator, said interface unit further providing force feedback signals to an operator of said interface unit, wherein said plurality of surgical units are communicably connected to said controller; wherein said interface unit is communicably connected to said controller; and wherein said controller comprises software for transforming input received from said interface unit into control signals communicable to said surgical units, and wherein said software further comprises functionality to allow an operator to associate desired effectors with desired hand controllers and receive an indication from said operator that an effector and/or instrument associated with a surgical unit should be moved to a retracted position when the effector and/or instrument is no longer associated with a hand controller. 2. A method for utilizing an augmented surgical appliance having more effectors than hand controllers, comprising the steps of: providing an interface unit, said interface unit having at least one hand controller, said hand controller receiving positioning commands from an operator of said interface unit and providing force and positioning feedback to said operator; providing at least one surgical unit, said at least one surgical unit having a plurality of effectors, said plurality of effectors having at least one more effector than hand controllers; providing a controller unit for receiving positioning commands from said interface unit and for generating control signals for said plurality of effectors, said controller unit further generating control signals for said interface unit for providing force and positioning feedback; communicably connecting said interface unit to said controller; communicably connecting said surgical unit to said controller; transferring control of said surgical unit to said interface unit; receiving from an operator of said interface unit information identifying desired associations between said at least one hand control and said effectors, said association identifying a single effector to be associated with a given hand controller; initiating a surgical procedure utilizing said surgical unit; receiving from said operator a new desired association between said at least one hand control and said effectors, said association identifying a single effector to be associated with a given hand controller, and further comprising the step of determining from said operator whether said operator desires to have a deselected effector move to a retracted position; and continuing said surgical procedure. 3. A computer readable media, which when executed by a computer implements a process providing control functionality to an augmented surgical appliance, said surgical appliance having an interface unit, said interface unit having at least one hand controller, said hand controller receiving positioning commands from an operator of said interface unit and providing force and positioning feedback to said operator, said surgical appliance further having a surgical unit, said first surgical unit having a plurality of effectors, said plurality of effectors having at least one more effector than hand controllers, said surgical appliance further having a controller unit for receiving positioning commands from said interface unit and for generating control signals for said plurality of effectors, said controller unit further generating control signals for said interface unit for providing force and positioning feedback, said process comprising the steps of: transferring control of a surgical unit to an interface unit; receiving from an operator of said interface unit information identifying desired associations between said at least one hand control and said effectors, said association identifying a single effector to be associated with a given hand controller, and further comprising the step of determining from said operator whether said operator desires to have a deselected effector move to a retracted position; initiating a surgical procedure utilizing said surgical unit; and receiving from said operator a new desired association between said at least one hand control and said effectors, said association identifying a single effector to be associated with a given hand controller.
