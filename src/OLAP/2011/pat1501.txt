Techniques for managing data distributed over nodes in a network include receiving, at an original node, content data that describes a physical entity that is not a router in a vicinity of the original node. In response to receiving the content, a beacon data object is generated in an object-oriented database distributed over the network nodes. The beacon holds the content data and holds policy data that indicates how to terminate the beacon. A node that has ownership of the beacon performs the step of terminating the beacon based on the policy data. Ownership of the beacon can be transferred so that the beacon stays associated with the physical entity, such as a room in a building, even as a mobile original node moves away from the physical entity. The content data can indicate conditions that invite responsive action, such as hazardous environmental conditions.
