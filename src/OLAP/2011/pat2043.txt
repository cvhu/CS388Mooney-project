A combinatorial method for identifying a catalyst composition for use in the homogeneous addition polymerization of an olefin monomers, said catalyst composition comprising a transition metal compound, a cocatalyst and a polymerization modifier, as well as catalyst compositions and improved olefin polymerization processes resulting therefrom.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A composition comprising a polymerization modifier for the copolymerization of at least one olefin monomer and styrene, wherein the modifier is selected from the group consisting of bis(N,N-diphenylamide)ethyl aluminum and N,N-diphenylamidobis(2,7-dimethyl-6-octene-1-yl)aluminum. 2. The composition of claim 1 further comprising a transition metal complex and a cocatalyst. 3. The composition of claim 2 wherein the metal complex is a Group 4 metal complex and the cocatalyst is a Lewis acid or a trihydrocarbylammonium salt of a noncoordinating compatible anion. 4. The composition of claim 3 wherein the metal complex comprises (1H-cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene-2-yl)dimethyl(t-butylamido)silanetitanium dimethyl; and, the cocatalyst comprises tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron or a trialkylammonium salt of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. 5. A polymerization process comprising contacting at least one olefin monomer and styrene under polymerization conditions with the composition of claim 2. 6. The polymerization process of claim 5 wherein the metal complex is a Group 4 metal complex and the cocatalyst is a Lewis acid or a trihydrocarbylammonium salt of a noncoordinating compatible anion. 7. The polymerization process of claim 5 wherein the metal complex comprises (1H-cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene-2-yl)dimethyl(t-butylamido)silane- titanium dimethyl; and, the cocatalyst comprises tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron or a trialkylammonium salt of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate.
