A method of preventing or delaying the onset of an increase in blood glucose levels in a human comprising administering to said human a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of an antisense compound 12 to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least one of a modified internucleoside linkage, a high affinity modified sugar or a modified nucleobase, wherein the compound is targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human glucagon receptor and wherein the compound specifically hybridizes with at least 90% complementarity within nucleotides 442 to 490, 493 to 521, 588 to 646, or 751 to 788 of a nucleic acid molecule having the sequence SEQ ID NO:4 and inhibits the expression of the human glucagon receptor. 11. The method of claim 10 wherein the human suffers from diabetes, obesity or insulin resistance. 12. The method of claim 10 wherein the blood glucose levels are plasma glucose levels. 13. The method of claim 1, wherein the compound is at least 95% complementary to SEQ ID NO: 4. 14. The method of claim 1, wherein the compound is 15 to 30 nucleobases in length. 15. The method of claim 1, wherein the compound is 20 nucleobases in length. 16. The method of claim 1, wherein the compound comprises an oligonucleotide. 17. The method of claim 16, wherein the oligonucleotide is chimeric. 18. The method of claim 1, wherein the compound comprises at least one chemical modification. 19.
