A robotic welding cell includes a frame, a robot arm connected to the frame, a welding gun affixed to the robot arm, a welding table connected to the welding frame, and means to move the welding table in or about at least two mutually perpendicular axes. A welding table assembly for use in a robot welding cell is also disclosed.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A welding table assembly for use in a robot welding cell, the assembly comprising: a welding table; a first powered drive assembly operatively connected to the welding table, wherein the first drive assembly rotates the welding table about a first axis; said first powered drive assembly being supported on a first support, said first support defining a first opening for receiving an output shaft of said first powered drive assembly, said first support being rotatable about a third axis perpendicular to said first axis; a second powered drive assembly including an output shaft operatively connected to the welding table, wherein the second powered drive assembly rotates the welding table about a second axis that is perpendicular to the first axis; a second support extending from a base, said base being operatively connected to said first powered drive assembly, said second support extending in a plane parallel to and spaced from said first axis, wherein said second support and said base rotate about the first axis, said second support defining a second opening; wherein the second powered drive assembly is supported beneath the second support with said output shaft of the second powered drive assembly extending through the second opening in the second support such that the output shaft of the second powered drive assembly and the welding table freely rotate with respect to the second support. 2. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the second powered drive assembly is configured to prevent a complete revolution of the welding table about the first axis. 3. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the first powered drive assembly is configured to allow a complete revolution of the welding table about the second axis.
