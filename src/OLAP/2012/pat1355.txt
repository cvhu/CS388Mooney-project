Tactile sensor. The sensor includes a compliant convex surface disposed above a sensor array, the sensor array adapted to respond to deformation of the convex surface to generate a signal related to an applied force vector.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Tactile sensor comprising: a compliant convex surface defining a dome with a hollow interior and having a linear relation between displacement of the convex surface and an applied force thereon; and an array disposed within the dome including a light emitter and a plurality of light sensors that respond to light intensity from the emitter, the array responding to deformation of the convex surface to generate a signal related to the applied force thereon. 2. The sensor of claim 1 wherein the array includes four phototransistors. 3. The sensor of claim 2 wherein the four phototransistors surround the light emitter.
