A method for producing human-like glycoproteins by expressing a Class 2 .alpha.-mannosidase having a substrate specificity for Man.alpha.1,3 and Man.alpha.1,6 glycosidic linkages in a lower eukaryote is disclosed. Hydrolysis of these linkages on oligosaccharides produces substrates for further N-glycan processing in the secretory pathway.
