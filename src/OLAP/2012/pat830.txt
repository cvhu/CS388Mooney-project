Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of controlling access to an automated media library, the method comprising: receiving a request for access to said library from an individual having an identity, said request for access including an input specifying a type of operation requested by said access; determining a type of access based on the operation requested from among import of media to said library, export of media from said library, and opening a locked door to a cabinet containing said library; a controller loading a systems authentication policy which provides access authority and authentication levels for various registered users of the library; authenticating the identity of said individual; the controller determining an access level associated with said individual; if said access level is insufficient for said requested access, denying said requested access and issuing an alert; if said access level is sufficient for said requested access, determining if said requested access requires a second authentication; if a second authentication is required, prompting said individual to perform said second authentication; if said second authentication is verified, logging said access by said individual and granting said access; if said operation includes opening said door, taking a first inventory of the media in said library; if said access is granted, unlocking said door; starting a timer when the door is unlocked; locking said door a predetermined length of time, based on the timer, after unlocking said door; taking a second inventory of said media after locking the door; comparing the second inventory with the first inventory; and issuing an alert if said second inventory differs from said first inventory.
