A front-loading, refuse collecting vehicle is modularly provided with a combination of a low-profile, front-loadable waste bin (intermediate container) and one or more, side-loading robotic arms. To reduce mechanical stresses along couplings between the vehicle and the combination of the intermediate container and the robotic arm(s), a major portion of the mass of the robotic arm mechanism is situated to the rear of the intermediate container so that a mass and beam combination is defined where the mass-supporting beam has reduced length. More specifically, hydraulic and/or other relatively massive motor devices of the robotic arm mechanism are mounted to the rear of a refuse-containing wall of the intermediate container. Elastomeric and/or other dampening devices may be interposed between the vehicle and the bulk mass of the combination of the intermediate container and robotic arm mechanism for converting into heat some of the vibrational energy which may otherwise move between the vehicle and the combination of the intermediate container and robotic arm mechanism. A modular sled system may be provided for supporting different robotic arms in combination with refuse containers made of different materials as may be appropriate for different waste collection situations.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mechanically-liftable and modularly-assembled combination of a refuse container and a side-loading, first robotic arm mechanism for use with a front-loading, waste collecting vehicle, where the refuse container has a rear and a front, and the container defines a total refuse containment volume for containing a corresponding total volume of refuse transferrable thereto by the side-loading first robotic arm mechanism, where the vehicle has a frontwardly facing engagement means for disengageably engaging with and mechanically lifting the modularly-assembled combination of the refuse container and the first robotic arm mechanism, the engagement means including at least one of a fork means and a fork-free means for disengageably engaging with and mechanically lifting the combination, and where said modularly-assembled combination is characterized by: the side-loading first robotic arm mechanism being provided as part of a first module that is modularly-assemblable into the combination such that, when the first module is assembled into said combination, the first robotic arm mechanism can have a major portion of its mass positioned rearward of a position where a rearmost portion of said total refuse containment volume is positioned or will be positioned upon completion of assembly of the modularly-assembled combination; the side-loading first robotic arm mechanism having a retractable side arm for retractably reaching out to grasp a waste container or waste and for translating the grasped waste container or waste for disposal of its corresponding waste into said total refuse containment volume; the modularly-assembled combination having lift-receiving means for operatively receiving the frontwardly facing engagement means of a provided, front-loading vehicle; and the modularly-assembled combination being provided with clearance means or being adapted to engageably cooperate with provided clearance means where said clearance means functions to keep the major mass portion of the first robotic arm mechanism clear of collision with one or more parts of the provided, front-loading vehicle during at least one of a first operation where the mechanically-liftable and modularly-assembled combination is mechanically lifted for dumping of its refuse contents into a rearward hopper portion of the waste collecting vehicle and a second operation where the retractable side arm of the first robotic arm mechanism is reaching out to grasp the waste container or waste. 2.

A modularly-assembleable combination of waste-collecting structures configured for modular assembly and for operative use with a pre-specified and to-be-provided front-loading, waste collecting vehicle, where the vehicle has a frontwardly facing engagement means for disengageably engaging with and mechanically lifting a counterpart, engageable refuse containment apparatus; said modularly-assembleable combination of waste-collecting structures being assembleable to form at least part of said refuse containment apparatus and comprising: at least a first robotic arm mechanism having a major-mass portion and a minor-mass portion coupled to the major-mass portion, where the minor-mass portion includes at least a first waste grasper operative to selectively grasp waste or a waste container and to subsequently selectively release the grasped waste or waste container; at least a first front-loadable intermediate container having a rear and a front and defining a total refuse containment volume for containing a corresponding total volume of refuse transferrable thereto by the waste grasper of the first robotic arm mechanism after the modularly-assembleable combination is assembled and energized; a rearward-mounting enabling means for enabling the major-mass portion of the first robotic arm mechanism to be operable while being detachably mounted rearward of the total refuse containment volume defined by the first intermediate container such that the at least a first waste grasper of the first robotic arm mechanism can unobstructedly carry out reach-out and item-capturing operations for waste or for waste containers and retract and waste-dumping operations while the major-mass portion is in the rearward-mounted position interposed between the waste collecting vehicle and the total refuse containment volume defined by the first intermediate container. 11.
