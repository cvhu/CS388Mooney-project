Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inhibiting the activity of a microRNA comprising contacting a cell comprising the microRNA with a compound comprising an oligomeric compound, wherein: the oligomeric compound is at least 90% complementary to a miRNA or a precursor thereof; the oligomeric compound consists of 15 to 30 linked monomeric subunits; at least one monomeric subunit is a modified nucleoside; and the miRNA is selected from miR-21 (SEQ ID NO: 64) and miR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 29). 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the miRNA is miR-21 (SEQ ID NO: 64). 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the miRNA is miR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 29). 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound is at least 95% complementary to the miRNA. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound is 100% complementary to the miRNA. 6. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound is 100% complementary to at least an 8-nucleobase portion of the miRNA. 7. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound consists of 19 to 23 linked monomeric subunits. 8. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound consists of an oligonucleotide. 9. The method of claim 8 wherein the oligonucleotide consists of 19 to 23 linked nucleosides. 10. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 11. The method of claim 10 wherein the modified sugar moiety is selected from 2'-F, 2'-O-methyl, 2'-O-methoxyethyl, and a bicyclic sugar moiety. 12. The method of claim 11 wherein the bicyclic sugar moiety comprises a 4'-CH.sub.2--O-2' bridge. 13. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 14. The method of claim 13 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 15. The method of claim 1 wherein each internucleoside linkage of the oligomeric compound is a phosphorothioate linkage. 16. The method of claim 1 wherein each monomeric subunit comprises a modified sugar moiety. 17. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligonucleotide comprises two or more chemically distinct regions. 18. The method of claim 17 wherein each nucleoside of the two or more chemically distinct regions is independently selected from a 2'-fluoro nucleoside, a 2'-O-methyl nucleoside, a 2'-O-methoxyethyl nucleoside, a 2'-deoxynucleoside, and a bicyclic sugar nucleoside. 19. The method of claim 17 wherein each nucleoside of the two or more chemically distinct regions is independently selected from a 2'-deoxynucleoside and a bicyclic sugar nucleoside. 20. The method of claim 19 wherein the bicyclic nucleoside comprises a 4'-CH.sub.2--O-2' bridge. 21. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 22. The method of claim 21 wherein the modified nucleobase is 5-methylcytosine. 23. The method of claim 1 wherein the oligomeric compound is attached to a conjugate group. 24. The method of claim 23 wherein the conjugate group is cholesterol. 25. A composition comprising a compound comprising an oligomeric compound, wherein: the oligomeric compound is at least 90% complementary to a miRNA or a precursor thereof; the oligomeric compound consists of 15 to 30 linked monomeric subunits; at least one monomeric subunit is a modified nucleoside; and the miRNA is selected from miR-21 (SEQ ID NO: 64) and miR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 29); and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.
