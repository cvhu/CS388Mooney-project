The present invention provides a will-expression modeling device simulating human will-expression responding to an direction input given from the outside, which includes an interest interpretation section, an emotion creating section and a will-expression section. The interest interpretation section collates the direction input with a predetermined hedonic interest relationship table and outputs a mood factor representing pleasure, displeasure or the like. The emotion creating section prepares a plurality of emotional states obtained by modeling human emotions as data and causes state transitions to occur in the emotional states according to the mood factor to simulate a change in human emotion responding to the direction input. The will-expression section prepares in advance a plurality of mental-will states obtained by modeling human will as data and selects a new mental-will state from the emotional states or a "combination of a mental-will state and an emotional state".
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A will-expression modeling device simulating human will-expression responding to an direction input given from the outside, comprising: a computer; an interest interpretation section, implemented on the computer, that collates said direction input with a predetermined hedonic interest relationship table and outputs a mood factor representing pleasure/displeasure; an emotion creating section, implemented on the computer, that prepares a plurality of emotional states obtained by modeling human emotions and causes state transitions to occur in the emotional states according to said mood factor to simulate a change in human emotion responding to said direction input; and a will-expression section, implemented on the computer, that prepares in advance a plurality of mental-will states obtained by modeling human will and selects a new mental-will state from said emotional states or a combination of a mental-will state and an emotional state, wherein when receiving an instruction input of encouragement or suppression based on a relationship between said direction input and said mental-will states being selected from an outside instructor, said interpretation section redefines said hedonic interest relationship table in response to said instruction input to make said will-expression closer to human common sense and super-ego. 2. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 1, wherein said emotion creating section includes: an affect interference section, implemented on the computer, that prepares in advance a function obtained by modeling spontaneous rhythm of human affect and generates an interference state by modulating said function with said mood factor; and an emotion transition section, implemented on the computer, that simulates the change in human emotion by causing the state transitions to occur in said emotional states based on said interference state. 3. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 1, further comprising an output generating section, implemented on the computer, that generates a scenario or motion as an output responding to said direction input by selecting, modifying, or combining prepared action pattern(s) in accordance with a selected mental-will state. 4. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 1, wherein said interest interpretation section: detects an emotional state of an direction input source based on said direction input; and collates the emotional state of the direction input source or said direction input and the emotional state of the direction input source with said hedonic interest relationship table to output the mood factor representing pleasure/displeasure. 5. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 4, wherein said interest interpretation section: collates said direction input with a predetermined purpose and application table to detect a purpose and application of said direction input; collates said direction input with a predetermined thought level table to detect at what thought level from a primitive level to an abstract level a thought of said other party is; and detects in further detail the emotional state of said other party by adding said purpose and application and said thought level as classification item data to the detected emotional state of said other party. 6. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 4, wherein said interest interpretation section: generates a PS-D parameter that converges from a paranoid-schizoid state to a depressive state in an oscillating or non-oscillating manner in accordance with the level of anxiety represented by the emotional state of said other party; and detects in further detail the emotional state of said other party by adding said PS-D parameter as classification item data to the detected emotional state of said other party. 7. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 1, wherein said emotion creating section: collates said mental-will state with the predetermined purpose and application table to detect a purpose and application of said mental-will state; collates said mental-will state with the predetermined thought level table to detect at what thought level from a primitive level to an abstract level said mental-will state is; and detects in further detail the emotional state of said device side by adding said purpose and application and said thought level as classification item data to said emotional state of the device side. 8. The will-expression modeling device according to claim 1, wherein said emotion creating section: generates a PS-D parameter that converges from a paranoid-schizoid state to a depressive state in an oscillating or non-oscillating manner in accordance with the level of anxiety represented by said emotional state of the device side; and detects in further detail the emotional state of said device side by adding said PS-D parameter as classification item data to said emotional state of the device side. 9. A psycho-effect program causing the computer to function as a will-expression modeling device according to claim 1. 10. A method of causing a computer to simulate human will-expression responding to a direction input given from the outside, the method comprising: collating, by the computer, said direction input with a predetermined hedonic interest relationship table and outputting a mood factor representing pleasure/displeasure; preparing, by the computer, a plurality of emotional states obtained by modeling human emotions and causing state transitions to occur in the emotional states according to said mood factor to simulate a change in human emotion; preparing, by the computer, in advance a plurality of mental-will states obtained by modeling human will and selecting a new mental-will state from said emotional states or a combination of a mental-will state and an emotional state, and when receiving an instruction input of encouragement or suppression based on a relationship between said direction input and said mental-will states being selected from an outside instructor, refining, by the computer, said hedonic interest relationship table in response to said instruction input to make said will-expression closer to human common sense and super-ego.
