The present invention relates to a manipulator having distributed mechanism for maximizing the performance of the manipulator. The manipulator is comprised of a first link; a second link; a joint for rotatably joining the first link and the second link each other; a connector having a first movable node at one end and a second movable node at the other end; a driver for providing power to linearly move the first movable node and the second movable node; and a guide for guiding the first movable node and the second movable node linearly. The first movable node is connected to the first link and is capable of linearly moving and rotating with respect to the first link. The second movable node is connected to the second link and is capable of linearly moving and rotating with respect to the second link.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A manipulator with distributed actuation mechanism, said manipulator comprising: a first link; a second link; a joint for rotatably joining said first link and said second link; a connector having a first movable node at one end and a second movable node at the other end, said first movable node being provided in the first link and capable of linearly moving and rotating with respect to the first link, said second movable node being provided in the second link and capable of linearly moving and rotating with respect to the second link; actuators for providing power to linearly move said first movable node and said second movable node; and guides connected to said actuators for guiding said first movable node and said second movable node linearly, wherein said actuators are provided in both of said first link and said second link, and said guides are provided in both of said first link and said second link. 2. The manipulator with distributed actuation mechanism as set forth in claim 1, wherein said connector is hydraulic or pneumatic operating device.
