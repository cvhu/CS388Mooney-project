Working method for treatment of abstract objects (the thought-substances) of the system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android for the pointer-oriented object acquisition method for abstract treatment of information of this system based on a natural language. The working method for treatment of abstract objects (the thought-substances) of the system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android for the pointer-oriented object acquisition method for abstract treatment of information of this system based on a natural language, in which an abstract object (an thought-substance) is compared with the other abstract objects (the other thought-substances). The working method is impelled by the system by itself. The abstract objects (the thought-substances) and/or the classes of the objects are processed discretely for each abstract object (each thought-substance). The abstract objects and the classes of abstract objects are classified by the system by itself subjective in a natural language only if the class of the objects is a verb in a natural language. With the working method more than ten internal directives of the abstract subjectivity of the system can be used.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A working method for treatment of abstract objects (the thought-substances) of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android for the pointer-oriented object acquisition method for tangible treatment of information of this system based on one natural language; with which the received signal-reaction of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android, the corresponding association of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android and the corresponding thought of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android which are physically substantiated in the computer system are the corresponding objects of the same class; with which the abstract object (the thought to the association) knows only the corresponding associative object (the association to the received signal, or rather the association to the received signal-reaction) but does not know the corresponding subjective object (the received signal, or rather the received signal-reaction) and neither, certainly, the surroundings; with which the abstract object (the thought to the association) is unique according to the complete words combination of the vocabulary of both the associative words and the abstract words to the associative words, or rather to the corresponding association; with which the computer system treats the abstract object (the thought to the association) relative to time but not uniquely; with which a reference in another natural language to the abstract object (to the thought substance) is used for working method in the other natural language, characterized in that the computer system classifies by itself all the particular physical areas of the Random Access Memory (RAM) in each of which one abstract object (which is the thought substance to the corresponding association substance (to the corresponding associative object)) which points to not less than two words is stored in a way of the thinking paradigm of the class-based model of OOP only if the class of the objects is a verb in the one natural language. 2. The working method according to claim 1, characterized in that the computer system treats the abstract objects, as well as the classes of the objects, in a not continuous treatment mode, or rather discretely for each abstract object. 3. The working method according to claim 2, characterized in that the treatment of the abstract objects, as well as the classes of the objects, is impelled from, that the abstract object is compared with the other abstract objects. 4. The working method according to claim 3, characterized in that the decision, whether an abstract object is to be treated and how the abstract object is to be handled within the bounds of the determined treatment mode, is determined with the classes classification of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of the cyborg or the android. 5. The working method according to claim 3, characterized in that the treatment mode is determined with the polymorphy of the classes classification of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of the cyborg or the android. 6. The working method according to claim 3, characterized in that more than ten internal directives can be used by the working method of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android. 7. The working method according to claim 6, characterized in that the relativity to time during this working method of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android can be implemented as six weekdays and one holiday. 8. A computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android for the working method for treatment of abstract objects (the thought substances) of this computer system based on one natural language; with which the received signal-reaction of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android, the corresponding association of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android and the corresponding thought of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android which are physically substantiated in the computer system are the corresponding objects of the same class; with which the computer system defines the class of all the three objects as an action in the one natural language; with which the sensor network of the computer system summarizes all reactions of all senses, or rather of all sense organs; with which the computer system provides for output the subjective object (the received signal, or rather the received signal-reaction) split according to the sensor groups, characterized in that the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of the cyborg or the android is assembled from the module of the associative subjectivity and the module of the abstract subjectivity. 9. The computer system according to claim 8, characterized in that the abstract objects, as well as the classes of the objects, are defined and treated with the module of the abstract subjectivity of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android in the one natural language. 10. A working method for treatment of abstract objects (the thought substances) of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android for the pointer-oriented object acquisition method for tangible treatment of information of this system based on one natural language; with which the received signal-reaction of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android, the corresponding association of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android and the corresponding thought of the computer system of Artificial Intelligence of a cyborg or an android which are physically substantiated in the computer system are the corresponding objects of the same class; with which the abstract object (the thought to the association) knows only the corresponding associative object (the association to the received signal, or rather the association to the received signal-reaction) but does not know the corresponding subjective object (the received signal, or rather the received signal-reaction) and neither, certainly, the surroundings; with which the abstract object (the thought to the association) is unique according to the complete words combination of the vocabulary of both the associative words and the abstract words to the associative words, or rather to the corresponding association; with which the computer system treats the abstract object (the thought to the association) relative to time but not uniquely; with which a reference in another natural language to the abstract object (to the thought substance) is used for working method in the other natural language, characterized in that the computer system classifies by itself the class of an abstract object (which is the thought substance to the corresponding association substance (to the corresponding associative object)) which points to not less than two words in a way of the thinking paradigm of the class-based model of OOP only if the class of the objects is a verb in the one natural language.
