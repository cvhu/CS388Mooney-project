The present invention provides devices and structures and methods of use thereof in electrochemical actuation. This invention provides electrochemical actuators, which are based, inter-alia, on an electric field-driven intercalation or alloying of high-modulus inorganic compounds, which can produce large and reversible volume changes, providing high actuation energy density, high actuation authority and large free strain.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electrochemical actuator, comprising: an electrode serving as a donor of an intercalating species; and a counterelectrode serving as an acceptor of the intercalating species, wherein at least one of intercalation and de-intercalation of said species in or from said electrode or said counterelectrode produces a change in volume in the actuator, such that a bend or other deformation is induced in at least one of the electrodes. 2. The electrochemical actuator of claim 1, wherein at least one of the electrodes undergoes a phase change, anisotropic expansion, or anisotropic contraction upon intercalation. 3. The electrochemical actuator of claim 1, wherein at least one of the electrodes includes a high elastic modulus compound. 4. The electrochemical actuator of claim 3, wherein the high elastic modulus compound has an elastic modulus ranging between 10-500 GPa. 5. The electrochemical actuator of claim 3, wherein the high elastic modulus compound has an elastic modulus ranging between 50-150 GPa. 6. The electrochemical actuator of claim 1, wherein the electrode includes lithium metal.
