One embodiment provides an attachment pad including a multilayer thermo-reversible adhesive including a shape memory polymer layer and a dry adhesive layer underlying the shape memory polymer layer, the multilayer thermo-reversible adhesive having a curved surface when the shape memory polymer layer is below its glass transition temperature and unaffected by a load; and a means for evenly applying a load and/or detaching force on the perimeter of the multilayer thermo-reversible adhesive including a spring.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method comprising: providing a climbing device including at least one movable arm or leg and an attachment pad attached thereto comprising a thermo-reversible dry adhesive comprising a shape memory polymer layer, and a dry adhesive layer over the shape memory polymer layer, a means for heating and cooling the thermo-reversible dry adhesive, and a means for applying pressure to the thermo-reversible dry adhesive comprising a spring; wherein shape recovery of the shape memory polymer layer is not constrained by the device; heating the thermo-reversible dry adhesive so that the shape memory polymer is at a temperature above its glass transition temperature, and placing the attachment pad on a wall and applying pressure to the thermo-reversible dry adhesive through the spring, and cooling the thermo-reversible dry adhesive so that the attachment pad is attached to the wall; and detaching the pad from the wall comprising heating the thermo-reversible dry adhesive layer and applying a relatively small pull-off or peel-off force to remove the pad from the wall. 2. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the shape memory polymer layer and the overlying dry adhesive layer each have a curved surface when the shape memory polymer layer is in an original shape at a temperature below the glass transition temperature thereof and without a load applied thereto. 3. A method comprising: providing a climbing device including at least one movable arm or leg and an attachment pad attached thereto comprising a thermo-reversible dry adhesive comprising a shape memory polymer layer, and a dry adhesive layer over the shape memory polymer layer, a means for heating and cooling the thermo-reversible dry adhesive, and a means for applying pressure to the thermo-reversible dry adhesive comprising a spring; heating the thermo-reversible dry adhesive so that the shape memory polymer is at a temperature above its glass transition temperature, and placing the attachment pad on a wall and applying pressure to the thermo-reversible dry adhesive through the spring, and cooling the thermo-reversible dry adhesive so that the attachment pad is attached to the wall; and detaching the pad from the wall comprising heating the thermo-reversible dry adhesive layer and applying a relatively small pull-off or peel-off force to remove the pad from the wall; wherein the shape memory polymer layer comprises: at least one of a rigid epoxy or a flexible epoxy; and at least one of a crosslinking agent or a catalytic curing agent; and wherein the rigid epoxy is an aromatic epoxy having at least two epoxide groups, the flexible epoxy is an aliphatic epoxy having at least two epoxide groups, and the crosslinking agent is one of a multi-amine, an organic multi-carboxylic acid, or an anhydride. 4. A method comprising: providing a climbing device including at least one movable arm or leg and an attachment pad attached thereto comprising a thermo-reversible dry adhesive comprising a shape memory polymer layer, and a dry adhesive layer over the shape memory polymer layer, a means for heating and cooling the thermo-reversible dry adhesive, and a means for applying pressure to the thermo-reversible dry adhesive comprising a spring; heating the thermo-reversible dry adhesive so that the shape memory polymer is at a temperature above its glass transition temperature, and placing the attachment pad on a wall and applying pressure to the thermo-reversible dry adhesive through the spring, and cooling the thermo-reversible dry adhesive so that the attachment pad is attached to the wall; and detaching the pad from the wall comprising heating the thermo-reversible dry adhesive layer and applying a relatively small pull-off or peel-off force to remove the pad from the wall; wherein the dry adhesive layer comprises: at least one of a rigid epoxy or a flexible epoxy; and at least one of a crosslinking agent or a catalytic curing agent; wherein the rigid epoxy is an aromatic epoxy having at least two epoxide groups, the flexible epoxy is an aliphatic epoxy having at least two epoxide groups, and the crosslinking agent is one of a multi-amine, an organic multi-carboxylic acid, or an anhydride. 5. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the attachment pad further comprises at least one other spring, and a bridge connecting said springs for applying an even load to the perimeter of the multilayer thermo-reversible adhesive. 6. A method as set forth in claim 5 wherein the attachment pad further comprises a rod connected to the bridge for applying a load to the bridge. 7. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the means for heating comprises a heating element in the spring.
