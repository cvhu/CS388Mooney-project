The present invention relate to methods of identifying a genotype-selective agent. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to agents that are selectively toxic to engineered human tumorigenic cells.
Claims What is claimed: 1. A method of identifying a cellular component involved in tumorigenesis, comprising: (a) contacting a cell with erastin; and (b) identifying a cellular component that interacts with erastin, wherein the cellular component that is identified is a cellular component involved in tumorigenesis. 2. A method of identifying a cellular component that interacts with erastin, comprising: (a) contacting a cell with erastin; and (b) identifying a cellular component that interacts with erastin, wherein the cellular component that is identified is a cellular component that interacts with erastin. 3. A method of identifying a cellular component involved in tumorigenesis, comprising: (a) contacting a cell with an inhibitor of erastin and contacting the cell with erastin; and (b) identifying a cellular component that interacts with the inhibitor in (a), wherein the cellular component that is identified is a cellular component involved in tumorigenesis. 4. A method of identifying a cellular component that interacts with erastin, comprising: (a) contacting a cell with an inhibitor of erastin and contacting the cell with erastin; and (b) identifying a cellular component that interacts with the inhibitor in (a), wherein the cellular component that is identified is a cellular component that interacts with erastin.
