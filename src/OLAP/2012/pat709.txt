A method for transferring a pattern from an elastic stamp to a substrate in the presence of a third medium is described. A proximity contact is achieved between the stamp and the substrate. A layer of the third medium between the stamp and the substrate is controlled to a predetermined thickness. Stamps for carrying out this method are also described.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An apparatus for transferring a pattern to a substrate in the presence of a third medium, comprising: a stamp comprising a plurality of first protrusions separated from one another by first drainage channels; each first protrusion further being subdivided into a plurality of smaller second protrusions separated from one another by smaller second drainage channels, with both the first and second drainage channels configured to guide excess portions of the third medium away from a contact surface of the stamp; and wherein the plurality of smaller protrusions are arranged in a hexagonal packing arrangement. 2. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of smaller protrusions have a circular cross section. 3. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second drainage channels form an open linked network.
