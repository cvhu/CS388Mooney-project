The present invention provides 5'-modified bicyclic nucleoside analogs and oligomeric compounds comprising at least one of these nucleoside analogs. In preferred embodiments the nucleoside analogs have either (R) or (S)-chirality at the 5'-carbon. These bicyclic nucleoside analogs are useful for enhancing properties of oligomeric compounds including for example enhanced nuclease resistance.
