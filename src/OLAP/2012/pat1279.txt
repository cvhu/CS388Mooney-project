An electrode (30) comprises a plate (31) having a major surface to which there has been attached an initially separate raised pattern (32) for guiding application of and/or retaining electrolyte paste adjacent the plate (31).
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A subassembly for use in fabricating an electrode comprising a plate having a major surface to which there has been attached an initially separate, non-conductive raised pattern free of electrolyte paste for guiding application of and/or retaining electrolyte paste adjacent the plate, the pattern extending to or towards the periphery of the major surface to leave edges of the plate exposed, said pattern including surfaces extending upwardly from a major surface of the plate and arranged to provide a plurality of cells spaced inwardly from the edges of the plate, wherein the plate is initially a smooth, generally featureless plate, and wherein the plate comprises a shaped substantially pore-free body of hardened resin and having electrical paths defined by contacting conductive particles. 2. The subassembly according to claim 1, wherein the conductive particles are titanium suboxide particles. 3. The subassembly according to claim 1, comprising a metallic interlayer between the pattern and the plate. 4. The subassembly according to claim 1, wherein the pattern comprises a lip located at or towards the periphery of one or both major surfaces of the plate. 5. The subassembly according to claim 1, wherein the pattern comprises a grid to define a plurality of cells for the application and retention of electrolytic paste. 6. The subassembly according to claim 1, wherein the non-conductive material is selected from cured epoxy resin or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. 7. A chemical cell, battery or power cell comprising the subassembly as defined in claim 1 with the electrolyte paste included thereon.
