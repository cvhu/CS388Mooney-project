A method for obtaining a desired dopant profile of an emitter for a solar cell which includes depositing a first amorphous silicon layer having a first doping level over an upper surface of the crystalline silicon substrate, depositing a second amorphous silicon layer having a second doping level on the first amorphous silicon layer, and heating the crystalline silicon substrate and the first and second amorphous silicon layers to a temperature sufficient to cause solid phase epitaxial crystallization of the first and second amorphous silicon layers, such that the first and second amorphous silicon layers, after heating, have the same grain structure and crystal orientation as the underlying crystalline silicon substrate.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for forming an emitter for a solar cell in a crystalline silicon substrate, comprising: depositing a first amorphous silicon layer lightly doped with phosphorous on an upper surface of the crystalline silicon substrate; heating the crystalline silicon substrate and the first lightly doped amorphous silicon layer at a temperature sufficient to diffuse the phosphorous in the lightly doped amorphous silicon layer into the crystalline silicon substrate; and depositing a second amorphous silicon layer on the first amorphous silicon layer, wherein a phosphorous doping concentration in an upper region and a bottom region of the second amorphous silicon layer is lower than a phosphorous doping concentration between the upper and bottom regions of the second amorphous silicon layer but higher than the first lightly doped amorphous silicon layer. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first amorphous silicon layer has phosphorous concentration of less than about 1.times.10.sup.18 atoms/cm.sup.3 and the second amorphous silicon layer has phosphorous concentration of higher than about 1.times.10.sup.22 atoms/cm.sup.3. 3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: depositing a passivation layer over an upper surface of the second amorphous silicon layer, wherein the passivation layer comprises silicon nitride, silicon oxide, or silicon oxynitride. 4. The method of claim 3, further comprises laser ablating the passivation layer in selected areas and simultaneously heating of the upper surface of the second amorphous silicon layer and the upper surface of the crystalline silicon substrate.
