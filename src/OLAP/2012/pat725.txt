A touch sensitive robot includes a body having a control panel, a touch sensor, a driver, and a controller. The touch sensor includes a first conductive belt, a second conductive belt, a power source, and a current sensor. The first conductive belt is wrapped on the body. The second conductive belt is wrapped around but spaced away from the first conductive belt. The power source and the current sensor are connected in series between the first conductive belt and the second conductive belt to form a closed circuit when a point of the second conductive belt is touched to contact the first conductive belt. The current sensor is for measuring the flow of the electrical current of the close loop. The controller is for controlling the driver to turn the body based upon the measurement of the current sensor to orient the control panel to the touch point.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A touch sensitive robot comprising: a body comprising an interaction section; a touch sensor comprising: a first conductive belt being wrapped on the body; a second conductive belt being wrapped around but spaced away from the first conductive belt; a power source and a current sensor connected in series between the first conductive belt and the second conductive belt, the touch sensor being configured for sensing a touch on the second conductive belt; a driver; and a controller configured for controlling the driver to turn the body based upon the measurement of the current sensor such that the interaction section substantially changes position to the point of the touch on the second conductive belt, wherein the body further comprises a circular bottom board, a dome-shaped shell, and a pair of wheels, the circular bottom board sealing the dome-shaped shell, the interaction section being mounted in the outer surface of the dome-shaped shell, the pair of wheels being movably fixed to the circular bottom board and capable of turning the body, wherein the body further comprises an attachment portion extending outwards from and encircling the circumferential surface of the circular bottom board, the touch sensor further comprises an isolating cover, the isolating cover covering the attachment portion and defining a space between the isolating cover and the attachment portion, the first conductive belt and the second conductive belt being received in the space, the first conductive belt being attached to the isolating cover, the second conductive belt being attached to the attachment portion, the first conductive belt and the second conductive belt facing but being spaced away from each other, and wherein in a cross-section taken along the diameter of the circular bottom board, the attachment portion comprises a connecting plate extending away from the circumference surface of the circular bottom board and an engaging plate extending away from the connecting plate, parallel to the circumference surface of the circular bottom board, the isolating cover comprises a cap-shaped covering section and two engaging flanges inwards from two ends of the cap-shaped covering section, the engaging flanges engaging with the engaging plate.
