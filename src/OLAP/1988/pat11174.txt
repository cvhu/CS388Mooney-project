A system for automated manufacture of a pressure vessel, the system including a cutting station at which an elongated cylinder is cut into a selected length forming the vessel shell, a first, second and third computer control shell indexing station, each indexing station having means to rotate the shell about its horizontal axis in response to computer control, a computer control multi-axes arm robot having means to grasp and manipulate a cutting torch and a welding torch, the robot moving to the first index station to cut holes in the shell at preselected locations and, at the second indexing station for welding piping fittings in the shell having holes cut therein, and at the third indexing station for welding a head on each end of the shell to close the vessel. In the preferred arrangement the robot is mounted on a track which runs parallel to the first, second and third indexing stations.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for the automated manufacture of a pressure vessel having a shell formed from an elongated length of cylindrical stock, comprising: a cutting station having means for axially horizontally receiving a portion of an elongated length of cylindrical stock thereon; means to cut said elongated length of cylindrical stock to a preselected length at said cutting station to form the vessel shell; a first computer controlled shell indexing station having means to rotate said shell about its horizontal cylindrical axis; a computer controlled, multi-axes, arm robot, the robot having means to grasp and manipulate a cutting torch and a welding torch; means to cut piping holes at preselected rotational and lonitudinal locations in said shell by the simultaneous positional controls of said robot and said first shell indexing station; a second computer controlled shell indexing station having means to rotate said shell about its horizontal cylindrical axis; means at said second indexing station to sequentially position piping components in engagement with said shell at piping holes cut in said shell; means to control said robot and said second shell indexing station to weld piping components to said shell; a third computer controlled shell indexing station having means to rotate said shell about its horizontal cylindrical axis; and means to control said robot and said third shell indexing station to weld heads onto said shell to close the ends thereof, said robot moving from said first, second and third indexing station in response to operator and computer controls, said shell being moved from said cutting station to said first, second and third indexing station in response to operator control. 2. A system for automated manufacture of a pressure vessel according to claim 1 including: a track having said robot thereon, the track running parallel said first, second and third indexing stations; and means to move said robot on said track in response to operator and computer control.
