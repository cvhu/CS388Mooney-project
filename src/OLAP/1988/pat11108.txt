An advanced servo manipulator has modular parts. Modular motor members drive individual input gears to control shoulder roll, shoulder pitch, elbow pitch, wrist yaw, wrist pitch, wrist roll, and tong spacing. The modules include a support member, a shoulder module for controlling shoulder roll, and a sleeve module attached to the shoulder module in fixed relation thereto. The shoulder roll sleeve module has an inner cylindrical member rotatable relative to the outer cylindrical member, and upon which a gear pod assembly is mounted. A plurality of shafts are driven by the gears, which are in turn driven by individual motor modules to transmit rotary power to control elbow pitch as well as to provide four different rotary shafts across the bendable elbow joint to supply rotary motive power to a wrist member and tong member.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A remotely maintainable modular servo manipulator having an anthropomorphic stance, comprising: central support means for supporitng the servo manipulator; a plurality of substantially identical motor modules; a gear pod module supporting and driven by said motor modules; a roll sleeve module capable of providing shoulder roll movements attached to said gear pod module; a shoulder module capable of shoulder pitch movements supporting said roll sleeve module, said shoulder module being attached to and supported by said central support means; a shoulder drive pod assembly attached to said shoulder module for providing rotary motive power thereto; an elbow module capable of pitch movement attached to said roll sleeve module; a wrist module capable of yaw, pitch, and roll motions attached to said elbow module, and; a tong attached to said wrist module; said tong and said wrist, elbow, sleeve and shoulder modules being interconnected through gear and torque tube power transmission means for transmitting power from individual motor modules to said tong and said wrist, elbow, sleeve and shoulder modules while facilitating remote disassembly and replacement of said tong and modules by having easily separable joints between all adjacent modules. 2. The manipulator of claim 1, wherein said gear pod module includes at least 6 gear paths; a housing member for housing said gear paths; and at least one pair of concentric shafts, each of which is independently driven by separate ones of said gear paths; each of said gear paths having an input gear adapted to receive rotary motive power from one of said motor modules. 3. The manipulator of claim 1 wherein said roll sleeve module comprises: an outer cylindrical wall attached to said shoulder module and movable therewith during shoulder pitch operations; an inner cylindrical member rotatably mounted within said outer cylindrical member, said inner cylindrical member being attached to and rotatable with said gear pod module at its upper end and said elbow module at its lower end; and an internal gear attached to said outer cylindrical wall, said internal gear being engaged by a pinion gear driven by one of said motor modules in said gear pod module to effect rotation of said gear pod module and said inner cylindrical member attached thereto. 4. An advanced servo manipulator, comprising: a central support member; a shoulder module connected to said central support member, said shoulder module having motor modules attached thereto for supplying rotary motive power thereto; a roll sleeve module connected to said shoulder module for rotation thereby; a gear pod module adapted to selectively rotate relative to an outer portion of said roll sleeve module, said gear pod module having a means for transmitting rotary power to an elbow module; an elbow module having means for receiving rotary motive power from said gear pod module to control elbow pitch and to provide motive power to a wrist module attached to said elbow module; a wrist module having means for receiving rotary motive power from said elbow module to control wrist yaw, roll and pitch motions and to operate a tong attached to said wrist module; said respective tong, wrist, elbow, sleeve, and shoulder modules being interconnected through gear and torque tube power transmission means for transmitting power from individual motor modules to said tong, wrist, elbow, sleeve, and shoulder modules while facilitating remote disassembly and replacement of said tong modules by having easily separable joints between all adjacent modules.
