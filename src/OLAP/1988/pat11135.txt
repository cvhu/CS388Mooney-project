A robot hand having six optical approach sensors each including a light emitting element and a light sensing element is disclosed. Each optical approach sensor is adapted to detect an object in the vicinity of the robot hand such that the object may be picked up or avoided. The sensor units are adapted to detect objects by reflecting light therefrom, receiving a portion of the reflected light and providing an output signal, the magnitude of which is proportional to the intensity of received light. An output circuit is responsive to the sensor output for determining the magnitude of the sensor output signal, and hence the distance which separates the approach sensing unit and the object. The output circuit thus provides a plurality of control signals which are used by a motion control processor to control the speed at which the robot moves.
Claims I claim: 1. Apparatus for controlling the movement of a robot hand in response to the distance between the robot hand and objects in the vicinity thereof, said apparatus comprising: distance sensing means for reflecting light from an object and receiving at least a portion of the reflected light such that the intensity of light received is indicative of the distance between the robot hand and the object, said distance sensing means being further adapted to provide a sensor signal output the magnitude of which is indicative of the intensity of received light; and control means for controlling the movement of the robot hand, said control means being responsive to said sensor signal for determining the distance between the robot hand and the object, said control means being further responsive to the determined distance for varying the speed at which the robot hand moves, said control means comprising output circuit means coupled to receive the output from said distance sensing means for determining when the robot hand is a predetermined distance from the object, said output circuit means being responsive to the sensor signal from said distance sensing means for providing first and second output signals, the first output signal indicating that the robot hand is a first predetermined distance from the object and the second output signal indicating that the robot hand is a second predetermined distance from the object, said output circuit means comprising a reference signal generator for generating first and second voltage signals each of a predetermined magnitude; and first and second voltage comparator means adapted to receive the first and second voltage signals, respectively, said first comparator means for providing the first output signal when the magnitude of the sensor signal exceeds the predetermined magnitude of the first voltage signal and said second comparator means for providing the second output signal when the magnitude of the sensor signal exceeds the predetermined magnitude of the second voltage signal. 2. Apparatus as recited in claim 1 wherein said output circuit means is responsive to the sensor signal for providing a third output signal indicating that the sensor signal has reached its maximum magnitude. 3. Apparatus as recited in claim 2 wherein said output circuit means comprises: differentiation means for differentiating the sensor signal to provide a slope signal having a magnitude indicative of the time rate of change in the sensor signal; and means for detecting a zero crossing of the slope signal, said zero cross detecting means being adapted to provide the third output signal upon detecting a positive to negative transition of the slope signal and further being adapted to provide the third output signal upon detecting a negative to positive transition of the slope signal.
