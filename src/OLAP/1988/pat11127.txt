A valve base for a fluid pressure valve system which is provided with integral exhaust flow control valve means which may be selectively mounted in an end of the valve base, or in a side of the valve base, or with an exhaust flow control valve means in an end of the valve base and another exhaust flow control valve means in a side of the valve base.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A valve base for a fluid pressure valve system, characterized by: (a) said valve base having a substantial rectangular configuration with top, bottom, front side, rear side, and end surfaces; (b) said valve base having an inlet pressure port formed in one of the valve surfaces, which communicates with an inlet pressure passage means in the valve base that terminates at the top surface of the valve base; (c) said valve base having a pair of cylinder ports formed in another of the valve surfaces, which communicate with separate cylinder supply and return passages in the valve base that terminate at the top surface of the valve base, on opposite sides of the inlet pressure passage means; (d) said valve base having a pair of exhaust ports formed in one of the valve surfaces, which communicate with separate horizontal exhaust passages in the valve base that communicate with separate vertical exhaust passages in the valve base that terminate at the top surface of the valve base, on the outer sides of the cylinder supply and return passages; (e) at least one of the separate horizontal exhaust passages has a flow control valve means operative therein for controlling the flow of fluid exhausting therethrough; (f) said at least one of the separate horizontal exhaust passages having a peripheral, circular valve seat formed therein; (g) said flow control valve means including a flow control valve chamber formed in the valve base and having an outer end open to the exterior of the base, and an inner end adjacent said circular valve seat; (h) said flow control means including a longitudinally movable control valve body mounted in said flow control valve chamber and having an inner end formed as a conically shaped valve for seating engagement with said circular valve seat; (i) a portion of the flow control valve chamber being formed hexagonal in cross section to slidably receive a peripheral hexagonal mating portion of the flow control valve body; and, (j) a rotatable screw shaft, fixed against longitudinal movement, mounted in the outer end of the flow control valve chamber and having an inner end rotatably engaged in a threaded inner bore formed in an outer end of the flow control valve body, and an outer end accessible from the exterior of the base, whereby the screw shaft can be rotated to move the flow control valve body longitudinally to move the conically shaped valve to a seating engagement with said circular valve seat or to a desired position away from the circular valve seat to allow a controlled flow of fluid exhausting through said at least one of the separate exhaust passages. 2. A valve base for a fluid pressure valve system, as defined in claim 1, characterized by: (a) each of said separate horizontal exhaust passages having a flow control valve means operative therein for controlling the flow of fluid exhausting therethrough. 3. A valve base for a fluid pressure valve system, as defined in claim 2, characterized by: (a) each of said flow control valve means being mounted in opposite ends of the valve base. 4. A valve base for a fluid pressure valve system, as defined in claim 2, characterized by: (a) each of said flow control valve means being mounted in one of the sides of the valve base.
