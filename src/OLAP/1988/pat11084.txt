An empty flatpack carrier sorting device sorts empty carriers by types according to the flatpack associated with said carrier. A vision system determines from an image of a flatpack component the number and location of the leads and the size of the flatpack and thus the type of carrier associated with that flatpack. Based upon this information, a computer directs the movement of a rotatable bin such that a selected storage location falls under a funnel through which an empty flatpack carrier falls as it is ejected from the automatic carrier feed and ejection device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An empty flatpack carrier sorting system, said empty flatpack carrier sorting system comprising: an automatic carrier feed and ejection means for positioning a loaded carrier having flatpacks therein at a pickup point and for removing an empty carrier from the pickup point; a robot means for selectively transporting said flatpacks from the pickup point to an assembly point, said robot means having a movable arm with pickup means attached thereto that removably attach to the flatpack in the loaded carrier; a camera means for observing the physical configuration of the flatpack after said robot means removes said flatpack from said loaded carrier; a vision system means for determining the shape of the flatpack and the number of leads therefrom, said camera means inputting an image into said vision system, said computer outputting configuration information as to the flatpack a computer, said computer receiving the configuration information from said vision system means and determining the type of carrier associated with the flatpack, said computer outputting a position signal indicative of a storage location in a bin where that empty carrier is to be deposited; an electronic interface means, for converting said position signal into a drive signal; means for controllably moving a bin to a particular position, said means for controllably moving receiving said drive signal from said electronic interface; said bin, said bin having a plurality of storage locations, said means for controllably moving attached to said bin, said means moving said bin such that a selected storage location is positioned under a feed funnel so that an empty carrier falls into said selected storage location; and a feedback means for indicating to said computer where said bin is positioned.
