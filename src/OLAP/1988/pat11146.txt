A floating electrical connector for rack and panel connector systems capable of being inserted into and reliably retained within an opening in a panel without tools and without separate fastening elements. The connector includes a connector housing having first and second transverse slots on opposed first and second sides of the housing within which portions of the opening defining edge of the panel extend when the connector is mounted to the panel for longitudinally retaining the connector on the panel while permitting limited longitudinal movement of the connector relative to the panel. The connector also includes first and second retention means for laterally retaining the first and second sides of the connector in the opening while permitting limited lateral movement of the connector relative to the panel. The connector is mountable within a limited space on a panel and can withstand substantial forces encountered while being mated with or disconnected from a complementary connector.

The connector of claim 1 wherein said second retention means comprises a resilient latching member extending from said connector, and wherein said second edge feature comprises a second recess in said opening defining edge, said latching member extending into said second recess when said connector is positioned within said opening for laterally retaining said second side of said connector in said opening while permitting limited lateral movement of said second side of said connector relative to said panel. 3. The connector of claim 1 wherein the width of said first and second slots is greater than the thickness of said panel for permitting limited longitudinal movement of said connector relative to said panel. 4. The connector of claim 1 wherein said resilient latching member includes a camming surface cooperating with said panel during insertion of said connector into said opening to permit insertion of said connector into said opening, and a locking surface extending into said second recess when said second side of said connector is positioned within said second recess for laterally retaining said second side of said connector in said opening while permitting limited lateral movement of said second side of said connector relative to said panel. 5. An electrical connector adapted to be float-mounted within a cutout in a panel, said cutout extending into said panel from a peripheral edge thereof and being partially defined by an opening defining edge of said panel, said opening defining edge including first and second recesses on substantially opposite sides of said cutout, said connector comprising: a connector housing having electrically conductive contact means extending longitudinally therethrough; means for defining first and second slots extending transversely into said housing from first and second substantially opposite sides of said connector for receiving portions of said opening defining edge of said panel when said connector is mounted within said cutout for longitudinally retaining said connector in said cutout, said first and second slots having a width greater than the thickness of said panel for permitting limited longitudinal movement of said connector relative to said panel; an internal rib within said first slot, said internal rib extending into said first recess when said connector is mounted within said cutout for laterally retaining said first side of said connector within said cutout while permitting limited lateral movement of said first side of said connector relative to said panel; and latching means on said connector, said latching means extending into said second recess when said connector is mounted within said cutout for laterally retaining said second side of said connector within said cutout while permitting limited lateral movement of said second side of said connector relative to said panel. 6. The connector of claim 1 wherein said connector housing further includes guide means for automatically aligning said connector with a complementary connector during mating therewith. 7. The connector of claim 6 wherein said latching means comprises a resilient latching member integral with said connector housing, said latching member permitting insertion of said second side of said connector into said cutout and thereafter engaging said second recess for preventing withdrawal of said second side of said connector from said cutout. 8. The connector of claim 7 wherein said latching member comprises a resilient arm integral with said housing and having a latching finger at the end thereof, said latching finger having a camming surface cooperating with said panel for permitting insertion of said connector into said cutout, and a locking surface extending into said second recess when said connector is positioned in said cutout for laterally retaining said second side of said connector in said cutout while permitting limited lateral movement of said second side of said connector relative to said panel. 9. An electrical connector adapted to be inserted into and retained within an opening in a panel, the opening including first and second substantially opposing edge portions, said connector comerising an article including; means for defining first and second slots extending transversely into said connector from first and second substantially opposite ends of said connector for receiving first and second edge portions respectively of said panel opening for longitudinally retaining said connector in said panel opening; and first and second retention means on said connector for cooperating with said first and second edge portions for retaining said connector in said panel opening while permitting limited lateral movement of said connector relative to said panel, said first retention means comprising forward and rearward flange portions extending outward from said first end of said connector comprising side walls of said first slot and said rearward flange portion extends outwardly a distance such that the distance between the outer end thereof and the bottom of said second slot exceeds the distance between said first and second edge portions of said panel cutout, and the distance between the outer end of the forward flange portion and said bottom of said second slot is less than said distance between said first and second edge portions of said panel cutout. 10. An electrical connector as set forth in claim 9 wherein said second retention means comprises a forward side of said second slot having an outer surface a distance from the bottom of said first slot less than the distance between said first and second edge portions of said panel cutout, and a resilient latching member extending from said second connector end first laterally therefrom and then parallel thereto to a free end and comprising a rearward side of said second slot, said latching member free end being deflectable toward said second connector end and having an outermost portion disposed outwardly a distance such that the distance between the outer edge thereof and the bottom of said first slot exceeds the distance between said first and second edge portions of said panel cutout when said latching member is undeflected and is less than said distance when deflected. 11. An electrical connector as set forth in claim 10 wherein said outermost portion of said latching member free end is adapted to urge the connector to a centered position vertically in said panel cutout when said latching member is undeflected. 12. A method of mounting an electrical connector to a panel through a cutout thereof comprising the steps of: extending a forward portion of a selected connector having a first side and a second side opposed thereto through a panel cutout between a first cutout edge and a second cutout edge opposed therefrom with said second cutout edge received into a second slot extending into said second side, said first cutout edge abutting a forward surface of a first flange portion of said first side forwardly of a first slot and therealong and a latching member along said second side abutting a stop means of said panel and undeflected thereby holding said connector spaced from said second cutout edge a selected distance; deflecting a free end of said latching member toward said second side and moving said connector toward said second cutout edge; moving said first flange portion along and past said first cutout edge and aligning said first cutout edge with said first slot; and allowing said free end of said latching member to resile moving said connector toward said first cutout edge whereby said first and second cutout edges are disposed in said first and second slots respectively.
