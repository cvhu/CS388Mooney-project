A programmable printing system for product marking applications is described in which a printing member is carried by an articulated mechanical arm, such as a robot arm. Due to the enhanced maneuverability and reach of the articulated arm, printing can be carried out on surfaces which would not be accessible to conventional types of conveyor-mounted product marking devices. The articulated arm is controlled by a programmable control means which can be reprogrammed as needed in order to print on objects having different sizes, shapes and orientations, or to print at more than one location on the same object. The apparatus finds particular utility in connection with pad transfer printing, including multicolor pad transfer printing, but is also applicable to other printing methods.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A multicolor printing method comprising: providing first and second engraved printing plates carrying print legends corresponding to first and second color components, respectively, of a multicolor image; inking said first and second printing plates with inks having first and second colors, respectively, and scraping said printing plates to leave ink only in the engraved areas which define the print legends; bringing a deformable transfer pad into contact with the first printing plate in order to pick up a first ink image therefrom corresponding to the first color component of the multicolor image; bringing the transfer pad into contact with a location on the print receiving surface in order to deposit the first ink image thereon; bringing the same transfer pad into contact with the second printing plate in order to pick up a second ink image therefrom corresponding to the second color component of the multicolor image; and bringing the transfer pad into contact with the same location on the print receiving surface in order to deposit the second ink image thereon. 2.
