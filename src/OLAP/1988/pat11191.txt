In a robotic system for efficient serialization of processing a number of samples by a robotic manipulator through an identical sequence of processing steps with a plurality of the samples being processed through the sequence at a given time, such that they must share the services of the manipulator, the improvement wherein a computer control means 92 operates a schedule-control feature which forms means both (a) to relate (1) the time within said sequence required to carry out all said steps which do not require the robotic manipulator (22) to (2) the time within said sequence which does require the robotic manipulator and the minimum number of processing spaces (305) for samples in non-robotic-manipulated time steps; and (b) to provide a priority of action for manipulator such that the sample which is both ready for further processing and most advanced in the sequence is given priority for further completion when said manipulator (22) is available for said further processing.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a robotic process for scheduling the moving of a plurality of samples through a sequence of processing steps, using robotic time of a robotic manipulator, and at least one of which steps takes some non-robotic time, and has said samples in process for a period of time without the need for tending by said robotic manipulator and wherein said sequence for some samples overlap in time with the sequence for other samples such that the manipulator's time is shared among a plurality of samples being processed during any given time, the steps of: (a) establishing cycle time for a sample which is non-robotic time divided by the smaller quantity of (1) the integer part of the ratio of non-robotic-manipulator time in said sequence to robotic manipulator time in said sequence and (2) the smallest number of sample-receiving spaces in a non-robotic step; (b) causing said robot manipulator, when available, to process each sample ready to be advanced in, or brought into, the procedure on a sample priority based on the last step in said procedure being given highest priority and the first step in said procedure given lowest priority; and (c) if the robot manipulator is not available, causing said manipulator to proceed to take a sample it is handling into the next step of said procedure and perform the operations for said next step, said cycle time establishing step and said priority-establishing steps, together forming means to assure highly-efficient serial handing of said samples under highly-repetitive conditions. 2. A process as defined in claim 1 wherein the time used by the robotic operations in said steps is entered into the robot control system and used to update the sample cycle time. 3. A robotic system for processing a number of discrete items of material serially through a preselected sequence of steps which sequence includes at lesat one step comprising use of a robotic manipulator and at least one step in which there is time which does not require the use of a robotic manipulator, said system comprising, (a) robotic manipulator; (b) processing devices for handling or processing said items of material; and (c) computer control means for controlling how the manipulator's time is shared among a plurality of samples being processed through different steps in said sequence during a given time period; wherein said computer control means comprises schedule-control code means which form means to; (d) relate (1) the time within said sequence required to carry out said steps which do not require the robotic manipulator to (2) the time within said sequence which does require the robotic manipulator and the minimum number of processing spaces for samples in non-robotic-manipulator time steps; and (e) provide a priority of action for said robotic manipulator such that a sample which is both ready for further processing and is most advanced in the sequence is given priority for further processing or completion when sid robotic manipulator is available for said further processing. 4. In a robotic process for scheduling the moving each of a plurality of items by a robotic manipulator through a sequence of processing steps using robotic time and non-robotic time, wherein a number of said items are being processed through different steps in said sequence at the same time the improvement comprising the steps of: recomputing a cycle time for each item and modifying the schedule in response to actual robotic-manipulator time usage in each step and the total time used for each step in which there is time when no robotic manipulator is being used. 5. A process as defined in claim 4 wherein each processing step for each item, except the terminal step in a sequence, is defined as ending with the robotic manipulator holding an item being processed.
