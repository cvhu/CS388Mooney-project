A system for interchangeably mounting tools on a robotic arm includes a clamping assembly having a core attached to and extending longitudinally from the arm, and two opposed clamping members mounted for transverse sliding on the core. A tool support member is held in the clamping assembly, when it is closed, by guide pins extended transversely from the clamping members engaged with legs of the tool support member. The support member and clamping members have conduit portions that form continuous fluid conduits and electrical paths when the support member is secured in the clamping assembly. A collet housing is supported relative to the tool support member by a linear extension device, a compliant wrist, and an overload protect wrist, which together allow limited longitudinal, transverse and angular displacement of the collet housing relative to the arm.
