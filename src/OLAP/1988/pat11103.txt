This invention provides for a method and apparatus for assembly of complex systems by human operators with the assistance of automatic machinery. The machinery employes a lighted probe to direct the operator to insert a part of the lighted location and the machinery tests for proper seating of the part. The machinery is integrated into a larger automated system which enhances its automatic part location indicating function by allowing and correcting for mislocation of real world coordinates from ideal coordinates. Also taught is a method for integration fo the assembly operation from the design stage through the production phase.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for inserting parts into predetermined hole locations on a substantially planar structure, such that each particular part may be mated to each particular location identifiable by particular part location data, until all the parts are mated to their predetermined locations, comprising at least the steps: (a) sending the location data for a part location to an automatic positioning mechanism equipped with a lighted probe and being located on one side of said substantially planar structure, (b) automatically moving said lighted probe to said part location indicated by the location data from step "a". (c) pushing said probe into said location such that the light of said probe may be visible to an operator on the other side of said planar structure, (d) inserting said part into said location by said operator with force sufficient to push said lighted probe backward from said planar structure, (e) release by said operator of said part, (f) testing the seating of said part in said location by attempting insertion of said probe, (g) if the part is improperly seated, signalling the operator to correct, then trying again by repeating this method starting at step "c", unless the probe is already inserted in which case then start at step "d" otherwise, if part is properly seated going to step "h", (h) querying whether all parts have been inserted; if so signal the operator to do next task, else, (i) go to step "a" 2. The product of the method for inserting parts into predetermined hole locations on a substantially planar structure, such that each particular part may be mated to each particular location identifiable by particular part location data until all the parts are mated to their predetermined locations, comprising at least the steps: (a) sending the location data for a part location to an automatic positioning mechanism equipped with a lighted probe and being located on one side of said substantially planar structure, (b) automatically moving said lighted probe to said part location indicated by the location data from step "a", (c) pushing said probe into said location such that the light of said probe may be visible to an operator on the other side of said planar structure, (d) inserting said part into said location by said operator with force sufficient to push said lighted probe backward from said planar structure, (e) release by said operator of said part, (f) testing the seating of said part in said location by attempting insertion of said probe, (g) if the part is improperly seated, signalling the operator to correct, then trying again by repeating this method starting at step "c" unless the probe is already inserted in which case then start at step "d", otherwise, if part is properly seated going to step "h", (h) querying whether all parts have been inserted; if so, signal operator to do next task, else, (i) go to step "a". 3. An integrated computer-aided wiring assembly method for wiring a substantially planar structure employing a set of automated equipment including a host computer, an assembly computer, and a controller, wherein the host computer is for use by a designer to develop a wiring scheme for the interconnections necessary to connect circuits on bus boards in bus board matrix and to compile the wiring scheme into wiring lists wherein each wire has a designated type and size and a sesignated hole location for each end and wherein the wiring list is accessible by said assembly computer capable fo tracking wiring progress and delivering wiring list information to an operator and to an automatic positioning apparatus wherein said automatic positioning apparatus is controlled by said controller for delivering a lighted probe to a designated hole location in said planar structure in such a form that said apparatus and assembly computer can interpret the information as pairs designated hole locations in its operating envelope; wherein the method includes the steps (a) producing, with the assistance of said host computer a wiring data base of connections including the physical locations for insertion, lengths, and types of wires to be inserted therein, (b) dividing said data base into wiring lists and sorting each said wiring list within the host computer, (c) providing the wiring lists to the assembly computer, (d) the operator gets indicated type and size of wire required by the wiring lists, (e) the automatic positioning apparatus moves the lighted probe to the designated location on the wiring list, (f) the operator inserts designated wire end into hold through which probe light is visible and gets next wire or wire end, if needed, (g) lighted probe tests for the seating of said wire end, (h) if the wire end is improperly seated, the operator to correct, then go to step "g", else move the probe to the next hole on list, then repeat from step "f", (j) if done with bus board matrix then stop else, inform the operator to, or automatically retrieve next wire list and inform the operator to change wire size and type and make any other required adjustments then repeat from step "d". 4. A computer-aided assembly method for placing parts in a substantially planar structure employing a set of automated equipment including an assembly computer, and a controller, wherein a list of designated parts and designated locations for them in said planar structure is developed by a designer wherein said list is accessible by said assembly computer capable of tracking assembly progress and delivering list information to an automatic positioning apparatus wherein said automatic positioning apparatus is controlled by said controller for delivering a lighted probe to a given hole location in said planar structure in such a form that said apparatus and assembly computer can interpret the information as pairs of designated hole locations in its operating envelope; wherein the method includes the steps: (a) an operator gets a designated part as required by the part list, (b) the automatic positioning apparatus moves the lighted probe to the first location on the part list, (c) the operator inserts appropriate part into hole through which probe light is visible and gets next part, if needed, (d) lighted probe tests for the seating of the part, (e) if the part is improperly seated, the operator is to correct, then go to step "d", else move probe to the next hole on list, then, repeat from step "c", (f) if done with structure then stop, else, inform the operator to, or automatically retrieve, next part list and inform the operator to make any required adjustments then repeat from step "d".
