The invention discloses a method of determining the position and orientation of an element (such as a platform) in space by determining the intersection of a line with a plane (or with another line). Three different implementations are disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of sensing the position and orientation of elements in space, comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of non-colinear light sources on an element which is movable in space; providing a pair of cameras at positions spaced from said element; recording with each of said cameras the images of said light sources as to identity and location along a specific line in space; calculating the intersection of said lines in space to determine the portion of each light source in space; and calculating from the calculated intersection and the known location of the light sources on the element, the orientation and the position of the element itself in space. 2. A method of sensing the positional orientation of elements in space, comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of light sensors on an element which is movable in space; providing a pair of light projectors at positions spaced from said element; directing light beams from said projectors at said light sensors; modulating the angular position of said light beams over time; and correlating the time of illumination of each sensor with the position of the projected beam at the time of such illumination, so as to determine the angular position of each sensor with respect to each of said projectors. 3. A method of sensing the positional orientation of elements in space, comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of non-colinear different-color light reflectors on an element which is movable in space; directing light beams at said reflectors from a plane projector located at a position spaced from said element; recording, with a color camera and at another position remote from said element and from said projector, the light reflected by each of said reflectors; identifying the recording of light from each reflector by color; and determining the position in space of each reflector as the intersection of the camera image position and the light plane of the projector.
