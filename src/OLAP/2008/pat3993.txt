The automatic work apparatus extracts the target image of which photos are taken by the left and right CCD cameras, specifies the spatial position of the target and executes an operation to the target by the arm. Two regions, the central region and the peripheral ones, allocated to the image taken by the CCD camera so that if the target image stays in the peripheral region of the image then the cameras are rotated to take the target image in the central portion and the position determining module determines the spatial position of the target and then tasks are done for the targets. The relative distance from the target is adjusted by transfer equipment. This invention is applicable to an automatic work apparatus that can operate a predetermined operation for moving target and an automatic operation control program to carry out such operation.
