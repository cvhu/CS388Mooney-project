There is disclosed an improvement to a system, apparatus, method, and computer program product relating to a novel events-notification activity occurring within computer network environments including SAN, NAS and client server environments. A user at a convenient, single user-interface location in a network is enabled to establish such activity by creating and deploying template software objects which are configurable with respect to both events of interest and genre of notifications of such events. Accordingly, such user, operating at the user-interface at a client or head-end station and employing such templates, can select: (1) which particular network-failure events (from complete failures to measured degradations), such as those occurring in peripherals including disk array storage devices, are to be reported; (2) to whom such events shall be reported, worldwide; and, (3) the mode of communication by which such events shall be reported such as email, telephone, pager, etc. In those instances where certain databases in storage devices of servers employed throughout the network may contain templates which present name/content conflicts with client database templates the events-notification activity is less effective than it otherwise would be. There is disclosed a system, apparatus, method, and computer program product for handling such conflicts and thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the events-notification activity. An alternative embodiment of this solution handles the scenario where multiple networks having multiple clients sharing particular servers create template name/content conflicts.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An improvement to an events notification system deployed across multiple client-server networks including a first client operatively coupled with a first plurality of servers and a second client operatively coupled with a second plurality of servers, said first client deploying a template at each of said first plurality of servers and said second client deploying a template at each of said second plurality of servers for purposes of (a) communicating operating states of peripherals connected to said first plurality of servers and said second plurality of servers to their respective clients, (b) selecting type of notification to be initiated under specified failure mode conditions detected in any of said peripherals, and (c) taking action in accordance with said type of notification upon detection of said conditions, said improvement comprising: under conditions of said first client being operatively coupled to at least one of said second plurality of servers having at least one template of said second plurality of servers in conflict with at least one template associated with said first client, said first client updating said at least one template of said second plurality of servers to provide an updated template that avoids said conflict with said at least one template associated with said first client. 2. In the improved events-notification system of claim 1 said second client updating certain templates in its database which conflict with said updated template to conform to said updated template. 3. An improvement to an events notification method employable within multiple client-server networks including a first client operatively coupled with a first plurality of servers and a second client operatively coupled with a second plurality of servers, said first client deploying a template at each of said first plurality of servers and said second client deploying a template at each of said second plurality of servers for purposes of (a) communicating operating states of peripherals connected to said first plurality of servers and said second plurality of servers to their respective clients, (b) selecting type of notification to be initiated under specified failure mode conditions detected in any of said peripherals, and (c) taking action in accordance with said type of notification upon detection of said conditions, said improvement comprising: under conditions of said first client being operatively coupled to at least one of said second plurality of servers having at least one template of said second plurality of servers in conflict with at least one template associated with said first client, said first client updating said at least one template of said second plurality of servers to provide an updated template that avoids said conflict with said at least one template associated with said first client. 4. In the improved events-notification method of claim 3 said second client updating certain templates in its database which conflict with said updated template to conform to said updated template.
