The present invention generally relates to methods of modifying the glycosylation structures of recombinant proteins expressed in fungi or other lower eukaryotes, to more closely resemble the glycosylation of proteins from higher mammals, in particular humans. The present invention also relates to novel enzymes and, nucleic acids encoding them and, hosts engineered to express the enzymes, methods for producing modified glycoproteins in hosts and modified glycoproteins so produced.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for modifying glycosylation structures on glycoproteins expressed in a eukaryotic host cell comprising: expressing in said host cell a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide having an endomannosidase activity that is targeted to a vesicular compartment within the host cell, wherein said nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide having an endomannosidase activity is selected from the group consisting of (a) SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3; and (b) a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4. 2. A method for modifying glycosylation structures on glycoproteins expressed in a lower eukaryotic host cell comprising expressing in the host cell a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide having an endomannosidase activity, wherein said nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide having an endomannosidase activity is selected from the group consisting of (a) SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3; and (b) a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4.
