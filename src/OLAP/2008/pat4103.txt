A method for constructing a three-dimensional laminar body of large dimensions is provided. Starting from a true-to-scale model of the three-dimensional laminar body to be obtained, which comprises the entirety of said body or parts thereof, one or several negative molds which unitarily or together comprise the entire working surface of the three-dimensional laminar body are shaped on the model, and then used to mold, with a fine finish, the entire three-dimensional laminar body or the different constituent parts thereof.
Claims That which is claimed: 1. A method of constructing a reproduction of a three-dimensional laminar body having a finished outer surface, comprising: forming at least one first negative mold on a full scale model of the three-dimensional laminar body; compartmentalizing the at least one first negative mold into juxtaposed first negative mold portions, the first negative mold portions being configured to cooperate to collectively define the entire outer surface of the three-dimensional laminar body; forming a positive mold on each of the first negative mold portions; forming a second negative mold on each of the positive molds, each second negative mold being configured to have a finished surface defining a portion of the three-dimensional laminar body, whereby the second negative molds are configured to be cooperable to collectively define the three-dimensional laminar body, including the outer surface thereof, and forming a portion of a reproduction of the three-dimensional laminar body on each of the second negative molds, each portion of the reproduction having a finished outer surface in correspondence with the corresponding second negative mold, contiguous portions of the reproduction thereby being joinable to form the reproduction of the three-dimensional laminar body. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein compartmentalizing the at least one first negative mold further comprises delimiting the at least one first negative mold by filling the at least one first negative mold with a conforming rigid mass, and then removing a portion of the rigid mass, the portion of the first negative mold having the portion of the rigid mass removed therefrom thereby defining one of the first negative mold portions. 3. A method according to claim 1, wherein compartmentalizing the at least one first negative mold further comprises delimiting the at least one first negative mold by dividing the at least one negative mold with at least one partition inserted therein, the portion of the at least one first negative mold divided by the at least one partition thereby defining one of the first negative mold portions. 4. A method according to claim 1, wherein compartmentalizing the at least one first negative mold further comprises delimiting the at least one first negative mold such that each first mold portion includes a continuous perimetric flange extending thereabout, the perimetric flanges being reproduced in the corresponding portions of the reproduction formed on the second negative molds, whereby the perimetric flanges of contiguous portions of the reproduction are complementarily configured and capable of being coupled together. 5. A method according to claim 4, further comprising coupling the complementary perimetric flanges of contiguous portions of the reproduction together by interposing a seal therebetween and applying a clamp device across the flanges. 6. A method according to claim 4, wherein the perimetric flange of each of the portions of the reproduction include at least one of a projection and a receptacle, the projection and receptacle being complementarily configured with respect to each other, and the method further comprises engaging the flanges of contiguous portions of the reproduction such that the projection of the flange of one portion engages the receptacle of the flange of the other portion so as to align the contiguous portions. 7. A method according to claim 1, wherein the reproduction of the three-dimensional laminar body comprises a substantially below-waterline portion of a vessel hull and a substantially above-waterline portion of the vessel hull, the substantially above-waterline and substantially below-waterline portions being configured to be coupled together, each of the substantially above-waterline and substantially below-waterline portions being comprised of a plurality of molded parts, and the method further comprises coupling contiguous molded parts of the substantially above-waterline portion together and coupling contiguous molded parts of the substantially below-waterline portion together, the contiguous molded parts of the substantially above-waterline portion being configured to have inclined joints formed therebetween, whereby the inclined joints of the substantially above-waterline portion are staggered with respect to joints between the contiguous molded parts of the substantially below-waterline portion.
