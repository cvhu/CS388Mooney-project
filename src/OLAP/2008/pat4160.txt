The present invention relate to methods of identifying a genotype-selective agent. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to agents that are selectively toxic to engineered human tumorigenic cells.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inducing death in tumor cells, comprising contacting the cells with a compound selected from the group consisting of: (a) a compound having the following formula: ##STR00001## (b) a compound having the following formula: ##STR00002## 2. A method of inducing death in cells in which the RAS pathway is activated, comprising contacting the cells with a compound selected from the group consisting of: (a) a compound having the following formula: ##STR00003## (b) a compound having the following formula: ##STR00004## 3. A method of inducing death in human cells expressing SV40 small T oncoprotein and oncogenic HRAS, comprising contacting the human cells with a compound selected from the group consisting of: (a) a compound having the following formula: ##STR00005## (b) a compound having the following formula: ##STR00006## 4. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound having the following formula: ##STR00007## which is selectively toxic to engineered human tumorigenic cells. 5. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound having the following formula: ##STR00008## which is selectively toxic to engineered human tumorigenic cells.
