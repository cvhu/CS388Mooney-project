A bonding apparatus for fabricating a liquid crystal display device includes a vacuum chamber for bonding first and second substrates together, an upper stage and a lower stage oppositely arranged in an upper space and a lower space of the vacuum chamber, and a pressure application system coupled to one of the upper and lower stages for applying first and second pressures to different parts of the one of the upper and lower stages.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A supplemental pressure application system in a bonding apparatus for bonding first and second substrates of a liquid crystal display device together, comprising: a removable pressure application mask having a plurality of projection parts attached to one of an upper stage and a lower stage of the bonding apparatus by coupling slots that receive coupling portions of the projection parts and projecting toward a sealant region of one of the first and second substrates.
