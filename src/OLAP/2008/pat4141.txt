It has now been found that certain novel N-(substituted aryl)-4-(disubstituted methyl)piperidine and pyridine derivatives have provided unexpected insecticidal activity. These compounds are represented by formula (I): wherein m, n, q, r, and s are independently selected from 0 or 1; and p is 0, 1, 2, or 3; A is CH or N; and B, D, E, R, R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, R.sup.6, R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 are fully described herein. In addition, compositions comprising an insecticidally effective amount of at least one compound of formula I, and optionally, an effective amount of at least one of a second compound, with at least one insecticidally compatible carrier are also disclosed; along with methods of controlling insects comprising applying said compositions to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present.

The insecticidal composition of claim 3, further comprising at least one additional insecticide. 5. A composition containing an insecticidally effective amount of a compound of claim 2 in admixture with at least one agriculturally acceptable extender or adjuvant. 6. The insecticidal composition of claim 5, further comprising at least one additional insecticide. 7. A method of controlling tobacco budworm, comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition of claim 1 to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present. 8. A method of controlling tobacco budworm, comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition of claim 2 to a locus where insects are present or are expected to be present. 9. The compound of claim 1, where B is NNR.sup.15C(.dbd.0)*; R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.5, R.sup.6, R.sup.27 and R.sup.28 are hydrogen, R.sup.4 is --OCF.sub.3, and R.sup.24 is 2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl.
