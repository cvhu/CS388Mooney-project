The present invention provides methods for identifying an agent that specifically binds and/or modulates one topology of chemokine receptor but not a second topology of the receptor. Such agents are useful as therapeutics for diseases or conditions associated with a particular chemokine receptor topology. Moreover, the agents are useful for detecting a particular topology of a chemokine receptor, thereby diagnosing disease or predisposition for a disease. In addition, the agents are useful for identifying and isolating cells that express a particular topology of a chemokine receptor.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of identifying an agent that binds to a chemokine receptor having a first topology but does not bind to a chemokine receptor having a second topology, the method comprising, i. providing a first cell comprising the chemokine receptor having the first topology and a second cell comprising the chemokine receptor having the second topology, wherein the chemokine receptor is selected from the group consisting of CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR5, CXCR6, CX3CR1, CXR1, CCXCKR (CCR11), US28, ECRF3, Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus GPCR, Poxvirus membrane-bound G Protein-coupled receptors, D6, and DARC. ii. contacting an agent to the chemokine receptor; and iii. selecting an agent that binds to the chemokine receptor having the first topology, but does not bind to the chemokine receptor having the second topology, wherein the chemokine receptor having the first topology and the chemokine receptor having the second topology have the same amino acid sequence. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent is less than 600 daltons. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises selecting an agent that modulates intracellular signaling triggered by ligand binding to the first topology of the chemokine receptor, thereby identifying the agent that modulates intracellular signaling triggered by ligand binding to the chemokine receptor having the first topology but not the second topology. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the agent modulates mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to binding of a ligand to the first topology of the chemokine receptor. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first cell or the second cell is a cancer cell. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the first cell or the second cell is a neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, eosinophil, basophil, mast cell or B cell. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first cell or the second cell is not a T-cell. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent competes for binding with a chemokine ligand of the chemokine receptor. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent is less than 1,500 daltons. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent is an antibody. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein the chemokine receptor is CCR1. 12. A method of identifying novel topologies of a chemokine receptor the method comprising; providing a cell type and a second cell type, each cell type expressing a chemokine receptor selected from the group consisting of CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR6, CX3CR1, CXR1, CCXCKR (CCR11), US28, ECRF3, Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus GPCR, Poxvirus membrane-bound G Protein-coupled receptors, D6, and DARC; testing a plurality of different chemokines for the ability to bind to the chemokine receptor on the two cell types; and identifying a chemokine, wherein the chemokine binds to the chemokine receptor on the first cell type, but does not bind to the chemokine receptor on the second cell type, thereby identifying novel topologies of the chemokine receptor. 13. The method of claim 12, wherein at least 3 cell types are tested. 14. The method of claim 12, wherein at least 10 chemokines are tested. 15. The method of claim 12, wherein the chemokines are selected from the group consisting of CL1, XCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL4, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL7, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, CXCL13, CXCL14, CXCL15, CXCL16, CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL6, CCL7, CCL8, CCL9, CCL10, CCL11, CCL12, CCL13, CCL14, CCL15, CCL16, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL23, CCL24, CCL25, CCL26, CCL27, and CCL28. 16. The method of claim 12, wherein the chemokines are tethered to a solid support. 17. The method of claim 12, wherein the testing step comprises determining the ability of the chemokines to compete with a ligand that binds to the chemokine receptor in each cell type. 18. The method of claim 17, wherein the ligand is labeled. 19. The method of claim 12, wherein at least one cell type expresses an endogenous chemokine receptor. 20. The method of claim 12, wherein at least one cell type expresses a recombinantly expressed chemokine receptor. 21. The method of claim 12, wherein the cell types tested comprise a cancer cell and a non-cancer cell. 22. The method of claim 12, wherein the chemokine receptor is CCR1.
