The present invention relates to nucleic acid synthesizers and methods of using and modifying nucleic acid synthesizers. For example, the present invention provides highly efficient, reliable, and safe synthesizers that find use, for example, in high throughput and automated nucleic acid synthesis, as well as methods of modifying pre-existing synthesizers to improve efficiency, reliability, and safety.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for decreasing the quantity of vapor emissions released into the surrounding atmosphere created during the use of an oligonucleotide synthesizer, said method comprising; a) providing an oligonucleotide synthesizer, wherein said oligonucleotide synthesizer comprises a reaction chamber and a lid enclosure, said lid enclosure containing a ventilation system, wherein in an open position, said lid enclosure provides a substantially ventilated workspace via said ventilation system in said lid enclosure, wherein in said open position said ventilated workspace is of sufficient size to permit an operator's hands to enter said reaction chamber; b) connecting said oligonucleotide synthesizer ventilation system to a source of negative pressure or vacuum; and c) operating said source of negative pressure or vacuum only when said lid enclosure comprising a ventilation system is in said open position; wherein said method is utilized while operating said oligonucleotide synthesizer to synthesize one or more oligonucleotides. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said operating of said source of negative pressure or vacuum is triggered to occur automatically whenever said lid enclosure is placed in said open position.
