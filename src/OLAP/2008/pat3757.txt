The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating the expression of growth factor gene. In particular, this invention relates to compounds, particularly oligonucleotide compounds, which, in preferred embodiments, hybridize with nucleic acid molecules encoding the Insulin Like Growth Factor I receptor (IGF-I receptor or IGF-IR) and in particular human IGF-IR. Such compounds are exemplified herein to modulate proliferation which is relevant to the treatment of proliferative and inflammatory skin disorders and cancer. It will be understood, however, that the compounds can be used for any other condition in which the IGF-IR is involved including inflammatory conditions.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A compound 12 to 80 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human IGF-IR, wherein said compound is at least 90% complementary with a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO: 97 encoding human IGF-IR, and wherein said compound comprises at least an 8- contiguous nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 125. 2. The compound of claim 1 comprising 12 to 50 nucleobases in length. 3. The compound of claim 2 comprising 12 to 30 nucleobases in length. 4. The compound of claim 1 comprising an oligonucleotide. 5. The compound of claim 4 comprising an antisense oligonucleotide. 6. The compound of claim 4 comprising a DNA oligonucleotide. 7. The compound of claim 4 comprising an RNA oligonucleotide. 8. The compound of claim 4 comprising a chimeric oligonucleotide. 9. The compound of claim 4 wherein at least a portion of said compound hybridizes with RNA to form an oligonucleotide-RNA duplex. 10. The compound of claim 1 having at least 95% complementarity with a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO: 97 . 11. The compound of claim 1 having at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety, or nucleobase. 12. The compound of claim 1 having at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 13. The compound of claim 1 having at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 14. The compound of claim 1 having at least one 5-methylcytosine. 15. The compound of claim 1 wherein the compound is ISIS 175317 (SEQ ID NO: 125). 16. A kit or assay device comprising the compound of claim 1. 17. A method of treating an animal having a disease or condition associated with IGF-IR comprising administering to said animal a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the compound of claim 1 so that expression of IGF-IR is inhibited. 18. A method for ameliorating the effects of a medical disorder associated with IGF-IR in a mammal, said method comprising contacting a cell involved with said medical disorder with an effective amount of a compound of claim 1 so that expression of IGF-IR is inhibited. 19. The method of claim 16 wherein the compound inhibits or otherwise reduces IGF-IR mRNA or protein. 20. The method of claim 17 wherein the disorder associated with IGF-IR is a skin disorder selected from psoriasis, ichthyosis, pityriasis, rubra, pilaris, serborrhoea, keloids, keratosis, neoplasias, scleroderma, warts, benign growths or cancers of the skin. 21. The method of claim 17 wherein the skin condition is psoriasis. 22. The method of any one of claims 17 to 19 wherein the mammal is a human. 23. The method of claim 18 wherein the phosphorothioate nucleic acid molecule is ISIS 175317 (SEQ ID NO: 125). 24. A method of ameliorating the effects of psoriasis, said method comprising contacting proliferating skin or skin capable of proliferation with an effective amount of SEQ ID NO: 125 and one or more phosphorothioate nucleic acid molecules or chemical analogs thereof capable of inhibiting or otherwise reducing IGF-I mediated cell proliferation wherein the nucleic acid molecules are selected from SEQ ID NO:1 through 75 and SEQ ID NO:100 through 136. 25. The method of claim 24 wherein the mammal is a human. 26. The method of claim 24 wherein the one or more phosphorothioate nucleic acid molecule is selected from ISIS 175308 (SEQ ID NO:116), ISIS 175302 (SEQ ID NO:110), ISIS 175314 (SEQ ID NO:122), ISIS 175307 (SEQ ID NO:115), and ISIS 175323 (SEQ ID NO:131). 27. The method of claim 24 wherein the one or more phosphorothioate nucleic acid molecule is selected from ISIS 323744 (SEQ ID NO:50), ISIS 323747 (SEQ ID NO:53), ISIS 323767 (SEQ ID NO:73), ISIS 323762 (SEQ ID NO:68) and ISIS 323737 (SEQ ID NO:43). 28. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 wherein every internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 29. The composition of claim 28 wherein the compound is ISIS 175317 (SEQ ID NO:125).
