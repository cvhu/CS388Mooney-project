The present invention relates to a storage device comprising an antenna for transmission of data to and/or from a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. More specifically, the invention relates to a low or ultra-low temperature storage device comprising an antenna for transmission of data between a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and an RFID tag transceiver and its use for item identification, organization, classification, databasing, tracking or locating.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A low or ultra-low temperature storage device comprising an antenna for transmission of data between a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and an RFID tag transceiver, the storage device having a door or port to access inside the storage device and an RFID reader installed at entry of said port, wherein the data is variable information selected from the group consisting of content and characteristics of storage device and items, categories and subcategories that items and item content belong to, location of the storage device, position and coordinates of the item in the storage device, item, destination of the item, modification date, expiry date, date and time item was stored in, removed from or moved within the storage device, name of person storing item in, removing item from, manipulating item in, or moving item within the storage device, tracking number, identification number, patient name or ID number, place, origin, chronology and history of item or item content or item content creation, treatments and modifications that an item content or item content source or item content host were subjected to, contact coordinates, references and information on owner distributor or supplier, description of content, instructions name of mutation, type of mutation, category of mutation, name of disease, type of disease, category of disease, tumor name, any pathological condition, name of species, name of organism, name of organ, name of body part, name of tissue, and name of cell. 2. A method of determining variable information for an item comprising an RFID tag kept at a low or ultra-low temperature, comprising: (a) providing a low or ultra-low temperature storage device comprising an antenna for transmission of data between a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and an RFID tag transceiver wherein the storage device further comprises a port to access inside the storage device and an RFID reader installed at entry of said port; (b) programming the RFID tag with variable information whenever the item remains in, is put into, removed from or moved within the storage device; (c) reading the variable information so programmed; and (d) determining the variable information for the item based thereon; wherein the variable information is selected from the group consisting of content and characteristics of storage device and items, categories and subcategories that items and item content belong to, location of the storage device, position and coordinates of the item in the storage device, item, destination of the item modification date, expiry date, date and time item was stored in, removed from or moved within the storage device, name of person storing item in, removing item from, manipulating item in, or moving item within the storage device, tracking number, identification number, patient name or ID number place origin, chronology and history of item or item content or item content creation, treatments and modifications that an item content or item content source or item content host were subjected to, contact coordinates references and information on owner, distributor or supplier, description of content, instructions, name of mutation, type of mutation, category of mutation, name of disease, type of disease, category of disease, tumor name, any pathological condition, name of species, name of organism, name of organ, name of body part, name of tissue, and name of cell.
