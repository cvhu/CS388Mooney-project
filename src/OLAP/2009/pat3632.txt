The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises a DNA oligonucleotide. 3. The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises an RNA oligonucleotide. 4. The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises a chimeric antisense oligonucleotide. 5. The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety, or nucleobase. 6. The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 8. The composition of claim 1, wherein the antisense compound comprises at least one 5-methylcytosine. 9. The composition of claim 4, wherein the chimeric antisense oligonucleotide comprises a plurality of 2'-deoxynucleotides flanked on each side by at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl nucleotide. 10. A composition comprising a single-stranded antisense compound or a salt form thereof, wherein the single-stranded antisense compound is 15 to 30 nucleobases in length and is at least 90% complementary to at least 8 consecutive nucleobases within nucleobases 1104-1123 of SEQ ID NO:4, wherein the single-stranded antisense compound is a chimeric antisense oligonucleotide, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10, wherein the antisense compound comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety, or nucleobase. 12. The composition of claim 11, wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 13. The composition of claim 11, wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 14. The composition of claim 11, wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytidine. 15. The composition of claim 10, wherein the antisense compound comprises a plurality of 2'-deoxynucleotides flanked on each side by at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl nucleotide. 16.
