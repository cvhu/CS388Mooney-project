An acoustic detection and localization system includes a signal acquisition stage, a biomimetic processor, and an acoustic feature processor. The system uses multiple acoustic cues including spectral content, inter-aural time delay (ITD), inter-aural intensity difference (IID), and periodicity content to detect, classify, and localize sound sources. Pairs of acoustic sensors are arranged geometrically with a spacing depending on the application. The biomimetic processing provides for echo suppression to enhance performance in reverberant environments, and automatic gain controls for robustness in noisy environments. Applications include mobile robotic platforms for reconnaissance and surveillance, helmet mounted systems for sniper detection, vehicle-mounted systems for combat awareness, general civilian security systems, and systems for environmental monitoring and tracking of animals.
