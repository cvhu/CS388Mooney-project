A system for testing with an automated test equipment (ATE) includes a tester having at least one test resource, a tandem handler, and a mux relay that switchably connects the test resource, via parallel connections, to either one of dual sockets at each instant of testing. The handler has first and second manipulator arms. Each arm operates as to a particular one of the respective sockets, to retrieve a next device to be tested and position the device in the socket (while testing is performed on a device in the other socket), to disposition the device from the socket once testing is completed as to the device in the socket, and thereafter repeat until all staged devices for testing have been tested (or an interruption of testing otherwise occurs). The mux relay switches between sockets in response to the tandem handler acting as a master and the tester as slave. Upon completion of testing via the test resource as to an applicable pin of one socket, the test resource is switchably connected via the mux relay to a functionally same applicable pin of the other socket. The tandem handler controls the mux and test commencement by test result/end-of-test signals. The tandem handler logically and mechanically operates itself, the mux relay, and the tester logically and functionally for the dual socket arrangement. Control/master of the tester by the tandem handler allows for negligible index time and reduced downtime of testing. Certain handler elements, such as transports, stages, and so forth, are duplicated along dual test progression paths for respective sockets. Other elements, including logic and control, are common for the dual paths.
