The invention relates to the clinically intelligent design of diagnostic devices (such as microarrays) and methods of making and using such devices in differential diagnoses of specific clinical symptoms or sets of symptoms. In one aspect, the devices include various probes used to perform parallel screening of a number of analytes. The probes are clustered on the devices based on known clinical presentations of symptoms associated with specific diseases and disorders.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of determining the suitability of a therapeutic agent for treating at least one symptom for a condition in a subject, the method comprising the steps of: (a) applying a sample from a subject to multiplexed test comprising two or more clusters of a probe or set of probes, wherein the plurality of probes comprises (i) a first probe for a first target associated with a cause of the at least one symptom, and (ii) a second probe for a second target associated with at least one genetic sequence in a subject that makes the subject resistant, tolerant, intolerant or susceptible to the therapeutic agent; (b) detecting interactions, and (c) analyzing the interactions to determine a cause of the at least one symptom and to determine the suitability of the therapeutic agent to treat a cause of the condition. 2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least one genetic sequence is indicative of an activity selected from the group consisting of tolerance, resistance, intolerance, and susceptibility of the subject to a pathogen. 3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least one genetic sequence is indicative of an activity selected from the group consisting of tolerance resistance, intolerance, susceptibility and an idiosyncratic reaction of a target to the therapeutic agent.
