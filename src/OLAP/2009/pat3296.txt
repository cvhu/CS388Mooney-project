A method of morphological reconstruction of biological activity in a tissue sample maps biological data resulting from analysis of tissue samples onto a 3-D morphological rendering of the biological sample. Each slice in a set of histological slices, indexed by a first index, is micro dissected into micro samples indexed by a pair of first and second indices. The indices are utilized to spatially map biological data to the 3-D rendering.
