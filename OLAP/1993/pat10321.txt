Alignment of each of a plurality of depending first conductive members (16), in an array of orthogonal rows and columns on an article (12), with a corresponding second conductive member (18) arranged in a like array on a substrate (14), is accomplished by positioning the article in spaced relationship from the substrate. The arrays of first and second conductive members (16,18) are first angularly aligned by rotating the article (12) so that the offset between a first column of first and second conductive members on the article and substrate, respectively, as seen by a television camera (32) at a first end of the article and substrate is the same as the offset between a second column of first and second members on the article and substrate, respectively, at the other end thereof as seen by a second camera (30). Translational alignment of the arrays of first and second conductive members (16,18) is accomplished by displacing the substrate (14) so that the first and second conductive members in the first column on the article and substrate, respectively, are aligned at the same time that the first and second conductive members in the first row of first and second conductive members on the article and substrate, respectively, are aligned.
Claims We claim: 1. Apparatus for registering an article with a substrate such that each of a plurality of first conductive members depending from the article in an array of orthogonal rows and columns is aligned with a separate one of a plurality of second conductive members in a like array on the substrate, comprising: a substrate holder for holding the substrate; means for laterally translating the substrate holder along each of a pair of orthogonal axes; means for holding the article in spaced relationship from the substrate such that each one of said first conductive members is proximate to a corresponding one of said second conductive members; a first television camera trained at a first end of the article and substrate for capturing the image of at least a portion of a first column of said first and second conductive members, on the article and substrate, respectively, at a first end; a second television camera trained at a first side of the article and substrate orthogonal to the first end thereof for capturing the image of at least a portion of a first row of said first and second conductive members on the article and substrate, respectively; a mirror positioned proximate a second end of the article and the substrate, opposite the first end thereof, for reflecting an image of a portion of a second column of said first and second conductive members on the article and substrate, respectively, at said second end thereof; means for displacing the second camera along an axis parallel to the first side of the article for positioning the second camera at a location at which it can capture the image reflected by the mirror; a first monitor coupled to, for displaying the image captured by, the first camera; and a second monitor coupled to, for displaying the image captured by, the second camera. 2. The apparatus according to claim 1 further including means for displacing the first camera along an axis parallel to the first end of the article and the substrate. 3. The apparatus according to claim 2 wherein each of the first and second cameras includes a first means for illuminating its field of view with dark field illumination. 4. The apparatus according to claim 2 further including second means for illuminating the first side of the article and the substrate imaged by the second camera with dark field illumination.
