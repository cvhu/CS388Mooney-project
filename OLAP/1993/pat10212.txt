An improved, easily removable plug for plugging the open end of a heat exchanger tube in a nuclear steam generator is disclosed herein. The plug generally comprises a cylindrical shell of Inconel.RTM. having tapered side walls, a closed end, an open end, a cork-shaped expander element disposed within the shell that radially expands the tapered side walls of the shell into sealing engagement with the inner walls of a tube when axially drawn from the closed to the open end of the shell, and a wall section in the interior of the shell between the closed end and the tapered side walls for receiving the expander element when this element is pushed back from the open end of the shell back against the closed end thereof, thereby affording clear mechanical access to the interior of the tapered side walls of the shell. The improved plug is particularly adapted for use with a plug removal system that includes an expander remover that axially pushes the expander element backward against the closed end of the shell, a TIG torch for creating axially oriented weld beads within the interior of the tapered side walls of the shell in order to contract these side walls and to relax the engagement between the plug and the heat exchanger tube, and a plug puller that pulls the plug from the tube.
Claims We claim: 1. An improved plug for plugging a conduit of the type formed from a plug shell having a shell interior that has a closed end, an open end, and a tapered inner wall section having distal and proximal ends terminating in said closed and open ends, respectively, and an expander element initially located at the distal end of said tapered inner wall section adjacent to said closed end that expands the outer wall of the plug shell into engagement with the inner wall of the conduit when the expander element is drawn from the distal end of the tapered wall section to the proximal end of said section, wherein the improvement comprises an expander receiving cavity in the interior of the shell that is separate from the tapered wall section and disposed between the distal end of said section and the closed end of said shell for receiving the expander element when the element is pushed out of engagement with the tapered inner wall section, thereby affording clear mechanical access to the tapered wall section and facilitating the removal of the plug, wherein the portion of the walls of the plug shell that surround said cavity are not expanded when the expander element is moved within said walls for the first time. 2. An improved plug for plugging a tube of the type formed from a plug shell having a closed end and an open end, and a shell interior that includes a tapered wall section having distal and proximal ends terminating in said closed and open ends, respectively, and an expander element initially located at the distal end of said tapered wall section adjacent to said closed end that wedgingly coacts therewith to expand the outer wall of the shell into sealing engagement with the inner wall of the type when the expander elements is pulled from the closed to the open end thereof, wherein the improvement comprises an expander receiving cavity in the interior of the shell between the distal end of the tapered wall section and the closed end of the shell for receiving the expander element when the element is pushed back out of wedging engagement with the tapered wall section, and thereby affording clear mechanical access to the tapered wall section and facilitating the removal of the plug, wherein the portion of the walls of the plug shell that surround the cavity are not expanded when the expander element is moved within the walls of the cavity for the first time. 3. An improved plug for plugging a tube comprising: a plug shell having a closed end and an open end, and a shell interior that includes a tapered wall section having a proximal end that terminates at said open end of said shell, and a distal end; an expander element initially disposed within said shell interior at said distal end of said tapered wall section for expanding said tapered wall section by wedging engagement when said element is drawn from the distal to the proximal end of said wall section, and an expander receiving cavity disposed within said shell interior between the distal end of said tapered wall section and said closed end of said shell for receiving all of the expander element when the element is pushed out of wedging engagement with said tapered wall section incident to a plug removal operation to afford clear mechanical access to all of said tapered wall section, and a detent means for preventing the expander element from being inadvertently pushed up into said expander receiving cavity, said detent means being disposed between said tapered wall section and said expander receiving cavity and including a raised portion of the shell interior. 4. An improved plug for plugging a conduit, comprising: a plug shell having a closed end and an open end, and a shell interior that includes a tapered wall section having a proximal end that terminates at said open end of said shell, and a distal end that terminates within said shell; an expander element initially located at and surrounded by the distal end of said tapered wall section for radially expanding the plug shell when the expander element is moved from the distal to the proximal end of the tapered wall section, and a cavity within said shell for receiving the expander element upon removal of the plug shell from said conduit, said cavity being located between said closed end of said shell and the distal end of said tapered wall section, wherein said shell that surrounds said cavity is not radially expanded when said expander element is initially moved within the walls of said cavity. 5. An improved plug as defined in claim 4, further comprising a detent means disposed between the cavity and the distal end of said tapered wall section for preventing the expander element from being inadvertently pushed up into said expander receiving cavity. 6. An improved plug as defined in claim 5, wherein said detent means is an integrally formed, raised wall portion that is adjacent to the distal end of said tapered wall section.
