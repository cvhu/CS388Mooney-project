An apparatus for carrying out biochemical reactions in microtiter plates includes a device (42, 43) for receiving and holding microtiter plate (44) to be processed, the microtiter plate being provided with a plurality of wells and each well having a bottom outlet, and a movably mounted device (47) for the application of gas pressure to the wells of the microtiter plate (44), the pressure device including a sealing collar (48) and being movable between a position where it leaves the upper part of the microtiter plate accessible, and a position where it sealingly contacts the microtiter plate through the sealing collar (48) so that a gas pressure may be applied to the inlets of the microtiter plate wells for pressing out liquid present therein through the bottom outlet of each well.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for carrying out biochemical reactions in microtiter plates which comprises (a) a holder (42, 43) for receiving and holding a microtiter plate (35; 44) that is provided with a plurality of separate wells, each well having an inlet opening and a bottom outlet to expel liquid in the wells, and (b) a movably mounted device (5; 47) for applying gas pressure to the wells of said microtiter plate (35; 44), said gas pressure application device (5; 47) comprising a plate member (12) of at least the same length and width as said microtiter plate (35; 44), said plate member (12) having an inflatable collar (31; 48) of an elastic material around the periphery facing the periphery of said microtiter plate and being adapted to sealingly connect the gas pressure application device (5; 47) over the microtiter plate so as to thereby form a single gas application space (34; 50) defined by the microtiter plate (35; 44), the inflatable collar (31; 48) and the plate member (12; 47), whereby the same pressure will be quickly and simultaneously applied to the inlet openings of all wells.
