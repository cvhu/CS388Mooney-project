A rotating head mounts a nozzle which creates cavitation in a pressurized fluid such that a surface may be quickly and efficiently cleaned. The rotation of the nozzle ensures a relatively wide cleaning path. The cavitation allows cleaning using only the pressurized fluid jet without any necessary abrasives, while still fully utilizing high rotational speeds. A preferred cavitating jet nozzle is also disclosed for producing cavitation in the pressurized fluid. The cavitating jet nozzle includes a pin received at a central position which lowers the pressure of the pressurized fluid such that cavitation bubbles form in the fluid. The pin is self-centering within the nozzle since it is free floating relative to a securing member which retains the pin in the nozzle. In addition, the pin preferably has an end face upstream of an outlet portion of the nozzle.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of cleaning a surface comprising the steps of: supplying a pressurized fluid to an inlet of a nozzle and dispensing the fluid from an outlet of the nozzle, a bore extending between the inlet and the outlet; disposing a pin in the nozzle which creates cavitation in the pressurized fluid, the pin extending axially between two end portions and received in the bore, the first end portion retained within the bore adjacent the inlet to the nozzle, a second end portion extending from the first end portion towards the outlet of the nozzle, the pin being free-floating relative to the nozzle throughout its axial length such that the pin may be self-centering on a central axis of the bore throughout its axial length; directing the outlet of the nozzle onto a surface to be cleaned; rotating the nozzle about a rotational axis; and moving the nozzle along the surface to be cleaned. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein two nozzles are mounted in a single head which is rotated. 3. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the movement of the nozzle is along parallel lines in subsequent, opposite directions.
