A moving strain relief support arm, mounted on a machine frame, for a moving flexible coiled power or signal cable surrounding a reciprocating mandrel mounted on the machine frame and connecting to a tool mounted thereon for preventing friction and wear damage as the cable flexes, lengthens, and shortens around the moving mandrel.
Claims I claim: 1. A robotic machine tool comprising: (a) a frame; (b) a reciprocating mandrel attached to the frame; (c) a first stationary element attached to the mandrel; (d) a second stationary element of the frame adapted to receive a movably mounted shaped strain relief arm of said second stationary element; (e) a coil of cable attached at one end to said frame and at the opposite end to said first stationary element attached to said mandrel and coiling around but not contacting said mandrel; (f) a holder mounted on the opposite end of said shaped arm from the attachment to said frame for supporting said coil of cable; and (g) said holder having grooved means to support said coil of said cable. 2. A robotic machine tool as defined in claim 1, wherein said strain relief arm can be pivoted in its mounting on said machine. 3. A robotic machine tool as defined in claim 1, wherein said strain relief arm includes a bushing or a bearing. 4. A robotic machine tool as defined in claim 1, wherein said grooved means of said holder is lined with polytetrafluoroethylene.
