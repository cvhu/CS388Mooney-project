The method of claim 90, in which: the specimen has upper and lower surfaces and the lower surface is closer than the upper surface to the support surface when the specimen is placed on the proximal and distal pad specimen contacting surfaces; and the distal pad specimen contacting surface is inclined by an amount that results in substantially no contact between the distal pad specimen contacting surface and the lower surface of the specimen when the specimen contact mechanism urges the specimen so that the different portions of the peripheral edge press against the distal backstop and distal pad specimen contacting surfaces. 101. A specimen edge-gripping device that is adapted for operable coupling to a mechanism and gripping a specimen by its peripheral edge, the specimen having upper and lower surfaces, comprising: a body having a support surface, a proximal end, and a distal end; the support surface having near the distal end a distal pad portion for supporting the peripheral edge of the specimen and a distal backstop portion operatively associated with the distal pad portion, the distal pad portion having a distal pad specimen contacting surface, and the distal backstop portion having a height and a distal backstop specimen contacting surface of a shape that contributes to lateral center-positioning of the specimen when its peripheral edge is gripped; the support surface having near the proximal end a proximal pad portion for supporting the peripheral edge of the specimen the proximal pad portion having a proximal pad specimen contacting surface; and a specimen contact mechanism located nearer to the proximal end than to the distal end and actuatable between a specimen-releasing position and a specimen-securing position established by the peripheral edge of the specimen the specimen-releasing position providing sufficient clearance for placement of the specimen on the proximal and distal pad specimen contacting surfaces and the specimen-securing position urging the specimen placed on the proximal and the distal pad specimen contacting surfaces so that a portion of the peripheral edge presses against the distal backstop specimen contacting surface to grip the specimen by its peripheral edge, the height of the distal backstop portion ranging in size from substantially reaching to not extending substantially beyond the upper surface of the specimen when gripped. 102. The specimen edge-gripping device of claim 101, in which the distal pad specimen contacting surface is inclined in a direction relative to the support surface such that the peripheral edge of the specimen placed on the distal pad specimen contacting surface moves away from the support surface during actuation from the specimen-releasing position to the specimen-securing position. 103. The specimen edge-gripping device of claim 101, in which the specimen contact mechanism includes a proximal end contact point having a face portion that is inclined to impart to the specimen a motive force component directed toward the proximal pad specimen contacting surface. 104. The specimen edge-gripping device of claim 101, in which the specimen is made of a particular material and in which each of the distal pad specimen contacting surfaces is made of a material that restricts, to within acceptable limits for the particular specimen material, contamination generated as the peripheral edge of the specimen is urged to press the portion of the peripheral edge against the distal backstop and distal pad specimen contacting surfaces. 105. The specimen edge-gripping device of claim 104, in which the material of which each of the proximal and distal pad specimen contacting surfaces is made includes polyetheretherketone. 106. The specimen edge-gripping device of claim 101, in which the specimen contact mechanism comprises a specimen contact actuator that includes a biasing device and a force applying device, the biasing device applying a biasing force to urge the specimen contact mechanism to the specimen-securing position and the force applying device selectively overcoming the biasing force to urge the specimen contact mechanism, to the specimen-releasing position. 107. The specimen edge-gripping device of claim 101, in which the specimen contact mechanism comprises a specimen contact actuator that includes a biasing device applying a biasing force to cause the specimen contact mechanism to attain the specimen-securing position in event of loss of facilities to operate the specimen contact mechanism. 108. The method of claim 101, in which: the distal pad specimen contacting surface is inclined in a direction relative to the support surface such that the actuation from the specimen-releasing position to the specimen-securing position moves away from the support surface the peripheral edge of the specimen placed on the inclined distal pad specimen contacting surface; the specimen has upper and lower surfaces and the lower surface is closer than the upper surface to the support surface when the specimen is placed on the proximal and distal pad specimen contacting surfaces; and the distal pad specimen contacting surface is inclined by an amount that results in substantially no contact between the distal pad specimen contacting surface and the lower surface of the specimen when the specimen contact mechanism urges the specimen so that the portion of the peripheral edge presses against the distal backstop specimen contacting surface.
