A humanoid robot including upper limbs, lower limbs, and a trunk. Hip joints which connect the lower limbs and the trunk each possess degrees of freedom provided in correspondence with a hip joint yaw axis, a hip joint roll axis, and a hip joint pitch axis. The humanoid robot is a leg-movement-type robot which walks on two feet. By arbitrarily offsetting the hip joint yaw axes in a roll axis direction, the effects of the movement of the center of gravity occurring when the mode of use of the robot is changed are accommodated to in order to flexibly balance the weights of the upper and lower limbs. The waist is made more compact in order to form a humanoid robot which is well proportioned and which makes it possible to prevent interference between the left and right feet when the direction of a foot is changed. Accordingly, a robot which moves naturally and in a way sufficiently indicative of emotions and feelings using fewer degrees of freedom is provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A legged walking robot comprising: a trunk which has at least a trunk pitch axis and a trunk roll axis which intersect each other; lower limbs which are connected to the trunk; a hip joint means which connects the lower limbs and the trunk, said hip joint means having has at least a hip joint roll axis and a hip joint pitch axis which intersect each other; and wherein the hip joint pitch axis is offset rearwardly longitudinally from the trunk pitch axis in the direction of either of the trunk roll axis or the hip joint roll axis.
