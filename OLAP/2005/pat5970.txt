Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of CD36L1. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding CD36L1. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of CD36L1 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of CD36L1 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 336 through 363 of a coding region of a nucleic acid molecule encoding CD36L1 (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein said compound is an antisense oligonucleotide with at least one modified internucleoside linkage and specifically hybridizes with said region and inhibits the expression of CD36L1. 2. The compound of claim 1 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 3. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-o-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 5. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oiigonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 7. The compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 8. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 9. The composition of claim 8 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of CD36L1 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues In vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of CD36L1 is inhibited.
