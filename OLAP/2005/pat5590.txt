A method and arrangement for implementing post-heat treatment after spray forming is ended to achieve stress control in the manufacture of a spray formed metallic tool involves providing a spray-formed metallic tool by applying a spray-forming material on a mold substrate and causing substantially homogenous metallic phase transformations of the spray forming material within the spray-formed metallic tool to a substantially homogenous distribution of commingled metallic phases consisting, for example, of predetermined proportions of at least a bainite phase and a martinsite phase.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for implementing post-heat treatment after spray forming is ended to achieve stress control in the manufacture of a spray-formed metallic tool, comprising: providing a spray-formed metallic tool formed by application of a spray-forming material at a preselected application temperature upon a mold substrate having a pre-selected post-forming mold substrate temperature disposed within a spray-forming cell environment having a pre-selected post-forming spray forming cell environment temperature; causing preselected substantially homogenous metallic phase transformations of the spray forming material within the spray-formed metallic tool to a substantially homogenous distribution of commingled metallic phases consisting of predetermined proportions of at least a bainite phase and a martensite phase of the spray forming material; and wherein the substantially homogenous metallic phase transformations are caused at least in part via manipulation of at least one of the post-forming substrate temperature and the post-forming spray forming cell environment temperature. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein causing the metallic phase transformations further comprises causing substantially homogenous volumetric changes in the spray forming material within the spray-formed metallic tool associated at least in part with the metallic phase transformations of the spray forming material. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the manipulation of at least one of the substrate temperature and the spray forming cell environment temperature further comprises maintaining at least one of the mold substrate and the spray forming cell environment at the pre-selected post-forming temperature greater than a martinsite start temperature for the spray forming material for a predetermined time interval and thereafter decreasing the temperature of the at least one of the mold substrate and the spray forming cell environment to a second pre-selected post-forming temperature below the martinsite start temperature. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the manipulation of at least one of the substrate temperature and the spray forming cell environment temperature further comprises maintaining both the mold substrate and the spray forming cell environment at the pre-selected post-forming temperature greater than the martinsite start temperature for the spray forming material for the predetermined time interval and thereafter decreasing the temperature of both of the mold substrate and the spray forming cell environment to the second pre-selected post-forming temperature below the martinsite start temperature. 5. The method of claim 3, wherein the manipulation of at least one of the substrate temperature and the spray forming cell environment temperature further comprises maintaining the spray forming cell environment at the pre-selected post-forming temperature greater than the martinsite start temperature for the spray forming material for the predetermined time interval and thereafter decreasing the temperature of the spray forming cell environment to the second pre-selected post-forming temperature below the martinsite start temperature. 6. The method of claim 3, wherein the manipulation of at least one of the substrate temperature and the spray forming cell environment temperature further comprises maintaining the mold substrate at the pre-selected post-forming temperature greater than the martinsite start temperature for the spray forming material for the predetermined time interval and thereafter decreasing the temperature of the mold substrate to the second pre-selected post-forming temperature below the martinsite start temperature.
