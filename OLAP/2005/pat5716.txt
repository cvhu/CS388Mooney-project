This invention is an apparatus for imaging metrology, which in particular embodiments may be integrated with a processor station such that a metrology station is apart from but coupled to a process station. The metrology station is provided with a first imaging camera with a first field of view containing the measurement region. Alternate embodiments include a second imaging camera with a second field of view. Preferred embodiments comprise a broadband ultraviolet light source, although other embodiments may have a visible or near infrared light source of broad or narrow optical bandwidth. Embodiments including a broad bandwidth source typically include a spectrograph, or an imaging spectrograph. Particular embodiments may include curved, reflective optics or a measurement region wetted by a liquid. In a typical embodiment, the metrology station and the measurement region are configured to have 4 degrees of freedom of movement relative to each other.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for evaluating a predetermined region of a sample, said apparatus comprising: a solid state light source for illuminating the sample; a first camera for capturing a first image of the sample, illuminated by the solid state light source, in order to identify a location of the predetermined region to be measured; a second light source for illuminating the predetermined region; a detector for measuring light from the second light source that is reflected from the predetermined region; and a second camera for capturing a second image of the sample in order to identify the location of the predetermined region to be measured. 2. An apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the second camera has a smaller field of view than the first camera. 3. An apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the second camera captures a second image of the sample while the sample is illuminated by the second light source.
