A weld gun having a linkage, which relates pivotal motion of a pair of laterally opposed facing electrodes of the weld gun in a predetermined manner. Based upon the predetermined motion of the electrodes a welding robot positions the electrodes of the weld gun on opposite sides of a workpiece to be welded so that the electrodes simultaneously engage the workpiece on opposite sides.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A weld gun having a base, first and second arms supported on the base for pivotal motion about a common axis extending laterally between the arms, a pair of laterally opposed electrodes carried on the arms and engageable upon pivotable motion of the arms moving the electrodes toward one another to a closed position, and the improvement comprising: a lever supported on the base and pivotable on a second axis spaced longitudinally from the first axis, the lever having ends spaced in opposite directions from the second axis; the ends of the lever being connected one with each of the first and second arms; and an actuator connected to actuate at least one of the arms in a pivotal motion; whereby actuation of said one arm is operative to pivot the lever to oppositely actuate the second arm in a predetermined manner so that the arms move the electrodes toward and away from one another; and wherein at least one of said ends of the lever is connected with an associated one of the arms through a rod and the rod connects with a resilient member that compresses to allow limited variation of the electrode closed position. 2. A weld gun having a base, first and second arms supported on the base for pivotal motion about a common axis extending laterally between the arms, a pair of laterally opposed electrodes carried on the arms and engageable upon pivotable motion of the arms moving the electrodes toward one another to a closed position, and the improvement comprising: a lever supported on the base and pivotable on a second axis spaced longitudinally from the first axis, the lever having ends spaced in opposite directions from the second axis; the ends of the lever being connected one with each of the first and second arms; and an actuator connected to actuate at least one of the arms in a pivotal motion; whereby actuation of said one arm is operative to pivot the lever to oppositely actuate the second arm in a predetermined manner so that the arms move the electrodes toward and away from one another; and wherein two resilient members are connected between the lever and the first and second arms and are compressed to allowed limited variation of the electrode closed positions. 3. A weld gun having a base, first and second arms supported on the base for pivotal motion about a common axis extending laterally between the arms, a pair of laterally opposed electrodes carried on the arms and engageable upon pivotable motion of the arms moving the electrodes toward one another to a closed position, and the improvement comprising: a lever supported on the base and pivotable on a second axis spaced longitudinally from the first axis, the lever having ends spaced in opposite directions from the second axis; the ends of the lever being connected one with each of the first and second arms; and an actuator connected to actuate at least one of the arms in a pivotal motion; whereby actuation of said one arm is operative to pivot the lever to oppositely actuate the second arm in a predetermined manner so that the arms move the electrodes toward and away from one another; the weld gun including at least one resilient member, between the lever and an associated one of the arms, that compresses to allow limited variation of the electrode closed position. 4. A weld gun as in claim 1 wherein the resilient member is a spring. 5. A weld gun as in claim 1 wherein the resilient member is a rubber bushing.
