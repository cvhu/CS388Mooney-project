The present invention is directed to a robot compatible crystal worksite suite comprising a unique dewar, a plurality of magazines, a plurality of cryo-pins (that mount crystals to be transferred from the dewar for crystallography study) adapted to be placed into the magazines and a programmed controller to provide the operational sequence necessary to remove the frozen mounted crystals from the dewar to an instrument or a goniometer for the x-ray diffraction of the crystals.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A worksite system used in crystallography applications comprising: a dewar, the dewar further comprising a rim at an upper portion thereof and a heater disposed proximate said rim of said dewar; a plurality of magazines which may be placed in said dewar; each magazine having a plurality of cylinders, each cylinder adapted to hold a cryo-pin having a crystal mounted thereon; and a cryo-pin tong for removing said cryo-pin and positioning said crystal mounted on said pin in a goniometer. 2. A worksite system used in crystallography applications according to claim 1 wherein said dewar has a top that is adapted to be opened and closed. 3. A worksite system used in crystallography applications according to claim 2 wherein said top is adapted to be opened and closed by a programmed controller. 4. A worksite system used in crystallography applications according to claim 1 wherein said plurality of magazines are adapted to be placed in said dewar simultaneously. 5. A worksite system used in crystallography applications comprising: a dewar, the dewar further comprising a rim at an upper portion thereof and a heater disposed proximate said rim of said dewar; a programmed controller; and a top on said dewar that is opened and closed by said programmed controller.
