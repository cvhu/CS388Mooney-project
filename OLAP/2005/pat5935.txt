The present invention relates to the automated manufacture of frame components for window assemblies and the like. More particularly the invention includes: an automated apparatus for collating kits of frame components; an automated manufacturing system incorporating a collating device of this kind; and a frame components finishing operations station adapted for operation as part of the automated manufacturing system.
Claims We claim: 1. An automated manufacturing system for manufacturing kits of frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape from stock lengths of frame sections, said apparatus including: at least one frame component preparation line, wherein said at least one frame component preparation line includes a first cutting station adapted to cut said stock lengths of frame sections to predetermined cut lengths for forming into frame components and conveyor means to transfer cut frame sections to said collating station for grouping into kits; a collating station for grouping said frame components into kits, wherein said collating station comprises a collator for grouping finished frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape into kits, said collator including a frame component receiving station, a collator station defining a plurality of collating receptacles each adapted to receive a kit of said frame components, and first transfer means to selectively transfer each of said frame components from said receiving station to a predetermined one of said receptacles of said collating station; wherein the frame component receiving station and first transfer means are combined in the form of a programmable distributor conveyor that receives the finished frame components and then selectively deposits each of them into a predetermined one of the collator receptacles: wherein the distributor conveyor is oriented to receive and convey the finished frame components at an angle of approximately 15.degree. off the vertical, such that the side adjacent the preparation lines is inclined away from the preparation line to assist the step of receiving the finished components, and on the remote side is inclined toward the collator to assist release of the frame component into the collator receptacles. 2. An automated manufacturing system for manufacturing kits of frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape from stock lengths of frame sections, said apparatus including: at least one frame component preparation line, wherein said at least one frame component preparation line includes a first cutting station adapted to cut said stock lengths of frame sections to predetermined cut lengths for forming into frame components and conveyor means to transfer cut frame sections to said collating station for grouping into kits; a collating station for grouping said frame components into kits, wherein said collating station comprises a collator for grouping finished frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape into kits, said collator including a frame component receiving station, a collator station defining a plurality of collating receptacles each adapted to receive a kit of said frame components, and first transfer means to selectively transfer each of said frame components from said receiving station to a predetermined one of said receptacles of said collating station; wherein the collator station has thereon a plurality of collating bins each adapted to receive a set of frame components required to make up a kit for a particular frame; wherein the collating bins are in the form of pockets disposed in a generally vertical orientation for loading and unloading the frame components: wherein the transfer means include rollers to deflect a lower end of components toward the pocket and the pockets include an inclined component end guide plate to take the energy out of the component as it falls into the pocket. 3. An automated manufacturing system for manufacturing kits of frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape from stock lengths of frame sections, said apparatus including: at least one frame component preparation line, wherein said at least one frame component preparation line includes a first cutting station adapted to cut said stock lengths of frame sections to predetermined cut lengths for forming into frame components and conveyor means to transfer cut frame sections to said collating station for grouping into kits; a collating station for grouping said frame components into kits, wherein said collating station comprises a collator for grouping finished frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape into kits, said collator including a frame component receiving station, a collator station defining a plurality of collating receptacles each adapted to receive a kit of said frame components, and first transfer means to selectively transfer each of said frame components from said receiving station to a predetermined one of said receptacles of said collating station; wherein said collating station has thereon a plurality of collating bins each adapted to receive a set of frame components required to make up a kit for a particular frame; wherein the collating bins are in the form of pockets disposed in a generally vertical orientation for loading and unloading the frame components; wherein the pockets are in the form of sling holders which are optionally readily removable from the collator. 4. An automated manufacturing system for manufacturing kits of frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape from stock lengths of frame sections, said apparatus including; at least one frame component preparation line, wherein said at least one frame component preparation line includes a first cutting station adapted to cut said stock lengths of frame sections to predetermined cut lengths for forming into frame components and conveyor means to transfer cut frame sections to said collating station for grouping into kits; a collating station for grouping said frame components into kits, wherein said collating station comprises a collator for grouping finished frame components of varying lengths and cross sectional shape into kits, said collator including a frame component receiving station, a collator station defining a plurality of collating receptacles each adapted to receive a kit of said frame components, and first transfer means to selectively transfer each of said frame components from said receiving station to a predetermined one of said receptacles of said collating station; wherein said collating station has thereon a plurality of collating bins each adapted to receive a set of frame components required to make up a kit for a particular frame, wherein the collator is in the form of a carousel containing two sets of collating bins each in the form of a row of component receiving pockets, each row being mounted 180.degree. apart, the carousel being rotatable about an axis between said sets of pockets such that one set of pockets can be positioned for loading or receiving the frame components, while the other is positioned for unloading of the collated kits of components. 5. An automated manufacturing system according to claim 4 wherein each set of pockets is also mounted for horizontal movement toward each other prior to and for the rotation cycle.
