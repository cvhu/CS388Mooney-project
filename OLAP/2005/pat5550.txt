A direct clamp robotic finishing system is provided including a robot, a gripper secured to the robot, and a pair of fingers secured to the gripper. A tray assembly is also provided for supporting a plurality of implants for picking up by the fingers. An implant reorientation station is provided for supporting the implant being maneuvered by the robot as the robot re-grips the implant from a new direction. The fingers directly clamp the implant thereby eliminating the need for dedicated implant support bars.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A direct clamp tooling set for finishing a part with a robotic finishing system employing a robot having jaws, the tooling set comprising: a pair of opposed L-shaped fingers coupled to the jaw and having clam-shell shaped gripping surfaces adapted to grip at least one vertical projection of the part; a supply stand including chamfered support surfaces supporting the part at first preselected locations; and an implant reorientation station including chamfered support surfaces supporting the part at second preselected locations.
