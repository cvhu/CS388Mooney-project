An apparatus and a method for the exchange of power-supplied batteries which are arranged in a media-conveying untethered robot which is located in an automated data-storage library.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for exchanging rechargeable batteries in a media conveying robot located in an automated data-storage library; comprising: at least one battery-charging cell in said library for selectively storing charged batteries and for charging drained batteries; said robot containing at least one battery for supplying operating power to said robot; and first gripper structure on said robot for replacing said at least one battery in said robot upon being drained, and second gripper structure on said robot for retrieving a charged battery from said at least one battery charging cell in said library and conveying said charged battery to said robot. 2. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said library includes a plurality of said battery charging cells, said robot including at least two said battery gripper structures for simultaneous battery replacement operation. 3. An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said plurality of battery charging cells are arranged in mutually spaced relationship along the extent of said library to enable access thereto by said battery gripper structures at predetermined positions of said robot relative to said library. 4. An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein said battery-charging cells are spaced along the lower ends of spaced walls of said library, said robot being moveable between said walls and having said battery gripper structures mounted proximate to the lower end of said robot. 5. An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said robot is rotatable about a vertical axis to facilitate access by said battery gripper structures to said battery-charging cells at different angular and rotational orientations of said robot. 6. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first one of said battery gripper structure ejects a drained battery from said robot while said second one of said battery gripper structures simultaneously withdraws a charged battery from a battery-charging cell in said library. 7. An apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein said first one battery gripper structure conveys said drained battery into an empty said battery-charging cell for recharging said drained battery, said second battery gripper structure simultaneously positioning said charged battery in said robot to facilitate an uninterrupted supply of power to said robot for continuous operation thereof. 8. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said at least one battery comprises a sole battery energy source for said robot. 9. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said library comprises battery-charging stations in front of drives for charging drained batteries during periods of idling of said library. 10. A method of exchanging rechargeable batteries in a media conveying robot located in an automated data-storage libraiy, said method comprising: providing at least one battery-charging cell in said library for selectively storing charged batteries and for charging drained batteries; equipping said robot with at least one battery for supplying operating power to said robot; and providing first gripper structure on said robot for replacing said at least one battery in said robot upon being drained, and second gripper structure on said robot for retrieving a charged battery from said at least one battery charging cell in said library and conveying said charged batter to said robot. 11. A method claimed in claim 10, wherein said library includes a plurality of said battery-charging cells, said robot including at least two said battery gripper structures for simultaneous battery replacement operation. 12. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein said plurality of battery charging cells are arranged in mutually spaced relationship along the extent of said library to enable access thereto by said battery gripper structures at predetermined positions of said robot relative to said library. 13. A method as claimed in claim 12, wherein said battery charging cells are spaced along the lower ends of spaced walls of said library, said robot being moveable between said walls and having said battery gripper structures mounted proximate to the lower end of said robot. 14. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein said robot is rotatable about a vertical axis to facilitate access by said battery gripper structures to said battery charging cells at different angular and rotational orientations of said robot. 15. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein a first one of said battery gripper structures ejects a drained battery from said robot while said second one of said battery gripper structures simultaneously withdraws a charged battery from a battery charging cell in said library. 16. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein said first one battery gripper structure conveys said drained battery into an empty said battery charging cell for recharging said drained battery, said second battery gripper structure simultaneously positioning said charged battery in said robot to facilitate an uninterrupted supply of power to said robot for continuous operation thereof. 17. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein said at least one battery comprises a sole battery energy source for said robot. 18. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein battery-charging stations in front of drives of said library charge drained batteries during periods of idling of said library. 19. An automated data-storage library incorporating an apparatus for exchanging rechargeable batteries in a media conveying robot located in said automated data-storage library; comprising: at least one battery-charging cell in said library for selectively storing charged batteries and for charging drained batteries; said robot containing at least one battery for supplying operating power to said robot; and first gripper structure on said robot for replacing said at least one battery in said robot upon being drained, and a second gripper structure for retrieving a charged battery from said at least one battery charging cell in said library and conveying said charged battery to said robot.
