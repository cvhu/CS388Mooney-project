A fugitive pattern of an article to be investment cast wherein the pattern includes a plurality of locator embossments disposed in an array to provide a datum reference system by which the pattern can be held and positioned by a manipulator, such as for example a gripper device to a computer controlled robotic device, for assembly with another component of the pattern assembly. The datum embossments are located on a portion of the pattern that will be removed from the final metallic casting made to replicate the pattern. The casting includes integral cast datum embossments thereon by which the casting can be held and positioned.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a method of making a fugitive pattern assembly where a fugitive pattern is attached to a surface area of a fugitive support member, the improvement comprising the steps of determining a planar orientation of said surface area on said fugitive support member, orienting said pattern such that a pattern attaching surface of said fugitive pattern has the same planar orientation as that of said surface area, and attaching said attaching surface of said fugitive pattern to said surface area with said pattern attaching surface having the same planar orientation as that of said surface area during said attachment. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said planar orientation is determined by measuring distances between a pattern gripper device and multiple points on said surface area. 3. The method of claim 1 including orienting said pattern using a robotic arm having a gripper device that grips a plurality of locators on said pattern, said locators defining a pattern reference plane.
