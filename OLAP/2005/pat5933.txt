An end effector for a robot is used to unpack flattened stackable items from a container using a fixed sized vacuum plenum and simple adjustable gripping elements. The gripping elements comprise a pair of adjustable, smooth blades. In addition, the end effector includes mechanisms for retaining and transporting the container.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An end effector for a robot, comprising: a plate mounted to the robot, said plate having a first surface and an oppositely positioned second surface; a vacuum port located on the first surface of the plate and passing through the plate to the second surface, said vacuum port being connected to a vacuum source; a surround located on the second surface of the plate, said surround enveloping the vacuum port at the second surface of the plate, said surround comprises a subframe, said subframe located between the surround and the plate; a first gripping element mounted to the second surface in substantially perpendicular relationship to the plate, said first gripping element being located outboard the surround; a second gripping element positioned in spaced parallel relation opposite the first gripping element whereby said second gripping element is located outboard the surround. 2. An end effector for a robot, comprising: a plate mounted to the robot, said plate having a first surface and an oppositely positioned second surface; a vacuum port located on the first surface of the plate and passing through the plate to the second surface, said vacuum port being connected to a vacuum source; a surround located on the second surface of the plate, said surround enveloping the vacuum port at the second surface of the plate; a first gripping element mounted to the surface in substantially perpendicular relationship to the plate, said first gripping element being located outboard the surround; a second gripping element positioned in spaced parallel relation opposite the first gripping element whereby said second gripping element is located outboard the surround; a pair of parallel mounting rails positioned substantially perpendicular to the plate, each of said parallel mounting rails having a plurality of vacuum cups mounted thereon whereby said vacuum cups are adapted to selectively apply a vacuum. 3. An end effector for a robot, comprising: a plate mounted to said end effector, said plate having a first surface and an oppositely positioned second surface; a vacuum port located on the first surface of the plate and passing through the plate to the second surface, said vacuum port being connected to a vacuum source; a surround located on the second surface of the plate, said surround enveloping the vacuum port at the second surface of the plate; a first gripping element mounted to the second surface in substantially perpendicular relationship to the plate, said first gripping element being located outboard the surround; a second gripping element positioned in space parallel relation opposite the first gripping element whereby said second gripping element is located outboard the surround; and a plurality of piercing points, said points being retractably mounted to the plate. 4. An end effector according to claim 3 further comprising a plurality of suction cups located on said plate, and wherein said plate is mounted in substantial perpendicular relationship to the end effector; and wherein said suction cups on said plate have means for drawing vacuum. 5. An end effector for a robot for manipulating a container, said effector comprising: a vacuum plenum comprising a mounting plate, a surround mounted to said plate, a port passing through said plate, and a means for drawing vacuum connected to said port; a first gripping element mounted to the plate outboard of said surround, said first gripping element comprising a stationary blade having a smooth surface, said stationary blade being rigidly mounted generally perpendicularly to the plate; and a second gripping element comprising a movable blade having a smooth surface, said movable blade being movably mounted generally perpendicular to the plate outboard of said surround, and wherein said movable blade is positioned opposite the first gripping element; and a plurality of piercing points, each said point having a barbed portion, said points being retractably mounted to the plate, whereby the plurality of points are adapted to pierce a container.
