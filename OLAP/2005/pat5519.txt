The invention provides novel polynucleotides isolated from cDNA libraries of human fetal liver-spleen and fetal liver as well as polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides. The polypeptide is a human chemokine receptor that is a member of a family of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains. Other aspects of the invention include vectors containing polynucleotides of the invention and related host cells as well a processes for producing chemokine receptor polypeptides, and antibodies specific for such polypeptides.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. 2. An isolated polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. 3. A method for detecting the presence of a compound that binds to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 3, comprising contacting a compound with the polypeptide, and detecting the complex comprising said compound and said polypeptide, wherein detection of the complex indicates identification of a compound that binds to the polypeptide. 4. A method of identifying a compound that binds to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 3, the method comprising providing a cell expressing SEQ ID NO: 3; contacting the cell with a test compound; and determining whether the test compound binds to SEQ ID NO: 3.
