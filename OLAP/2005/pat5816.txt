A medical system that allows a medical device to be controlled by one of two input devices. The input devices may be consoles that contain handles and a screen. The medical devices may include robotic arms and instruments used to perform a medical procedure. The system may include an arbitrator that determines which console has priority to control one or more of the robotic arms/instruments.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for controlling a medical device, comprising: controlling a first medical device with a first input device; and, controlling the first medical device with a second input device; and, comparing a priority associated with the first input device with a priority associated with the second input device to determine whether the first input device or the second input device should control the first medical device. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising a second medical device that includes a robotic arm that controls an endoscope coupled to a camera, said first medical device including a robotic arm, wherein robotic data from the robotic arms is multiplexed with video data from the camera onto a transmission link. 3. A method for controlling a medical instrument, comprising: receiving a command to control a robotically controlled medical instrument; and, transmitting a packet of information to the robotically controlled medical instrument, wherein the packet includes a priority field and a data field that contains robotic data. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the data field also contains RS232 data.
