Devices for monitoring, calibrating and maintaining a manufacturing robot. The first device comprises a reference pin mounted to a first member and a reference aperture located on a second adjacent member wherein the reference pin is inserted into the reference aperture when the two members are at their zero reference location. A second device checks tip alignment by periodically passing the welding tip of a welding torch through a V-shaped notch in a gauging block. The gauging block is electrically conductive and if the tip contacts the sidewalls of the V-shaped notch an electrical circuit is completed signalling the robot controller of tip misalignment. A third device comprises a shielding gas monitor having a closed tube to which the welding torch is applied for expelling shielding gas into the tube. The tube is in fluid communication with a flow gauge that measures gas flow and signals the controller if gas flow is insufficient.
Claims We claim: 1. A monitor for determining the flow of shielding gas from a welding robot, the welding robot is provided with a welding torch having shielding gas nozzles mounted thereon, the monitor comprising: a closed tube into which the shielding gas nozzles can be inserted; a gas flow gauge in fluid communication with the closed tube for measuring the flow of gas from the shielding gas nozzles; and means for signalling the robot when the gas flow as measured by the gas flow gauge is insufficient. 2. A monitor as defined by claim 1 wherein a calibrating throttle is positioned between the gas flow gauge and the tube for calibrating the gas flow gauge. 3. A monitor as defined by claim 2 wherein tube is provided with a removable debris trap.
