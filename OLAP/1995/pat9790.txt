An integrated circuit package is disclosed, of the type having a pin-fin heat sink attached to the surface. A flat plate is attached to the ends of the pins of the heat sink, to provide a planar surface area of adequate size to allow a vacuum pickup tool to pick and place the packaged integrated circuit, and to receive marking and symbolization.
Claims I claim: 1. A packaged integrated circuit, comprising: an integrated circuit package, containing an integrated circuit chip, and having a flat surface; a heat sink attached to the flat surface of the integrated circuit package, said heat sink having a plurality of extensions extending away from the integrated circuit package; and a plate, attached to the ends of the extensions, and having a flat surface that is substantially parallel with the flat surface of the integrated circuit package, wherein the flat surface of the plate has an area that is substantially smaller than the area of the flat surface of the integrated circuit package. 2. The integrated circuit of claim 1, further comprising: means for attaching the plate to the ends of the extensions. 3. The integrated circuit of claim 2, wherein the attaching means comprises a thermally conductive epoxy. 4. The integrated circuit of claim 1, wherein the plate is formed integrally with the heat sink. 5. The integrated circuit of claim 1, wherein the integrated circuit package is of the pin-grid-array type. 6. The integrated circuit of claim 1, wherein the integrated circuit package is of the ball-grid-array type. 7. The integrated circuit of claim 1, further comprising: marking on the flat surface of said plate.
