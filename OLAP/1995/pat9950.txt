First and second devices, such as a laser (11) and an optical fiber (12), are aligned by first positioning the laser on an x-y-z table (13) (such a table is capable of responding to electrical signals to make precise movements in mutually orthogonal x,y and z directions). The laser beam is imaged onto a machine vision camera (19) which develops signals representing the image of the laser beam and directs them to a computer (16). The computer analyzes the signal, calculates the center of the image, and determines from such calculation any deviations in the x and y directions of the position of the laser from its desired alignment position. Next, the optical fiber (12) is imaged on a machine vision camera (17). Signals from the camera representative of the image of the optical fiber end are directed to the computer (16) which calculates the center of the image and determines any deviation from its desired position. Finally, the x-y-z table is moved such that the laser is in approximate alignment with the optical fiber end, and signals from the computer are used to make fine adjustments of the position of the x-y-z table to compensate for the deviations of the laser from its assigned position and deviations of the optical fiber end from its assigned position.
