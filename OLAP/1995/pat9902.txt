A tube loading assembly for use in loading a tube on a flexible mandrel of a tube bending machine; said assembly comprising mandrel receiving means for receiving said mandrel; mandrel alignment means for aligning said received mandrel to be co-axial with said tube; and means for feeding said tube on said co-axially aligned mandrel. The assembly is of use with tubes to be bent for use in automotive exhaust systems, heat exchangers and aircraft hydraulic systems, and provides for improved automatic loading speeds.
Claims We claim: 1. A tube loading assembly for use in loading a tube on a flexible mandrel of a tube bending machine; said assembly comprising mandrel receiving means for receiving said mandrel; mandrel alignment means for aligning said received mandrel to be co-axial with said tube; and means for feeding said tube on said co-axially aligned mandrel. 2. A tube loading assembly for use in loading a tube on a flexible mandrel of a tube bending machine; said assembly comprising mandrel embracing jaw members; jaw actuating means cooperable with said jaw members to operably open said jaw members to receive said mandrel and to close said jaw members to effect axial alignment of said mandrel with said tube within said closed jaw members; and means for feeding said tube on said mandrel in said closed jaw members. 3. A tube loading assembly as claimed in claim 2 wherein said jaw actuating means comprises a first bias means-loaded pivotable scissor assembly and a second bias means-loaded pivotable scissor assembly cooperable with said jaw members to effect opening and closing of said jaw members. 4. A tube loading assembly as claimed in claim 3 wherein said bias means comprises coil spring means. 5. A tube loading assembly as claimed in claim 3 wherein said bias means are operably actuated by said tube feeding means.
