A specimen carrier for transporting conventional specimen tubes throughout an automatic laboratory conveyance system includes a generally rectilinear carrier body with a forward face having an identification zone delimited thereon. An identification code is marked in the identification zone so as to permit mechanical sensing and identification of the carrier on a conveyor system. A plurality of holes of various diameters and depths are provided in the top surface of the carrier to receive conventional specimen tubes of various types with the top ends of the specimen tubes located at a predetermined height above the top surface of the carrier.
Claims I claim: 1. In combination: a plurality of specimen carriers for transporting a laboratory specimen carried within a specimen tube, each specimen carrier comprising: a carrier body having a forward face, rearward face, top surface, bottom surface, right end wall and left end wall; specimen tube carrying means on said carrier body for carrying at least one specimen tube in a generally upright position and with the upper end of the specimen tube located a predetermined height above the top surface of said carrier body; and a first half of cooperable means for retaining said specimen carrier at a predetermined location on a storage rack, on the bottom surface of said specimen carrier; and each of said specimen carriers being independently and removably retained on a storage rack; said storage rack supporting a plurality of specimen carriers at predetermined locations, comprising: a generally planar base plate having an upper surface; and a second half of said cooperable means for retaining said plurality of specimen carriers on the upper surface of said base plate; said first half of said cooperable means including a generally vertical aperture formed in the bottom surface of each said specimen carrier body, and said second half of said cooperable means including a plurality of pins projecting upwardly from said base plate upper surface having dimensions to permit removable receipt within said carrier body apertures, such that each carrier body is individually and independently removable from said storage rack; said cooperable means on said specimen carriers and rack permitting independent removal of each specimen carrier from the rack. 2. In combination: a conveyor, including: an elongated conveyor track with an operable transport surface for moving a body supported thereon in a longitudinal direction; and forward and rearward spaced apart and parallel guide rails connected to said track and extending longitudinally therealong for guiding a body located between the guide rails and supported on the transport surface; and a specimen carrier transported on said conveyor, comprising: a carrier body having a forward face, rearward face, top surface, bottom surface, right end wall and left end wall; said forward face having an identification zone delimited by a lower boundary spaced a predetermined distance above the bottom surface of the carrier body; identification code means on said forward face within said identification zone, identifying the specimen carried by the carrier body; and specimen tube carrying means on said carrier body for carrying at least one specimen tube in a generally upright position and with the upper end of the specimen tube located a predetermined height above the top surface of said carrier body; said carrier body having a depth, as measured between the forward and rearward faces less than the distance between said guide rails, to permit free movement of the carrier body longitudinally on the track transport surface; said carrier body oriented on said conveyor track with the forward and rearward faces generally parallel and adjacent the forward and rearward guide rails; a selectively extendible arm operably mounted on said track for selected movement between an extended position, extending transversely across the longitudinal axis of the track and spaced a predetermined distance above the track transport surface, to engage a portion of the left end wall to prevent longitudinal movement and a retracted position permitting longitudinal movement of said specimen carrier on the track; and said carrier body having a notch formed in the left end wall and extending from the forward face to the rearward face, having dimensions to receive said arm therein such that said arm does not project outwardly beyond the left end wall when extended through said notch.
