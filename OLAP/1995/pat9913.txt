This invention relates to an improved automatic processing system and process for handling delicate objects in a controlled, low particulate atmosphere, and an improved method for constructing such apparatus. This system is particularly useful in the wet processing of semiconductor wafers, integrated circuits and similar delicate electronic devices. This invention also relates to semiconductor wafers, integrated circuits and similar delicate electronic devices produced by the above processing system and process.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a device for wet-processing of integrated circuits and delicate electronic components and devices, said device comprising a robotic arm having a driving mechanism having moving surfaces in contact with each other and having means to grip or otherwise hold individual and groups of integrated circuits and delicate electronic devices while being processed, means for filtering air and means for the addition and removal of said integrated circuits and delicate electronic devices into and out of processing stations, the improvement comprising a generally circular multi-modular device containing substantially identical wet-processing baths located around said robotic arm and the driving mechanism for said robotic arm is enclosed in a cover whereby the moving surfaces of said arm that are in contact with each other are isolated from the atmosphere surrounding the wet-processing baths. 2. A device constructed as in claim 1 which includes 6 modules. 3. A device constructed as in claim 1 which includes 8 modules. 4. A device constructed as in claim 1 wherein said modules do not form a complete circle. 5. A series of two or more of the devices of Claim 1 connected so that items may be passed from the robot arm of one multi-modular device to the robot arm of another multi-modular device. 6. Device of claim 1 including means to exhaust air from within said cover.
