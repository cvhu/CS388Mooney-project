An alignment system for a robotic gun assembly comprising a dual-keyed alignment system having a gun mounting arm comprising a keyway with a positive stop that corresponds to a key on the gun housing, and a second keyway with a positive stop within the gun housing that corresponds to a key on the robotic gooseneck.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An alignment system for a robotic gun assembly, said robotic gun assembly comprising a gun mount arm, a gun housing and a gooseneck; said gun mount arm having a through aperture having a wide bearing surface for receiving the gun housing; said wide bearing surface comprising a first elongated keyway and a first positive stop; said gun housing having an outer surface and comprising a first elongated key on the outer surface adaptable for engaging in the first elongated keyway, connector fittings enclosed within the housing and a locking thumb screw, said connector fittings comprising a second elongated keyway and a second positive stop, wherein the connector fittings have a frusto-cylindrical aperture axially drilled partially through said fittings, and a stainless steel insert press-fitted into the frusto-cylindrical aperture; said stainless steel insert having a notch defining the second elongated keyway, said gooseneck comprising a second key adaptable for engaging in the second elongated keyway, whereby the gun housing is slidingly received in the gun mount arm wherein the first elongated key slides into the first keyway thereby abutting to the first positive stop and the gooseneck is slidingly received into the gun housing wherein the second elongated key slides into the second keyway, thereby abutting to the second positive stop; wherein the locking thumb screw lockingly secures the gooseneck within the gun housing.
