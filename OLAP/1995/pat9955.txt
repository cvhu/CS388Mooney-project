A pressurized interface apparatus (200) is provided for transferring a workpiece from within a pressurized sealable transportable container (100) into a specified environment and vice versa. The container consists of a box-shaped housing (102) having an access opening (104) sealed by a releasable door (124) and having a gas injection valve (129). The interface apparatus includes an IN/OUT section having a box-shaped frame (201) with a port zone defining an interior space (204) provided with a first opening (205A) and a second opening (205'A) opposite thereto and communicating with the specified environment. The apparatus further includes a lid controlled by a drive (209A) to seal the first opening and cause the port zone to operate as a load lock chamber. A transfer handler (216A) having a workpiece gripper (218A) is mounted within the port zone. A container receiver is positioned in front of the first opening for receiving a container in a waiting position or in a working position adjacent the first opening. A clamping/actuating device (225a and b) clamps and moves the container between the working and waiting positions.
Claims We claim: 1. A pressurized interface apparatus (200) for transferring a workpiece to be processed from within a pressurized sealable transportable container (100) of the type consisting of a box-shaped housing (102) provided with an access opening (104) sealed by releasable door means (124) and gas injection valve means (129) into a specified environment and vice versa; said interface apparatus comprising a first section comprising: a box-shaped frame (201) comprising a port zone defining an interior space (204) provided with a first opening (205A) and a second opening (205'A) opposite to said first opening and communicating with said specified environment; lid means (214A) controlled by drive means (209A) sealing said first opening thereby causing the port zone to operate as a loadlock chamber; transfer handler means (216A) provided with workpiece gripping means (218A) mounted in said port zone; container receiving means (221A) in front of said first opening for receiving a container either in a first waiting position or in a second working position adjacent to said first opening; clamping/actuating means (225a and b) for clamping and moving the container from said first position to said second position and vice versa. 2. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said specified environment is a processing chamber (500). 3. The interface apparatus of claim 2 wherein said port zone is pressurized via one of the second opening and the processing chamber. 4. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said port zone is pressurized via gas injection valve means (245) connected to a compressed ultra pure neutral gas supply installation (700). 5. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said clamping/actuating means further comprises gas supply means and gas injector means (229a) connected to said gas supply means. 6. The interface apparatus of claim 4 wherein said gas supply installation includes means adapted to establish a first or nominal pressure p within said container and within said port zone to maintain a positive differential pressure .DELTA.p therein with respect to the outside ambient. 7. The interface apparatus of claim 6 wherein said positive differential pressure .DELTA.p ranges from 500 to 10000 Pa. 8. The interface apparatus of claim 4 wherein said gas supply installation further includes means to establish a second or blower pressure P calibrated to generate an adequate gas flow rate V for producing an efficient gas curtain at lid opening. 9. The interface apparatus of claim 8 wherein said flow rate V ranges from 0.2 to 2 m/s. 10. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said container receiving means further comprises positioning/centering means (222) for proper guiding of the container. 11. The interface apparatus of claim 1 further comprising opening means (207) for automatic release of said releasable door means when said container moves from said first to said second position. 12. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said drive means are outside the housing. 13. The interface apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a second IN/OUT section identical to said first IN/OUT section. 14. The interface apparatus of claim 13 wherein the common interior space (204) of said first and second IN/OUT sections is divided into two independent interior spaces. 15. The interface apparatus of claim 13 further comprising a container transfer device (233) for moving the container from the IN section first position to the OUT section first position. 16. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said specified environment is another container. 17. The interface apparatus of claim 16 wherein said another container is of the multiple wafer type (100'). 18. The interface apparatus of claim 17 wherein said container is of the multiple wafer type (100") provided with a standard cassette (151) and the transfer handler means are adapted to grip said cassette. 19. The interface apparatus of claim 1 wherein said workpiece is a silicon wafer.
