The dispatching apparatus with a gas supply distribution system (300) basically comprises an automatic handler 301 and a vertical stocker (302). The vertical stocker has a frame (308) formed by an assembly of tubes supporting a plurality of support stations or bins (309) each provided with gas infectors (311) connected on the one hand to the gas injection valves of the container and on the other hand to a compressed ultra pure neutral gas supply installation. As a result, during the processing idle times, an adequate overpressure of said neutral gas is maintained in the interior space of the container enclosing the workpiece, e.g. a silicon wafer. The automatic handler (301) basically comprises a handling robot (305) having an extending arm (306) provided with gripping means (307) adapted to the container design. The handling robot (305) is affixed on an elevator (304) for vertical movement and is able to rotate about it. The automatic handler (301) is adapted to transfer of containers (100) between the vertical stocker and conventional conveyors ( 401, 402) or between the conveyors themselves.
Claims We claim: 1. A dispatching apparatus (300) with a gas supply distribution system for handling and storing a plurality of pressurized sealable transportable containers (100) of the type consisting of a box-shaped housing (102) provided with an access opening (104) sealed by releasable door means (124) and gas injection valve means (129) including: an automatic handler (301) comprising: a base member with a rotatable head (303); an elevator arm (304) fixed thereon; a handling robot (305) affixed on said elevator comprising an extension arm (306) and container gripping means (307); and, a vertical stocker (302) comprising: a frame (308) formed by a plurality of hollow vertical tubes, said frame having a plurality of support stations or bins (309) attached thereon; wherein each bin is provided with gas injector means (311) connected on the one hand, to said gas injection valve means and on the other hand to a compressed ultra pure neutral gas supply installation (700) for maintaining a positive differential pressure .DELTA.p within the container with respect to the outside ambient during the storage time wherein said hollow vertical tubes are used for gas transportation. 2. The dispatching apparatus of claim 1 wherein said plurality of hollow vertical tubes are assembled in a circle configuration centered about an axis passing by the rotable head to produce a tower-shaped configuration. 3. The dispatching apparatus of claim 1 wherein said plurality of hollow vertical tubes are assembled in a linear direction to produce a wall-shaped configuration. 4. The dispatching apparatus of claim 3 wherein the rotable head is moving along a rectilinear track (325). 5. The dispatching apparatus of claim 1 wherein each of said bins consists of a support plate (310) having said gas injector means (311) fixed thereon. 6. The dispatching apparatus of claim 5 wherein said gas injector means comprises a jack (313) actuating a retractable nozzle (312). 7. The dispatching apparatus of claim 6 wherein said gas injector means operates in a first mode, when the nozzle is extended into the container gas injection valve means, the connection to the gas supply installation is thereby achieved, and conversely in a second mode when the nozzle is retracted, and the connection is thereby cut-off. 8. The dispatching apparatus of claim 1 wherein said gas injector means are adapted to establish a positive differential pressure .DELTA.p approximately in the 500-10 000 Pa range within the container. 9. The dispatching apparatus of claim 8 wherein said differential pressure .DELTA.p equals about 5 000 Pa.
