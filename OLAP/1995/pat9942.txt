A fully automated and computerized conveyor based manufacturing line architecture (15) is provided for the storage, handling and transportation of articles by processing equipment (500). The articles are stored in a pressurized sealable transportable container (100) which are transported by the conveyor (401-1). A gas supply (700-1) and delivery system (702-1) cooperate with a dispatching apparatus with a gas distribution system (300-1) to feed compressed ultra pure neutral gas to the containers. A pressurized interface apparatus (201-1) is adapted to receive the containers and transfer the articles enclosed therein to the processing equipment. The convenyor, dispatching apparatus, gas supply, interface and processing equipment are all computer controlled.
Claims We claim: 1. Fully automated and computerized conveyor based manufacturing line architecture (15) for the storage, handling and transporting of articles for the treatment thereof in a plurality of processors (500); said manufacturing line being installed in an average cleanliness ambient including: a) pressurized sealable transportable containers (100) of the type comprising a box-shaped housing (102) provided with an access opening (104) sealed with releasable door means (124) and gas injection valve means (129) enclosing a workpiece therein; b) conveyor transportation means (401-1); c) a gas supply installation means (700-1) comprising a compressed ultra pure neutral gas supply source (701-1) and a delivery system (702-1); d) dispatching apparatus means with a gas distribution system (300-1) comprising: storage/gas feeding means (302-1) for storing the containers said storage/gas feeding means comprising a frame supporting a number of support stations, each support station being provided with gas injector means connected to said gas supply installation means (700-1); handling means (301-1) for transferring said containers between said support stations and said conveyor transportation means; e) pressurized interface apparatus means (201-1) adapted to receive said containers and transfer the workpiece enclosed therein to a processing equipment (500-1) comprising: container receiving means for receiving/sending a container from/to said conveyor transportation means; a pressurized port zone provided with transfer robot means interfacing said container receiving means with said processing equipment; actuator means for moving said container on said container receiving means; and, f) computer means (600) for overall control of said conveyor transportation means, dispatching apparatus means, gas supply installation means, interface apparatus means and said processing equipments. 2. The manufacturing line of claim 1 wherein said conveyor transportation means (401-1) is an intra-bay conveyor servicing a plurality of pressurized interface apparatus (201-1, . . . ) fitted with corresponding processors (501-1, ; . . . ) in a process area (10-1, . . . ) with associated dispatching apparatus. 3. The manufacturing line of claim 2 wherein said conveyor transportation means further includes by-pass stations (401A-1, . . . ) to interface the conveyor transportation means with said interface apparatus and said dispatching apparatus. 4. The manufacturing line of claim 2 or 3 further including an extra-bay conveyor (402) for servicing a plurality of process areas ( 10-1, . . . , 10-N) through respective associated dispatching apparatus (300-1, . . . 300-N). 5. The manufacturing line of any claim 2 to 4 further including an input/output dispatching apparatus (300-I/O) for buffer purposes.
