The present invention comprises a robotic gripping hand capable of holding multiple storage media cartridges for retrieving and depositing cartridges within a storage library subsystem. The invention comprises a method and apparatus for indexing a tray adapted to hold multiple storage cartridges. The tray is attached to the robotic hand to enable the hand to select among several cartridges to be manipulated by a single gripper subassembly. The gripper subassembly may retrieve a cartridge from a storage library subsystem and insert it into an available position in the indexing tray without affecting other cartridges already retained in other positions of the indexing tray. Likewise the gripper may remove a cartridge from a position in the indexing tray and return it to the storage library subsystem without affecting other cartridge already retained in other positions of the indexing tray. The invention further comprises the use of beveled perpendicular opposing gears and "one-way" ratcheting clutches to permit a single drive motor to control the motion to index the tray as well as the motion of the gripper subassembly to extend forward and backward to retrieve or deposit storage cartridges. Turning the drive motor in one direction controls the extension motion without affecting the position of the indexing tray. Turning the drive motor in the opposite direction moves the indexing tray without affecting the position of the gripper subassembly.
