A system for robotic control of an object having x, y and z axis translational movement and C and D axis rotational movement capability. The object, which may be a robotic element such as a manipulator or machining tool or a laser beam positioner is controlled by the system for automatic tracking and orientation of the object over the surface of a workpiece including automatically determining the normal vector to the surface of the workpiece. It provides controllable movement and orientation of the object along selectable axes for accurate tracking of the workpiece surface by the object. The system allows processing of the workpiece by the object even when the axis of the object is oriented at an angle other than normal to the surface of the workpiece. The system when used to control a laser beam provides for control of the of the focal point of the beam at a particular displacement from the machining nozzle tip, using a least mean squares curve fitting technique and a sampled capacitive sensing device operative in the refractory interval between laser pulses and further provides for identification of a mounting fixture unique to a workpiece by sensing coding on the surface of the fixture thereby to select a particular part machining program.
