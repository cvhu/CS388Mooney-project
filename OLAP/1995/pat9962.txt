Three traveling blocks confined to rectilinear paths are propelled to and fro in those paths in coordinated programs of motion by program-controlled motors. A leg member for each of said blocks is flexibly connected at one of its ends to its respective traveling block. The three legs are flexibly interconnected at locations on the legs away from the blocks. The three legs combine the programmed rectilinear movements of the blocks to produce a corresponding programmed three-dimensional movement of a tool carried by one of said legs.
Claims I claim: 1. Apparatus for automatically moving a tool in a predetermined program of motion in three dimensions comprising: a frame; a control signal generator producing three individual coordinated programs A, B and C of motion control signals; three screw-threaded shafts M, N, and O journalled in bearings mounted on said frame and separated from each other; three signal-controlled motors D, E and F connected to receive respectively the programs A, B and C and to rotate the shafts M, N, and O correspondingly to said programs, the shafts M, N, and O being connected to be rotated by said motors D, E and F respectively; three traveling blocks G, H and I having female screw threads formed therein and threaded respectively onto the threads of the shafts M, N and O, so as to be propelled to and fro in rectilinear paths along the axes of, and proportionately to the rotations of, the shafts M, N and O respectively; three leg members J, K and L each connected at one end to a respective one of the blocks G, H and I by a respective on of three rotational hinge connections P, Q and R; said leg members J, K and L being connected together by rotational connections at locations thereon remote from their respective rotational hinge connections P, Q and R to the blocks G, H and I; a tool supported by the leg member J at a location thereon remote from the rotational hinge connection P; said rotational hinge connections P, Q and R having axes of rotation U, V and W respectively, and confining the relative rotational motion between each one of the respective leg members J, K and L and its corresponding respective one of the blocks G, H and I exclusively to rotational motion about its corresponding respective one the axes U, V and W; each of the axes U, V and W being disposed at an angle of at least 45 degrees to the axis of its corresponding respective one of the shafts M, N and O; each of the rotational hinge connections P, Q and R being the sole rotational connection between its respective one of the leg members J, K and L and its corresponding respective one of the blocks G, H and I; each of said leg members J, K, and L being free and unconfined to rotate about an axis at an angle of at least 45 degrees to the axis of its corresponding respective one of the shafts M, N, and 0; and each of said blocks G, H, and I being free and unconfined, except as constrained by its respective one of the rotational hinge connections P, Q, and R to the assemblage of the leg members J, K, and L, to rotate about an axis parallel to the axis of its corresponding respective one of the shafts M, N, and O. 2. Apparatus for automatically moving a tool in a predetermined program of motion in three dimensions comprising: a control signal generator producing three individual coordinated programs A, B and C of motion control signals; three signal-controlled motors D, E and F having shafts and connected to receive respectively the programs A, B and C and to rotate their shafts correspondingly to said programs; three traveling blocks G, H and I; means for guiding said blocks each in a rectilinear path separate from the paths of the other blocks, and for mechanically connecting the shafts of the motors D, E and F to the blocks G, H and I so as to propel the blocks to and fro in said paths, each proportionately respectively to the rotations of the shafts of the motors D, E and F; three leg members J, K and L connected respectively at one end to the blocks G, H and I by rotational connections; each of said leg members J, K and L being free and unconfined, except as constrained by its respective one of the rotational connections to the assemblage of the leg members J, K, and L, to rotate, at the end thereof adjacent its respective one of the blocks G, H and I, about an axis parallel to the direction of rectilinear motion of its respective one of the blocks G, H and I, and each of said leg members J. K and L, also being free and unconfined, except as constrained by its respective one of the rotational connections to the assemblage of the leg members J, K, and L, to rotate at the end thereof adjacent its respective one of the blocks G, H and I, about an axis at an angle of at least 45 degrees to the direction of rectilinear motion of its respective one of the blocks G, H and I said leg members being connected together by rotational connections at locations thereon remote from their connections to the blocks G, H and I; and a tool supported by the leg J at a position remote from its connection to the block G. 3.
