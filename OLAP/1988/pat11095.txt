An optoelectronic array or system permitting the simultaneous input of six isplacement components is housed in a plastic sphere wherein a fixed slit diaphragm is connected in series to each of six light-emitting devices, which are arrayed in a plane at equal angular displacements from each other. The light-emitting devices are arrayed opposite corresponding linear one-dimensional position-sensitive sensors, whose axes are aligned vertically to the direction of the slits of the corresponding slit diaphragms, so that the light-emitting devices with their corresponding slit diaphragms are adapted to move relative to the position-sensitive sensors. The individual light-emitting device allocated to each sensor is driven by an electronic controller which maintains the sum of both currents flowing in the corresponding position-sensitive sensor constant and equal for all six sub-systems and additionally regulates the radiant intensity of the light-emitting devices.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An optoelectronic system housed in a plastic sphere allowing for the simultaneous input of six displacement components, consisting of three displacements and three angular rotations in or around the three axes of a Cartesian system of coordinates, the optoelectronic system comprising: at least six light-emitting devices arranged in a plane at equal angular displacements from each other; a fixed slit diaphragm arranged in series with each of said at least six light-emitting devices; a position-sensitive sensor having two output currents is arranged in series with each of said at least six light-emitting devices and corresponding slit diaphragms, the axis of each position-sensitive sensor being aligned orthogonally to the direction of the slit of the corresponding slit diaphragm, said light emitting devices with their corresponding slit diaphragms being adapted to move with respect to the position-sensitive sensors; and an electronic controller for driving the individual light-emitting devices is allocated to each sensor so as to ensure the sum of the two outpt currents flowing out of the respective position-sensitive sensor to a constant and equal valve for all six systems and to also regulate the radiant intensity of the light-emitting devices. 2. The optoelectronic system in accordance with claim 1, which further comprises a cylindrical ring firmly attached to the inside of said plastic sphere, said position-sensitive sensors being suitably aligned and arrayed on the inside of said cylindrical ring, and spring elements disposed between said ring and a mounting device supporting the light-emitting devices in its center, so that said ring is adapted to move relative to the stationary array of said at least six light-emitting devices and respective corresponding fixed slit diaphragms in such a manner that the ring always returns to its unbiased position. 3. The optoelectronic system in accordance with claim 2, wherein said at least six light-emitting devices are housed in a mounting device to which a cylindrical slit-ring is connected by radially arranged shields, said slit diaphragms being arrayed on said slit-ring at 90.degree. angles to each other at the same angular displacements as the light-emitting devices disposed on the mounting device, said slit diaphragms being alternately arrayed opposite the corresponding light-emitting devices in a radial direction.
