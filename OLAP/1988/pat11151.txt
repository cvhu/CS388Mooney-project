A material dispensing valve finding particular application in the robotic dispensing of sealants, adhesives, etc. in a desired pattern on a workpiece. The dispensing valve comprises a unique actuating arrangement wherein back to back pancake cylinders are moveably arranged within a housing and, depending upon how the cylinders are actuated, three or four dispense rate positions can be provided. The dispense rate positions of the valve are preferably coordinated with the rate of movement of the robotic system so that the dispense rate is appropriate for the rate of movement.
Claims We claim: 1. A material dispensing valve comprising: first and second pneumatic cylinders located adjacent one another comprising closed bodies defining respective internal first and second chambers, first and second pistons in sliding arrangement within said respective first and second internal chambers, said pistons dividing each such chamber into a first section adjacent one side of each respective piston and a second section adjacent the other side of each respective piston, first and second piston rods connected to said respective first and second pistons, said piston rods extending in substantially the same direction and outwardly of said bodies; a first port in said first body arranged to communicate with said first section of said first chamber; a second port in said first body arranged to communicate with said second section of said first chamber; a third port in said second body arranged to communicate with said second section of said second chamber; a fourth port in said second body arranged to communicate with said first section of said second body; said ports being adapted for alternatively pressurizing or exhausting chamber sections; a frame for supporting said bodies; means connected to said frame between said bodies for dispensing said material, said dispensing means including a valve for controlling the dispensing rate of said material and actuating means for selectively positioning said valve in at least three positions providing at least a high dispense rate for a first position, a low dispense rate for a second position and no dispense rate for a third position, said actuating means comprising an arm pivotally connected to said valve and said first and second piston rods; control means for selectively controlling said actuating means for pressurizing or exhausting said respective sections of said cylinders through said ports to adjust said valve to a desired valve dispensing position wherein said first valve position is obtained by said first port being exhausted, said second port being pressurized, said third port being pressurized and said fourth port being exhausted, said second valve position is obtained by said first port being pressurized, said second port being exhausted, said third port being pressurized and said fourth port being exhausted, said third valve position is obtained by said first port being pressurized, said second port being exhausted, said third port being exhausted and said fourth port being pressurized; and whereby said valve is operationally responsive to the movement of said piston rods to provide said at least three valve positions. 2. A dispensing valve as in claim 1 wherein said valve for controlling said dispensing rate comprises a dispensing passageway and a valve stem having a bulbous end arranged for movement within said passageway so that said bulbous end can move toward and away from a free end of said passageway and wherein said valve stem is connected to said arm. 3. A dispensing valve as in claim 2 wherein means are provided for adjusting the stroke of said valve stem to set the overall limit of dispense rate for said respective valve positions.
