A compound toggle robotic gripper mechanism employs a pair of spaced, opposed gripping jaws, each pivotally mounted to a base and interconnected to an actuator, such as a hydraulic cylinder-piston assembly, by a compound toggle mechanism. The compound toggle mechanism preferably includes a first toggle interconnecting the actuator and second and third toggles. The second and third toggles interconnect the actuator through the first toggle to each of the spaced, opposed gripping jaws respectively so that extension of the actuator rod urges the first, second and third toggles from their released positions simultaneously into a locking position as the gripping jaws are moved into gripping engagement of a workpiece or tool.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic gripper comprising: a pair of spaced, opposed gripping jaws each pivotally mounted to a base; a compound toggle mechanism comprising a first toggle including first and second arms pivotally joined at one end for movement from a released position to a locked position, a second toggle including third and fourth arms pivotally joined at one end and operably connected to the free end of the first arm for movement from a released position to a locked position, the free end of the third arm operably connected to one of the gripping jaws, the free end of the fourth arm operably connected to the base, and a third toggle including fifth and sixth arms pivotally joined at one end and operably connected to the free end of the second arm for movement from a released position to a locked position, the free end of the fifth arm operably connected to the other gripping jaw, the free end of the sixth arm operably connected to the base; and an actuator operably connected to the first toggle for shifting the first, second and third toggles from their respective released positions to their respective locked positions, thereby moving the gripping jaws from an unclamped position to a clamped position. 2. The robotic gripper of claim 1 wherein each of the first, second and third toggles are configured so that each toggle is simultaneously shifted from its released position to its locked position. 3. The robotic gripper of claim 1 wherein the arms of the toggles are generally planar links. 4. The robotic gripper of claim 1 wherein at least one of the arms of the first, second and third toggles comprises a pair of generally parallel links. 5. The robotic gripper of claim 1 wherein the actuator is a hydraulic cylinder-piston assembly. 6. The robotic gripper of claim 1 wherein each of the gripping jaws includes an arm having a gripping surface, and a leg joined at one end to the arm, and wherein each of the gripping jaws is pivotally mounted to the base at the other end of the leg, and wherein the third arm and fifth arm are operably connected to their respective gripping jaws at the end of the leg adjoining the arm of their respective gripping jaw. 7. The robotic gripper of claim 1 wherein each of the gripping jaws includes an arm having a gripping surface, and a leg joined at one end to the arm, and wherein each of the gripping jaws is pivotally mounted to the base at the end of the leg adjoining the arm and wherein the third arm and fifth arm are operably connected to their respective gripping jaws at the other end of the leg of that respective gripping jaw. 8. A robotic gripper comprising: a pair of spaced, opposed gripping jaws, each pivotally mounted on a base; a compound toggle mechanism comprising a first toggle including first and second links pivotally joined at one end for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, a second toggle including third and fourth links each pivotally joined at one end to the free end of the first link, for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, the free end of the third link pivotally joined to one of the gripping jaws, the free end of the fourth link pivotally joined to the base, and a third toggle including fifth and sixth links each pivotally joined at one end to the free end of the second link, for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, the free end of the fifth link pivotally joined to the other gripping jaw, and the free end of the sixth link pivotally joined to the base, an actuator for shifting the toggles from their folded, released positions overcenter to locked position, thereby moving the gripping jaws from an unclamped position to a clamped position. 9. A robotic gripper comprising: a base; a first generally L-shaped gripping jaw having an arm and a leg, the arm including a first gripping surface, and the leg being joined at the arm at one end and pivotally joined to the base at its opposite end; a second generally L-shaped gripping jaw having an arm and a leg, the arm including a first gripping surface, and the leg being joined at the arm at one end and pivotally joined to the base at its opposite end; a compound toggle mechanism comprising a first toggle including first and second links pivotally joined at one end for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, a second toggle including third and fourth links each pivotally joined at one end to the free end of the first link, for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, the free end of the third link pivotally joined to the first gripping jaw at the end of the leg adjoining the arm, the free end of the fourth link pivotally joined to the base, and a third toggle including fifth and sixth links each pivotally joined at one end to the free end of the second link, for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, the free end of the fifth link pivotally joined to the second gripping jaw at the end of the leg adjoining the arm, and the free end of the sixth link pivotally joined to the base, an actuator for shifting the toggles from their folded, released positions overcenter to locked position, thereby moving the gripping jaws from an unclamped position to a clamped position. 10. A robotic gripper comprising: a base; a first generally L-shaped gripping jaw having an arm and a leg, the arm including a first gripping surface, and the leg being joined at the arm and pivotally joined to the base at one end; a second generally L-shaped gripping jaw having an arm and a leg, the arm including a first gripping surface, and the leg being joined at the arm and pivotally joined to the base at one end; a compound toggle mechanism comprising a first toggle including first and second links pivotally joined at one end for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, a second toggle including third and fourth links each pivotally joined at one end to the free end of the first link, for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, the free end of the third link pivotally joined to the first gripping jaw at the end of the leg opposite the end adjoining the arm, the free end of the fourth link pivotally joined to the base, and a third toggle including fifth and sixth links each pivotally joined at one end to the free end of the second link, for movement from a folded, released position overcenter to a locked position, the free end of the fifth link pivotally joined to the second gripping jaw at the end of the leg opposite the end adjoining the arm, and the free end of the sixth link pivotally joined to the base, an actuator for shifting the toggles from their folded, released positions overcenter to locked position, thereby moving the gripping jaws from an unclamped position to a clamped position.
