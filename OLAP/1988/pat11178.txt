A method and device are shown for manufacturing rotary rock bits. The method eliminates repositioning errors in robotic welding operations by combining a cutting torch and a welding torch on a single, rotatable bracket whereby a bit can be welded at a single station without multiple rechuckings. The quality of the weld tie-in between any two intersecting seams (radial-radial or radial-axial) results where the groove for the latter seam in each pair is cut after the first seam in the pair has been welded.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for manufacturing a rotary rock bit by welding separate sections of the bit together along seams between the sections, the bit having a connecting end for connection to a drill string for rotation about a vertical axis, comprising the steps of: assembling the bit sections in a suitable fixture, the assembled sections forming radial seams which lie in planes that radially intersect the axis of rotation of the bit and forming outside, axial seams which lie in planes generally parallel to the bit axis of rotation; cutting a first radial weld groove and then welding the first radial weld groove at a single welding station by means of a welding tool having both a cutting torch and a welding torch mounted on a single bracket; cutting a second radial weld groove end which intersects the first radial weld and then welding the second radial weld groove at the same welding station; repeating the process for all additional radial welds; cutting outside, axial weld grooves which intersect each radial weld and welding the outside, axial weld grooves at the same welding station. 2. A method for manufacturing a rotary rock bit by welding separate sections of the bit together along seams between the sections, the bit having a connecting end for connection in a drill string for rotation about a vertical axis, comprising the steps of: assembling the bit sections in a suitable fixture, the assembled sections forming radial seams which lie in planes that radially intersect the axis of rotation of the bit and forming outside, axial seams which lie in planes generally parallel to the bit axis of rotation; cutting a first radial weld groove and then welding the first radial weld groove at a single welding station by means of a welding tool having both a cutting torch and a welding torch mounted on a single bracket; cutting a second radial weld groove including a tie-in groove with the first radial weld and then welding the second radial weld groove at the same welding station; repeating the process for all additional radial welds; cutting outside, axial weld grooves which intersect each radial weld and which include a tie-in groove at the point of intersection with the respective radial weld and welding the outside, axial weld groovs at the same welding station. 3. A method for manufacturing a rotary rock bit by welding separate sections of the bit together along seams between the sections, each of the sections including a rotatable cutter mounted on a bearing pin extending from the section, the bit having a connecting end for connection in a drill string for rotation about a vertical axis, comprising the steps of: assembling three bit sections in a suitable fixture, the assembled sections forming three radial seams which lie in planes that radially intersect the axis of rotation of the bit and forming three outside, axial seams which lie in planes generally parallel to the bit axis of rotation; cutting a first radial weld groove and then welding the first radial weld groove at a single welding station by means of a welding tool having both a cutting torch and a welding torch mounted on a single bracket; cutting a second radial weld groove including a tie-in groove with the first radial weld and then welding the second radial weld groove at the same welding station; cutting a third radial weld groove including a tie-in groove with the second radial weld and then welding the third radial weld groove at the same welding station; next, cutting an outside, axial weld groove which intersects each radial weld and which includes a tie-in groove at the point of intersection with the respective radial weld, followed by welding each of the outside, axial weld grooves at the same welding station. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the cutting operation is performed by means of an air carbon arc cutting torch and wherein the welding operation is performed by means of a gas shielded flux-cored-arc welding torch. 5. The method of claim 4, wherein the welding tool is provided with a welding torch on one arm and a cutting torch on another arm, the arms being joined at a stationary, Y-shaped juncture, and wherein the juncture is connected to a rotatable plate adapted to rotate the arms about a vertical axis.
