The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for inserting the gerotor oil pump assembly into the housing of an engine. The present invention provides a first jaw and a second jaw which allow the gear assembly to be picked up by the robot or the like while at the same time decreasing the possibility of lock up between the primary outer and secondary inner gears of the gerotor assembly.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including a primary outer gear having first and second sides and a secondary inner gear into an oil pump housing, said EOAT comprising in combination: a frame; a first jaw connected with said frame, said first jaw being adapted to grab a first side of said primary gear; and a second jaw connected with and movably by said frame having first and second fingers, said first finger being adapted to grab said second side of said primary gear and said second finger being adapted to grab and have slight relative movement with said secondary gear whereby relative movement of said first and second jaws towards one another causes said first finger of said second jaw and said first jaw to grab said primary gear and whereby said second finger captures said secondary gear to said first side of said primary gear and imparts an eccentric rotational movement to said secondary gear to kick out said secondary gear from possible lock up with said primary gear thereby allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly. 2. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) as described in claim 1 wherein said second finger has mounted thereto a roller for capturing said secondary gear to said primary gear. 3. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including a primary outer gear having first and second sides and interior teeth of a first number, and a secondary inner gear having exterior teeth of a second number into an oil pump housing, said EOAT comprising in combination; a gripper frame; a first jaw connected with and movable by said gripper frame, said first jaw having a moon shaped end adapted to grab a first side of said primary gear; and a second jaw conected with and movable by said gripper frame having a first finger with a moon shaped end being adapted to grab said second side of said primary gear and said second jaw also having a second finger with a rotatably mounted roller adapted to grab and have slight rotative movement with said secondary gear whereby relative movement of said first and second jaws towards one another causes said first jaw and said first finger of said second jaw to grab said primary gear and whereby said second finger roller captures said secondary gear to said first side of said primary gear and imparts an eccentric rotational movement to said seocndary gear to kick out said secondary gear from possible lockup with said primary gear thereby allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly. 4. A method of using a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including a primary outer gear having first and second sides and a secondary inner gear into an oil pump housing utilizing an end of arm tooling device (EOAT) gripper, said method in combination comprising: connecting with said EOAT gripper a first jaw, and a second jaw having two fingers; grabbing a first side of the primary gear with said first jaw; grabbing said second side of the primary gear with said first finger of said second jaw; capturing said secondary gear to said first side of said primary gear with said second finger of said second jaw; relatively moving said second finger with said secondary gear whereby said second finger imparts an eccentric rotational movement to said secondary gear to kick out said secondary gear from possible lock ups with said primary gear allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly. 5. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including a primary outer gear and a secondary inner gear into an oil pump housing of an engine, said inner gear having an inner diameter, said EOAT comprising in combination: a frame; a first jaw connected with said frame, said first jaw being adapted to grab said primary gear; and a second jaw connected with and movable by said frame having a foot with a tapered surface with respect to said secondary gear inner diameter adapted to grab and urge said secondary gear upwards, whereby relative movement of said first and second jaws towards one another causes said second jaw to capture said secondary gear to said primary gear thereby allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly. 6. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including a primary outer gear and a secondary inner gear into an oil pump housing of an engine, said inner gear having an inner diameter with a portion having a radius of curvature less than a first value, said EOAT comprising in combination: a frame; a first jaw connected with said frame, said first jaw being adapted to grab said primary gear; and a second jaw connected with and movable by said frame having a foot with a tapered surface with respect to said secondary gear inner diameter with a radius of curvature equal to said first value adapted to grab and urge said secondary gear upward whereby relative movement of said first and second jaw towards one another causes said second jaw to capture said secondary gear to said primary gear and said foot imparts an eccentric rotational movement to said secondary gear to kick out said secondary gear from possible lock up with said primary gear thereby allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly. 7. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) as described in claim 5 having a generally elongated frame and said second jaw being pivotally connected with said frame and said second jaw being pivotably connected with a cylinder actuated piston rod extending longitudinally along said frame. 8. An EOAT as described in claim 5 further including a sensor to determine the presence of at least one of said primary or secondary gears. 9. An EOAT as described in claim 5 further including means to confirm the loading of said gear assembly into said oil pump housing. 10. An end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including primary outer gear and a secondary inner gear into an oil pump housing of an engine, said inner gear having an inner diameter with a portion having a radius of curvature less than a first value, said EOAT comprising in combination: a longitudinally extending frame; first and second sensors connected with said frame for detecting the pesence of said primary and said secondary gears; a first jaw fixably connected with said frame, said first jaw being adapted to grab said primary gear; a second jaw pivotally connected with said frame and also pivotally connected with a cylinder actuated piston rod longitudinally mounted to said frame; and said second jaw having a foot with a tapered surface with respect to said secondary gear inner diameter, said tapered foot having a radius of curvature equal to said first value adapted to grab and urge said secondary gear upward whereby relative movement of said second jaw towards said first jaw causes said second jaw to capture said secondary gear to said primary gear and impart an eccentric rotational movement to said secondary gear to kick out said secondary gear from possible lock up with said primary gear thereby allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly; and means to sense the location of said gear assembly whereby the proper loading of said gear assembly within said gear housing is confirmed. 11. A method of using a robot or the like to load a gerotor oil pump gear assembly including a primary outer gear and a secondary inner gear with an inner diameer to an oil pump housing utilizing an end of arm tooling device (EOAT) gripper, said method in combination comprising: conecting with said EOAT gripper a first jaw and a second jaw haing a tapered foot; grabbing said primary gear with said first jaw; grabbing and urging upwards said interior diameter of said secondary gear with said tapered foot of said second jaw; and capturing said secondary gear to said primary gear with said second jaw foot whereby said tapered foot imparts in an eccentric rotational movement to said second gear to kick out said secondary gear from possible lock up with said primary gear allowing said robot or the like to grab said gear assembly.
