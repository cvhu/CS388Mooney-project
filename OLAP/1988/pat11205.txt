A circuit breaker panelboard modular assembly employs a plurality of interdependent molded plastic and metal parts to multifunctionally adapt breakers of different ratings for electrical connection within the panelboard enclosure. Anti-turn connector connects the line strap terminal. Captive bolts or plug-in connections are employed to attach the breakers to the power bus. A novel concealed hinge construction is used to connect the panelboard door to the panelboard housing and the breakers are individually identified within the housing by extruded plastic circuit markers.
Claims Having described our invention, what we claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent is: 1. A circuit breaker panelboard assembly comprising: closure means comprising opposing side walls and opposing end walls joined by a bottom housing at least one main circuit breaker or at least one main wire terminal lug and a plurality of branch circuit breakers; access means movably arranged on said closure means providing access to said main and said branch circuit breakers from outside of said closure means; circuit breaker mounting means within said closure supporting said branch circuit breakers and providing electrical connection between said branch circuit breakers and electrical bus bars connectable with an external circuit; shield means intermediate said access means and said main and branch circuit breakers preventing contact with electrical terminals on said main and branch circuit breakers; and a pair of angulated brackets attached at one end to said bottom and at an opposite end to a corresponding pair of mounting rails, said circuit breaker mounting means being arranged across said pair of mounting rails; said angulated brackets each comprising a metal plate formed into a top and a bottom step offset from a vertical riser, said top and bottom steps each containing a keyhole shaped opening and a plurality of bolt access openings, said top and bottom keyhole shaped openings each facing in opposite directions and each defining a large and small diameter passage; whereby the small diameter passage on said bottom keyhole shaped opening is opposite in direction from said small diameter passage on said top keyhole shaped opening. 2. The circuit breaker panelboard assembly of claim 1 wherein each of said branch circuit breakers carries three terminal connections attached to one end of each breaker for electrical connection with said bus bars, and a captive screw arranged through each of said terminal connections and through corresponding tubular sleeves, said tubular sleeves being adapted for ease in connecting said terminal connections with said bus bars.
