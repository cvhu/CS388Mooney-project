A planet gear set and method of assembling the carrier on the sun and ring gear particularly suited for automation of the carrier assembly operation. The sun gear of the planetary set has a staging annulus formed on one end thereof defined between the addendum and dedendum circles of the sun gear teeth. The sun gear also has a frustoconical concentricity chamfer formed on the same end with one edge contiguous with dedendum circle edge of the staging annulus. The carrier, with the planet gears thereon, is aligned on the axis of rotation of the sun gear and advanced toward the same. If the sun gear is eccentric relative to its axis of rotation, the planet gears engage the concentricity chamfer and cam the sun gear to an aligned position which is achieved when the carrier achieves a staged position relative to the sun gear. In the staged position, the addendum circles of the planet gears are tangent to the dedendum circle edge of the staging annulus. The carrier is then mildly biased toward the sun gear and rotated, whereupon the teeth of the planet gears sequentially achieve meshing engagement with the sun gear teeth.
