A method to provide redundant accessor availabilty in an automated data storage library. The method provides a data storage and retrieval system comprising one or more data storage devices a robot accessor and a gripper. Either at the same time or at a later time, the user obtains a second gripper and/or a second accessor. The method allows selection and/or authorization for additional support from the second gripper and/or the second accessor upon request and authorization. The redundant accessor capabilities are provided on an honor system for payment for the additional capability, and/or uses a system for tracking the redundant accessor usage, and/or uses license keys or other controls that must be obtained prior to enabling redundant accessor capabilities.
