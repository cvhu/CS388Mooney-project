Sequences of B.sub.12-dependent dehydratases with improved reaction kinetics are presented. Use of these B.sub.12-dependent dehydratases reduce the rate of the enzyme's suicide inactivation in the presence of glycerol and 1,3-propanediol. The enzymes were created using error-prone PCR and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to target the DhaB1 gene, which encodes the .alpha.-subunit of glycerol dehydratase. Mutants with improved reaction kinetics were rapidly identified using high throughput assays.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A nucleic acid sequence encoding a B.sub.12-dependent mutant dehydratase, said nucleic acid sequence having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:313. 2. A nucleic acid sequence encoding a B.sub.12-dependent mutant dehydratase comprising an .alpha.-.beta. subunit fusion, said .alpha. subunit having the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:314 at positions 1-555 and said .beta. subunit having the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:314 at positions 562-754. 3. The nucleic acid sequence of claim 2, further comprising a linker sequence between the .alpha. and .beta. subunits of the .alpha.-.beta. subunit fusion, wherein the linker sequence is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:18 and SEQ ID NO:19. 4. The nucleic acid sequence of claim 3, wherein the nucleic acid sequence encodes a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:314.
