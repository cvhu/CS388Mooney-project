A multi-fit orthotic structure including an attachment system for coupling the orthotic structure to a wide variety of subjects without requiring a custom fit. In one embodiment, active mobility assistance is provided via an orthotic system capable of integrating a linear actuator and linkage system to deliver torque to the lower leg of a subject to facilitate flexion and/or extension motion of the subject's leg. The orthotic structure is attached to the subject using a textile suspension system which does not require the orthotic structure to interface directly in the knee region or at the lateral areas of the thigh and calf of the subject, thus providing an ideal fit for the widest possible range of subjects with the minimum number of required sizes.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A multi-fit orthotic apparatus using a textile-based suspension, the apparatus comprising: a thigh orthotic structure coupled with a thigh suspension textile; a lower leg orthotic structure coupled with an upper shin suspension textile; a lateral support structure coupled with a lower leg suspension textile, the lateral support structure positioned on both lateral sides of a lower leg of a subject, wherein each suspension textile conforms closely to the subject to accommodate a wide range of subjects without a custom fit; a tibia anterior structure; a tibia posterior structure coupled with the tibia anterior structure; and a tibia suspension system coupled with the tibia posterior structure and the lateral support structure to transmit force to the lateral support structure. 2. The multi-fit orthotic apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of independent tensioning systems including: an independent proximal thigh textile tensioning system coupled with the thigh suspension textile, the proximal thigh textile tensioning system configured to adjust tension across a thigh of the subject and to distribute force evenly throughout the thigh suspension textile to gain leverage when applying torque to a leg of the subject; an independent knee-lock textile tensioning system coupled with the upper shin suspension textile, the knee-lock textile tensioning system configured to adjust tension around a knee region of the subject; and an independent lower shin textile tensioning system coupled with the lower leg suspension textile, the lower shin textile tensioning system configured to adjust tension across the lateral support structure. 3. The multi-fit orthotic apparatus of claim 2, wherein the independent knee-lock textile tensioning system is further configured to properly locate the subject's knee joint axis in a coaxial configuration with the hinge joints of the orthotic apparatus.
