Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC).alpha., PKC.delta. and PKC.zeta. are provided which are selective for those PKC isotypes. Combinatorial libraries for identifying protein kinases are also provided, as are methods of identifying protein kinases using those libraries. Additionally, methods of treating a mammal having a deleterious condition, where the condition is dependent on a protein kinase for induction or severity, are provided. Methods of inhibiting protein kinases are also provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An inhibitor of a protein kinase C.alpha. (PKC.alpha.), the inhibitor comprising A-Ala-Arg-Arg-X-B-Hyd-C-D- (SEQ ID NO:1), where A=AcHN--, ##STR00025## X=any amino acid; B=Ala or a diaminopropionic acid (Dap) derivative having the formula ##STR00026## Hyd=Phe, Leu or Ile; C=Ara or Lys: and D=Ala or a Dap derivative having the formula ##STR00027## 2. The inhibitor of claim 1, wherein the PKC.alpha. is a human PKC.alpha.. 3. An inhibitor of a protein kinase C.alpha. (PKC.alpha.), the inhibitor comprising ##STR00028## 4. The inhibitor of claim 1, having an IC.sub.50<50 .mu.M for the PKC.alpha.. 5. The inhibitor of claim 1, having an IC.sub.50<10 .mu.M for the PKC.alpha.. 6.
