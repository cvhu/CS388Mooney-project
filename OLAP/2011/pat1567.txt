A method is described for mapping dense sensory data to a Sensory Ego Sphere (SES). Methods are also described for finding and ranking areas of interest in the images that form a complete visual scene on an SES. Further, attentional processing of image data is best done by performing attentional processing on individual full-size images from the image sequence, mapping each attentional location to the nearest node, and then summing all attentional locations at each node.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of mapping dense sensory data to a database of a robot comprising: compiling a list of nodes in a portion of a spherical region centered on the robot; generating an image of a region external to the robot at each node using an external sensor of the robot; extracting a foveal image from a center of each image using a sensory processing module of the robot; and associating each foveal image with said node in the database. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the portion of the spherical region is a sensory ego sphere. 3. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising a program for: compiling a list of nodes in a portion of a spherical region centered on a robot; generating an image of a region external to the robot at each node; extracting a foveal image from a center of each image; and associating each foveal image with said node in the database.
