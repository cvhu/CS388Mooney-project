A method of generating a cell lineage tree of a plurality of cells of an individual is provided. The method comprising: (a) determining at least one genotypic marker for each cell of the plurality of cells; and (b) computationally clustering data representing the at least one genotypic marker to thereby generate the cell lineage tree of the plurality of cells of the individual.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of assessing clonality of a neoplasm in an individual, the method comprising: (a) obtaining a cell sample of the neoplasm of the individual; (b) determining at least one genotypic marker for each cell of said cell sample of the neoplasm; and (c) computationally clustering data representing said at least one genotypic marker and additional genotypic markers of a plurality of cells, to thereby assess clonality of the neoplasm in the individual. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said genotypic marker is a cell division marker. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said genotypic marker exhibits somatic variability. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein said genotypic marker exhibiting somatic variability is a repetitive sequence element. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein said clustering is effected by a clustering algorithm. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the neoplasm is of a blood forming tissue. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the neoplasm is a cancer of unknown primary tumor.
