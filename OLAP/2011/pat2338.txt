Systems and methods for discriminating and locating tissues within a body involve applying a waveform signal to tissue between two electrodes and measuring the electrical characteristics of the signal transmitted through the tissue. At least one of the electrodes is constrained in area so that localized electrical characteristics of the tissue are measured. Such localized electrical characteristics are determined over a portion of a body of the subject by using an array of electrodes or electrodes that can be moved over the body. A controller may implement the process and perform calculations on the measured data to identify tissue types and locations within the measured area, and to present results in graphical form. Results may be combined with other tissue imaging technologies and with image-guided systems.
