A storage device testing system that includes at least one rack, test slots housed by each rack, and at least one air mover in pneumatic communication with the test slots. Each test slot includes a test slot housing having an entrance and an exit, with the entrance configured to receive a storage device. The at least one air mover is configured to move air exterior to the racks into the entrance of each test slot housing, over the received storage device, and out of the exit of each test slot housing.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A storage device testing system comprising: at least one rack; an air heat exchanger configured for pneumatic communication with the at least one rack; and one or more test slots housed by the at least one rack, a test slot comprising: a test slot housing defining an entrance and an exit, the entrance configured to receive a storage device, and at least one of the entrance and the exit configured for pneumatic communication with the air heat exchanger; and a test slot air mover configured for pneumatic communication with the test slot housing and further configured to move air exterior to the at least one rack into the entrance of the test slot housing, over the storage device received in the entrance of the test slot housing, through the air heat exchanger, out of the exit of the test slot housing, and out of the at least one rack; wherein the test slot air mover is configured to move the air through the air heat exchanger at least one of before and after passing over the storage device received in the entrance of the test slot housing. 2. The storage device testing system of claim 1, wherein the at least one rack comprises an air conduit configured for pneumatic communication between the exit of the test slot housing and the air heat exchanger. 3. The storage device testing system of claim 1, wherein the entrance of the test slot housing is configured to receive a storage device transporter, the storage device transporter comprises a first portion and a second portion, the first portion of the storage device transporter comprises an air director, the second portion of the storage device transporter is configured to receive the storage device, and the air director is configured to direct the air substantially simultaneously over at least top and bottom surfaces of the storage device received in the storage device transporter. 4. The storage device testing system of claim 3, wherein the test slot air mover is further configured to move the air exterior to the at least one rack into the air director of the storage device transporter of the test slot, and wherein the air director is configured to direct the air over the storage device received in the storage device transporter and out of the exit of the test slot housing. 5. The storage device testing system of claim 3, wherein the air director of the storage device transporter defines at least one air entrance, the storage device having top, bottom, front, rear, right, and left side surfaces, a front surface of the storage device having an electrical connector, the storage device being received by the storage device transporter with a rear surface of the storage device substantially facing the first portion of the storage device transporter, and wherein the at least one air entrance is configured to direct air over at least top and bottom surfaces of the storage device received in the entrance of the test slot housing.
