The method of claim 3 wherein said compound is selected from the group consisting of formula I and formula II wherein R.sub.1 is H. 8. The method as recited in claim 7 wherein R.sub.8 is H, C.sub.1-C.sub.10alkyl, C.sub.3-C.sub.8cycloalkyl, hydroxy(C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkyl), dihydroxy(C.sub.2-C.sub.6alkyl) or C.sub.1-C.sub.6alkoxycarbonyl and R.sub.9 is H. 9. The method as recited in claim 8 wherein said compound is: 5-aminomethyl-3-phenylsulfanyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid amide. 10. The method of claim 9 wherein said inhibition of casein kinase I.epsilon. activity results in a lengthening of circadian rhythm period. 11. The method of claim 1 wherein the disorder is mood disorder. 12. The method according to claim 11 wherein the mood disorder is selected from the group consisting of a depressive disorder and a bipolar disorder. 13. The method according to claim 12 wherein the depressive disorder is major depressive disorder. 14. The method of claim 12 wherein the mood disorder is a bipolar disorder. 15. The method of claim 14 wherein the bipolar disorder is selected from the group consisting of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. 16. The method of claim 1 wherein the disorder is a sleep disorder. 17. The method of claim 16 wherein the sleep disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. 18. The method of claim 17 wherein the circadian rhythm sleep disorder is selected from the group consisting of shift work sleep disorder, jet lag syndrome, advanced sleep phase syndrome and delayed sleep phase syndrome.
