The invention relates to systems and methods for analyzing clinically relevant nucleic acid sequences.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A fully automated system for performing an assay on a biological sample, comprising: (a) a sample transfer module for transferring a portion of the sample to a well of a first multi-well plate and programmed to exchange with at least one other module of the system information about the location of the portion in the first multi-well plate; (b) a nucleic acid extraction module for extracting nucleic acids from cells within the portion and for transferring the portion from the first multi-well plate to a well of a second multi-well plate; (c) a nucleic acid measurement module for measuring the concentration of nucleic acids in the portion; (d) a PCR preparation module for adding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction materials to the portion and programmed to receive information from (a) about the location of the portion in the first or second multi-well plate, and wherein the PCR preparation module comprises the primer set SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, and SEQ ID NO. 15; (e) a thermocyling module for amplifying a target sequence and extending a primer in the portion; (f) a primer extension preparation module for adding primer extension reaction materials to the portion; (g) a mass spectrometry preparation module for moving a sample of the portion to a support for analysis by mass spectrometry; (h) a mass spectrometry module for analyzing the sample; (i) a central controller: (1) in communication with, and programmed to exchange information about the biological sample with, an outside system or database; and (2) in communication with, and programmed to exchange information about the biological sample with, at least (a)-(h) of the system; and (j) plate editor software programmed to a multi-well plate where the portion will be located prior to dispensing of the portion into a well of the multi-well plate, exchange information with at least (a), (d) and (i) of the system and an outside system or database, exchange information with (a) and (d) about which well in a multi-well plate will receive or contains the portion, and exchange information with (d) about which assay to perform on the portion.
