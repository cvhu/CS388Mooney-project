In a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an automated, computerized method for learning object recognition in an image is provided. According to a feature of the present invention, the method comprises the steps of providing a training set of standard images, calculating intrinsic images corresponding to the standard images and building a classifier as a function of the intrinsic images.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated, computerized method for recognizing an object in an image, comprising the steps of: providing a classifier; providing an image; calculating an intrinsic image corresponding to the image; and utilizing the classifier to identify objects of interest in the intrinsic image; and wherein the step of calculating an intrinsic image corresponding to the image is carried out by providing a BIDR model representation of the image, and generating the corresponding intrinsic image as a function of the BIDR model representation. 2. An automated, computerized method for recognizing an object in an image, comprising the steps of: providing a classifier generated as a function of intrinsic images derived from a standard image training set and selected from the group consisting of a material image and an illumination image and further as a function of features from the intrinsic images selected from the group consisting of features calculated from the material images, features calculated from the illumination images, and features calculated from relationships between both the material images and the illumination images; and utilizing the classifier to identify objects of interest in an image.
