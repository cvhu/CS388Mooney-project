Luciferase enzymes with greatly increased thermostability, e.g., at least half lives of 2 hours at 50.degree. C., cDNAs encoding the novel luciferases, and hosts transformed to express the luciferases, are disclosed. Methods of producing the luciferases include recursive mutagenesis. The luciferases are used in conventional methods, some employing kits.
