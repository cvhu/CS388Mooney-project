Fuel less ACS for solar sails, using furl- and unfurl able ballast-sail-foil-segments for simultaneously displacement of center of mass and center of solar radiation pressure into opposite directions to each other. Solar-Sail-Launch-System for direct launch of the System-Sail including already docked in daughter units and payload in the sailcraft's central docking station. Unlike todays launch able solar sail designs the System-Sail features ample solar cell arrays and additional SEP-thruster-units for steering and propulsion, while the solar sail rather serves for longtime fuel less attitude controls and station keeping. The SEP-Sailcraft may also serve as a carrier-ship for daughter-units in asteroid exploration missions and is able to deliver prospector landers back to LEO with furled in foils.

The solar sail launch system of claim 5, wherein the lines of said sail foil roll winches comprise predetermined breaking points, whereby said lines can be broken by the forces exerted by the sail foil roll winches once said sail foil rolls have been locked into said operational position. 7. The solar sail launch system of claim 1, wherein said ring structure is releaseably secured to said rotatable platform by means of holding damps, and wherein said telescoping masts each comprise nested telescoping sections comprising spring-biased locking pin assemblies, and wherein means for rotating said rotatable platform cause rotation of said platform, whereby centrifugal forces are generated through rotation which pull said telescoping masts into their extended conditions in which each nested mast section can be locked by the action of said spring-biased locking pins. 8. The solar sail launch system of claim 7, wherein each spring-biased locking pin assembly comprises a spring located in an open-ended sleeve extending transversely to one section of a telescoping mast, and the spring acts on a respective pair of locking pins, each pin extending from a respective end of the sleeve, to an adjacent section of the telescoping mast within which said nested section slides, the outer mast segment being provided with holes in which the pins pressing outwards from the nested section can engage when said nested mast section is stopped in said extended condition at a pullout lock which is attached to the end of each outer segment. 9. The solar sail launch system of claim 1, wherein each sail foil roll is provided with motors for rotating the roll about its own axis. 10. The solar sail launch system of claim 1, wherein each sail foil roll is provided with a motor for rotating said roll of sail foil about the axis of the telescoping mast upon which it is supported. 11. The solar sail launch system of claim 1, wherein of said sail foils two different sail foil types exist, the regular sail foils, which are consisting of a foil segment only and the steering sail foils, said steering sail foils each comprise a foil segment at a proximal end and a ballast segment at a distal end with respect to said plurality of connected rings, wherein said ballast segments are made of a material that is heavier and thicker than the foil segments, wherein said steering sail foils are arranged in steering pairs such that the two steering sail foils of a steering pair are located at opposite sides with respect to the second plurality of connected rings, said means for selectively unfurling and reefing said sail foils of the solar sail mothership spacecraft being capable of moving the center of mass of the solar sail mothership spacecraft by selectively unfurling and reefing the sail foils of said steering pairs. 12.
