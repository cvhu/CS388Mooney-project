A vehicle body assembly line locator assembly (16) includes locators (18) driven by horizontal longitudinal X, horizontal sideways Y and vertical Z power operated actuators (50. 58. 72) and having locator pins (82) received by vehicle body positioning holes (84) upon upward movement to provide accurate positioning. As the locator pins (82) are moved upwardly and initially move into the vehicle body positioning holes (84 ), the horizontal power operated actuators (50,58) are back driven. The upward movement is continued so that vertical rest surfaces (80) of locator heads (78) contact the vehicle body (20) and provide lifting thereof upwardly off a system conveyor, and the power operated actuators then move the vehicle body to the proper positioning for further assembly.
