A video sensor device is provided which incorporates a rangefinder function. The device includes a single video camera and a fixed laser spaced a predetermined distance from the camera for, when activated, producing a laser beam. A diffractive optic element divides the beam so that multiple light spots are produced on a target object. A processor calculates the range to the object based on the known spacing and angles determined from the light spots on the video images produced by the camera.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic inspection device comprising a mobile robot and a video sensor device mounted on the robot, said video sensor device comprising: a housing; a single video camera and an associated lens, supported by the housing and having a field of view for providing images of a target; a single fixed laser, supported by the housing a predetermined distance from said single video camera, for, when activated, producing a laser beam; a diffractive optic element, supported in front of the fixed laser, for converting the laser beam produced by said laser into a plurality of laser spots on the target being imaged by said camera so that the images of the target produced by the camera within the field of view of the camera include laser spots; and a processor connected to the camera for determining the distance between the camera and the target based on at least one image including laser spots produced by the camera and said predetermined, wherein the laser has a boresight and the camera has a boresight and the distance between the camera and the target is determined using the formula: .function..function. ##EQU00005## wherein d is the predetermined distance in a vertical direction between the laser boresight and the camera boresight, a.sub.i is the angle between the camera boresight and a predetermined laser spot in the vertical direction, and b.sub.i is the angle between the laser beam directed to the predetermined laser spot and the laser boresight in the vertical direction; and wherein said device further includes a frame grabber connected to or forming part of said camera and an image storage memory connected to said frame grabber and to said processor for storing image frames for retrieval by the processor. 2. A robotic inspection device for inspecting space vehicle hardware, said robotic inspection device comprising a mobile robot adapted for movement within a space vehicle in which the space vehicle hardware is located, said mobile robot including a video sensor device comprising: a single video camera and an associated lens, supported by the mobile robot and having a field of view, for providing images of a hardware target; a fixed laser, supported by the mobile robot a predetermined distance from said single video camera, for, when activated, producing a laser beam; a diffractive optic element, supported in front of the fixed laser, for converting the laser beam produced by said laser into a plurality of laser spots on the target being imaged by said camera so that the images of the target produced by the camera within the field of view of the camera include laser spots; and a processor, supported by the mobile robot and connected to the camera, for determining the distance between the camera and the target based on at least one image including laser spots produced by the camera and said predetermined, wherein the laser has a boresight and the camera has a boresight and the processor determines the distance between the camera and the target using the formula: .function..function. ##EQU00006## wherein d is the predetermined distance in a vertical direction between the laser boresight and the camera boresight, a.sub.i is the angle between the camera boresight and a predetermined laser spot in the vertical direction, and b.sub.i is the angle between the laser beam directed to the predetermined laser spot and the laser boresight in the vertical direction; and wherein said device further includes a frame grabber connected to or forming part of said camera and an image storage memory connected to said frame grabber and to said processor for storing image frames for retrieval by the processor.
