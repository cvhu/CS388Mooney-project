Interative, preferably computer based iterative processes for generating synthetic compounds with desired physical, chemical and/or bioactive properties, i.e., active compounds, are provided. During iterations of the processes, a target nucleic acid sequence is provided or selected, and a library of candidate nucleobase sequences is generated in silico according to defined criteria. A "virtual" oligonucleotide chemistry is chosen and a library of virtual oligonucleotide compounds having the selected nucleobase sequences is generated. These virtual compounds are reviewed and compounds predicted to have particular properties are selected. The selected compounds are robotically synthesized and are preferably robotically assayed for a desired physical, chemical or biological activity. Active compounds are thus generated and, at the same time, preferred sequences and regions of the target nucleic acid that are amenable to oligonucleotide or sequence-based modulation are identified.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system of associated components for preparing a set of oligonucleotides that modulates expression of a selected nucleic acid comprising: a computer system that i) generates a list of oligonucleotide sequences according to a desired oligonucleotide length, thereby generating a series of oligonucleotide sequences; ii) applies a virtual oligonucleotide chemistry to the oligonucleotide sequences generated in step i) to yield a set of virtual oligonucleotides; iii) generates a subset of said set of virtual oligonucleotides, said subset being the result of a decision to target a functional region of said selected nucleic acid; and iv) generates synthesis instructions in computer manipulable form for said oligonucleotide sequences in said subset of said set of virtual oligonucleotides; an automated synthesizer that receives said synthesis instructions from said computer system and synthesizes only said oligonucleotide sequences in said subset of said set of virtual oligonucleotides, wherein the product of said synthesis is a set of synthesized oligonucleotides; and an apparatus that accepts said set of synthesized oligonucleotides and performs at least one procedure for each of said synthesized oligonucleotides wherein said procedure identifies particular members of said set that modulate expression of said selected nucleic acid. 2.
