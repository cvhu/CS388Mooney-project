A medical manipulator comprises a working unit (10) that performs operations, an operating unit (20) that generates instructions, a drive unit (50) that drives the working unit on the basis of instructions given thereto by the operating unit, a power transmission mechanism (60) for transmitting driving force of the drive unit to the working unit, and a control unit (40) for controlling the power transmission mechanism on the basis of instructions given thereto by the operating unit. The power transmission mechanism includes a first power transmission unit (61) interlocked with the drive unit, and a second power transmission unit (63) interlocked with the working unit and capable of being detachably connected to the first power transmission unit. A back drive torque of the first power transmission unit is larger than a back drive torque of the second power transmission unit.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A medical manipulator comprising: a working unit that performs operations; a drive unit that drives the working unit; and a power transmission mechanism for transmitting driving force of the drive unit to the working unit; wherein the power transmission mechanism includes: a first power transmission unit interlocked with the drive unit; a reduction device interposed between the drive unit and the first power transmission unit; and a second power transmission unit interlocked with the working unit and capable of being connected to and disconnected from the first power transmission unit. 2. The medical manipulator according to claim 1, wherein the reduction device includes a reduction gear. 3. The medical manipulator according to claim 1 further comprising an origin detecting means capable of being connected to and disconnected from the first power transmission unit in a state where the first power transmission unit is disconnected from the second power transmission unit and of detecting a predetermined connecting position for the first power transmission unit when connected to the first power transmission unit. 4. The medical manipulator according to claim 1 further comprising: an operating unit for producing operation instructions; and a control unit for controlling the drive unit on the basis of operation instructions given thereto by the operating unit. 5. The medical manipulator according to claim 4, wherein the control unit is initialized upon the connection of the medical manipulator to a power source, the control unit remains in a waiting state after initialization, the control unit periodically monitors instructions provided by an operator while the control unit is in the waiting state, the control unit controls the working unit such that the position of the working unit follows that of the operating unit and monitors at least an operation stop instruction and a return-to-origin instruction when an operation start instruction is given thereto in the waiting state, the control unit maintains a position of the working unit at a moment when the operation stop instruction is detected and remains in the waiting state when the operation stop instruction is given thereto, the control unit executes a return-to-origin operation upon the detection of the return-to-origin instruction to control the drive unit to set the working unit in an initial position in which the working unit is set when the control unit is initialized and holds the working unit in the initial position and remains in the waiting state after the working unit has been set in the initial position, the control unit makes a query to see whether or not an operation performed immediately before remaining in the waiting state is the return-to-origin operation when a system shutdown instruction is given thereto in the waiting state, the control unit decides that a normal operation is possible when it is determined that the operation performed immediately before remaining in the waiting state is the return-to-origin operation, and the control unit decides that the system shutdown instruction is given wrongly when it is determined that the operation performed immediately before remaining in the waiting state is not the return-to-origin operation. 6. The medical manipulator according to claim 4, wherein the working unit and the second power transmission unit are integrated in an assembly, the operating unit and the first power transmission unit are integrated in an assembly, and the assembly of the working unit and the second power transmission unit, and the assembly of the operating unit and the first power transmission unit can detachably connected together. 7. The medical manipulator according to claim 1, wherein a back drive torque of the first power transmission unit is larger than a drive torque of the second power transmission unit. 8. The medical manipulator according to claim 7, wherein the back drive torque of the first power transmission unit has a strength more than 0.05Nm when the first and the second power transmission unit are connected together. 9. A method of using the medical manipulator according to claim 1 when the medical manipulator is stopped in an emergency in a state where the working unit is inserted in a cavity of a surgical subject, said method comprising the steps of: removing at least the drive unit and the first power transmission unit; and extracting the working unit and the second power transmission unit from the cavity of the surgical subject. 10. A method of using the medical manipulator according to claim 1 when the medical manipulator is stopped in an emergency in a state where the working unit is inserted in a cavity of a surgical subject, said method comprising the steps of: removing at least the drive unit and the first power transmission unit; setting the working unit in a safe position by manually operating the second power transmission unit; and extracting the working unit and the second power transmission unit from the cavity of the surgical subject. 11. A method of using the medical manipulator according to claim 1 when the medical manipulator is stopped in an emergency in a state where the working unit is inserted in a cavity of a surgical subject, said method comprising the steps of: removing at least the drive unit and the first power transmission unit; and setting the working unit in a safe position by manually operating the working unit using a forceps; and extracting the working unit and the second power transmission unit from a cavity of a surgical subject. 12. A control method of controlling a medical manipulator including a working unit that performs operations, an operating unit that produces operation instructions, a drive unit that drives the working unit on the basis of operation instructions provided by the operating unit, and a control unit that controls the drive unit on the basis of operation instructions provided by the operating unit, said control method comprising: periodically monitoring instructions provided by an operator in a waiting state; controlling the working unit such that the position of the working unit follows that of the operating unit and monitoring at least an operation stop instruction and a return-to-origin instruction when an operation start instruction is given in the waiting state; maintains a position of the working unit at a moment when the operation stop instruction is detected and keeping the waiting state when the operation stop instruction is given; executing a return-to-origin operation upon the detection of the return-to-origin instruction to control the drive unit to set the working unit in an initial position in which the working unit is set when the control unit is initialized, and holding the working unit in the initial position and keeping the waiting state after the working unit has been set in the initial position; making a query to see whether or not an operation performed immediately before the start of the waiting state is the return-to-origin operation when a system shutdown instruction is detected in the waiting state; deciding that a normal operation is possible when it is determined that the operation performed immediately before the start of the waiting state is the return-to-origin operation; and deciding that the system shutdown instruction is given wrongly when it is determined that the operation performed immediately before starting the waiting state is not the return-to-origin operation.
