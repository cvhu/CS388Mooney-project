A numerically-controlled robotic manipulator arm mounted to a sod harvester comprises two segments pivotally coupled together. One segment is rotatably coupled to a fixed base on the harvester while the second segment carries a pick-up head which can turn with respect to the segment. The pick-up head is capable of picking up, holding, and releasing sod rolls. The arm is programmable so that a variety of configurations of stacked sod rolls can be achieved.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for cutting and stacking rolls of sod comprising: a chassis for traversing a sod field; a means for cutting a plurality of sod strips; an accumulator configured to hold the plurality of sod strips; a sod roller configured to roll the sod strips; a conveyor configured to transfer sod from the cutting mechanism to the accumulator; a robotic arm configured to lift the plurality of sod strips from the accumulator to a first sod storage location; and a controller configured to querying an operator for a predetermined sod stack configuration; the controller configured to set a first counter to a first initial condition indicative of a number of rolls of layers of sod; the controller configured to set a second counter to a second initial condition indicative of a number of rows of sod per layer; the controller configured to set a third counter to a third initial condition indicative of a number of rolls of sod per row; if the first counter is less than an first initial condition, the controller is configured to perform the following: if the second counter is less than a second initial condition, the controller is configured to perform the following: if the third counter is less than an third initial condition, the controller is configured to perform the following: enable the cutting means to cut a strip of sod, enable the sod roller to roll the sod, enable the conveyance of the sod roll to an accumulator belt, enable the indexing of the accumulator belt to receive another roll of sod, incrementing the third counter; instructing a robotic arm to pick up, a plurality of rolls of sod from the accumulator belt, instructing the robot arm to move the sod to a pallet, incrementing the second counter; incrementing the level of the pallet; and incrementing the first counter.
