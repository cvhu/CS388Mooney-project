A substrate storage container includes: a container body of a front open box type for holding a multiple number of semiconductor wafers supported in alignment by supporting ribs; a bottom plate removably attached to the bottom of the container body; and a pair of conveyor contact rails integrally formed along both the left and right sides of this bottom plate. These conveyor contact rails inhibit vibrations and impacts acting on the semiconductor wafers when the sealed container body is conveyed by a conveyor.

The substrate storage container according to claim 1, wherein the conveyor contact rails are arranged on the side portions or the front portion and rear portion of the bottom plate and both ends of the bottom surface of the conveyor contact rails are formed to be inclined upwards toward their respective ends. 6. The substrate storage container according to claim 5, wherein both side edges in the end portions of the conveyor contact rails are inclined so that each end of the conveyor contact rails gradually becomes wider from the non end to each end of the conveyor contact rails. 7. The substrate storage container according to claim 1, wherein an angle of inclination at both the front and rear ends of the conveyor contact rails is adjusted to 1 to 10 degrees. 8. The substrate storage container according to claim 1, wherein the position restraint member is integrated with the base plate so as to hold the base plate from front and rear surfaces. 9. A substrate storage container for storing substrates in a container body, comprising: a container body having an info pad plate in a rear portion, wherein the info pad plate is provided with a plurality of through holes, and a pair of conveyor contact rails integrally formed as part of the container body, a door element removably fitted with a sealing gasket interposed therebetween so as to open and close an opening of the container body, a front retainer for individually holding the substrates at their front peripheral edge being removably attached to the inner face of the door element, wherein each of the conveyor contact rails has a conveyor contact surface having a bottom that is formed as a smooth, flat plane and a difference between the maximum height and minimum height from a reference surface of the conveyor contact rail is 0.3 mm or smaller, whereby that the conveyor contact rails inhibit vibrations acting on substrates when the container body is transported by a conveyor, wherein the container body is configured of front-open box type that has a base plate with substrate supporting ribs arranged vertically on both sides therein and support the substrate horizontally; wherein the base plate includes a pair of position restraint members formed on a rear side and an interior side of the base plate where no supporting rib is provided, a plurality of projections that will come in area contact within 5 mm from the peripheral part of the undersurface of the substrate are formed on the top surface of each supporting rib so as to extend inwards from the outer side with respect to the width; and both side edges of each projection are inclined so that the projection gradually becomes narrower inwards from the outer side with respect to the width of the container body; wherein the supporting ribs are formed in an elongate shelf-like form with the base plate integrally formed with both interior side walls of the container body while a slip stopper projection is formed in a front end of a front side, and the projections for supporting the substrates are provided with a flat surface formed in an elongate trapezoidal form while the pair of position restraint members are provided at the rear of the supporting ribs so as to hold the base plate integrally from a front side and an underside, so that the base plate provided with the supporting ribs, the slip stopper projection and the position restraint members is formed integrally with both interior side walls of the container body; and each position restraint member is molded, essentially in an elongate plate form, of an abrasion resistant material different from that of the supporting ribs and integrated with the base plate, for regulating the inserted positions of the substrates. 10.
