Two or more telemanipulated surgical instruments are inserted through a guide tube. Each instrument has a transmission mechanism that transmits actuating forces from actuators to components of the instrument. The transmission mechanisms are arranged around an extended centerline of the guide tube and are wedge-shaped so that they can be positioned more closely to the extended centerline.
