A defined vehicle path emulator system is described, which system can be used for measuring the F-min values and profiles for a path on a concrete floor traversed by a vehicle with a specific wheelbase. The defined vehicle path emulator is an autonomous robot that guides itself down the selected path. The F-min values are used to calculate the deviations away from zero planar infinity while traversing the path for a tall mast carried by an emulated vehicle. This invention's systems are distinct from the (FF/FL) floor flatness and floor levelness measuring systems in the literature as prior art. The floor can be marked for deviations from flatness by means of a laser etching system activated by the emulator's software system. The emulator can also signal an operator when it detects itself veering off of the defined path.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. a vehicle mast angle emulator, the emulator comprised of a longitudinal boom, a short transverse boom, and a long transverse boom, the short transverse boom placed orthogonally at one end of the longitudinal boom, the long transverse boom placed orthogonally at the other end of the longitudinal boom, the short and long transverse booms each terminating in wheels, the long transverse boom possessing a transverse sensor, the long transverse boom also possessing a plurality of laser-etching devices, the longitudinal boom possessing a drive wheel housing at one end, an electronics housing on top, a computer system within the electronics housing, longitudinal sensors, and a distance encoder wheel, the drive wheel housing possessing a drive wheel, a drive motor, and a steering servo, the drive wheel housing having attached to it a guidance system, the guidance system comprised of a beam emitter and a beam sensor, the electronics housing containing an emulator control circuit board, a signal conditioner circuit board, a laser-etching computer, and a battery charger, the longitudinal boom and short and long transverse booms also each possessing a plurality of boom adjustment means, the short and long transverse booms adjustable to match the wheelbase width of material handling trucks, the laser etching computer possessing software that accepts inputs from the distance encoder wheel and the longitudinal sensors, the laser etching computer capable of computing with said software floor deviation magnitude away from planar infinity and directing the laser etching devices to mark the floor where the computer senses floor flatness deviation, the laser etching computer possessing sufficient on-board computer memory to store a complete record of the traverse by the emulator of a warehouse corridor.
