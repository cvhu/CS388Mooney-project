A method of controlling application of a substance to vegetation using data obtained via a mobile machine is provided. A height of the vegetation is measured during a scheduled task of the mobile machine. The measured height of the vegetation is compared with a calculated height of the vegetation. Then, an amount of the substance applied by an irrigation system to an area containing the vegetation is adjusted based on a difference between the measured height of the vegetation and the calculated height of the vegetation.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mobile machine comprising: a task payload system; a propulsion system; a steering system; a braking system; a sensor system for collecting data regarding an operating environment for the mobile machine; a monitoring system; and a machine controller coupled to the task payload system, the propulsion system, the steering system, the braking system, the sensor system, and the monitoring system; wherein the machine controller measures a height of the vegetation during a scheduled task of the mobile machine, compares the measured height of the vegetation with a calculated height of the vegetation, and adjusts an amount of the substance applied by an irrigation system to an area containing the vegetation based on a difference between the measured height of the vegetation and the calculated height of the vegetation, wherein the machine controller decreases the amount of the substance applied by the irrigation system to the area containing the vegetation in response to the measured height of the vegetation being greater than the calculated height of the vegetation. 2. A mobile machine comprising: a task payload system; a propulsion system; a steering system; a braking system; a sensor system for collecting data regarding an operating environment for the mobile machine; a monitoring system; and a machine controller coupled to the task payload system, the propulsion system, the steering system, the braking system, the sensor system, and the monitoring system; wherein the machine controller measures a height of the vegetation during a scheduled task of the mobile machine, compares the measured height of the vegetation with a calculated height of the vegetation, and adjusts an amount of the substance applied by an irrigation system to an area containing the vegetation based on a difference between the measured height of the vegetation and the calculated height of the vegetation, wherein the substance is a liquid. 3. The mobile machine of claim 2, wherein the liquid is at least one of water, fertilizer, pesticide, fungicide, nematicide, and herbicide. 4. A mobile machine comprising: a task payload system; a propulsion system; a steering system; a braking system; a sensor system for collecting data regarding an operating environment for the mobile machine; a monitoring system; and a machine controller coupled to the task payload system, the propulsion system, the steering system, the braking system, the sensor system, and the monitoring system; wherein the machine controller measures a height of the vegetation during a scheduled task of the mobile machine, compares the measured height of the vegetation with a calculated height of the vegetation, and adjusts an amount of the substance applied by an irrigation system to an area containing the vegetation based on a difference between the measured height of the vegetation and the calculated height of the vegetation, wherein the calculated height of the vegetation is at least one of a predicted height of the vegetation, a desired height of the vegetation, and a deviation from a value calculated from the measured height of the vegetation. 5. The mobile machine of claim 4, wherein the value calculated from the measured height of the vegetation used as the basis of the deviation is at least one of an average of the measured height of the vegetation, a median of the measured height of the vegetation, a percentile of the measured height of the vegetation, and a multiple of a standard deviation of the measured height of the vegetation. 6. A mobile machine comprising: a task payload system; a propulsion system; a steering system; a braking system; a sensor system for collecting data regarding an operating environment for the mobile machine; a monitoring system; and a machine controller coupled to the task payload system, the propulsion system, the steering system, the braking system, the sensor system, and the monitoring system; wherein the machine controller measures a height of the vegetation during a scheduled task of the mobile machine, compares the measured height of the vegetation with a calculated height of the vegetation, and adjusts an amount of the substance applied by an irrigation system to an area containing the vegetation based on a difference between the measured height of the vegetation and the calculated height of the vegetation, wherein the machine controller maps received environmental factors to past times in association with intervals between scheduled tasks of the mobile machine, receives current and future predictions of environmental factors, and adjusts a schedule of the irrigation system based on a calculated vegetation height to account for the environmental factors, wherein the mobile machine is aware of the schedule of the irrigation system; and wherein the machine controller adjusts the schedule of the irrigation system based on non-optically sensed changes in vegetation height by the mobile machine.
