A method of degrading a water-soluble, synthetic polymeric film being at least partially covered with a paint material. The method includes placing the film in an extractor apparatus and separating the paint material from the film. The paint material is collected from a water-based solution with a filtration media. The film is degraded in the extractor apparatus.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of degrading a water-soluble, synthetic polymeric film, the film being at least partially covered with a waste material, comprising: placing the film in an extractor apparatus; separating the waste material from the film by submerging the film in water having a temperature between 100.degree. F. and 250.degree. F.; collecting the waste material from the water with a PVOH filtration media, wherein the water has a temperature during the collection step of less than 100.degree. F.; and degrading the PVOH filtration media in water having a temperature between 100.degree. F. and 250.degree. F. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising directing high pressure steam or water at the film. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the separation step is performed under a pressure of about 20 psi or more. 4. The method of claim 1, further comprising agitating the film with water in the extractor apparatus. 5. The method of claim 1, further comprising exposing the film to a centrifugation process in the extractor apparatus. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the separation step comprises dissolving the film. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the collection step comprises collecting water-insoluble materials from the water. 8. The method of claim 1, further comprising filtering the water through a waste water treatment system. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the waste material comprises a paint material. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of degrading the PVOH filtration media comprises degrading the PVOH filtration media in a second extractor apparatus.
