The invention relates to methods and compositions for identifying maize plants that have newly conferred tolerance or enhanced tolerance to, or are susceptible to, Gray Leaf Spot (GLS). The methods use molecular genetic markers to identify, select and/or construct tolerant plants or identify and counter-select susceptible plants. Maize plants that display newly conferred tolerance or enhanced tolerance to GLS that are generated by the methods of the invention are also a feature of the invention.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Maize variety PHJEP, representative seed of said maize variety having been deposited as ATCC accession number PTA-8851. 2. A seed of the maize variety of claim 1. 3. A plant of the maize variety of claim 1. 4. A plant cell of the plant of claim 3. 5. A maize seed produced by crossing the plant of claim 3 with a second maize plant, wherein said maize seed comprises a PHJEP gray leaf spot tolerance locus and that, when grown, produces a plant that exhibits gray leaf spot tolerance. 6. The maize seed of claim 5, wherein said PHJEP gray leaf spot tolerance locus comprises the chromosomal region of PHJEP defined by UMC1346 and UMC1702. 7. The maize seed of claim 5, wherein the PHJEP gray leaf spot tolerance locus is defined by a haplotype comprising: a. a G at PHM 00045-01; b. an A at PHM 00043-01; c. an A at PHM 15534-13; d. a G at PHM 04694-10; e. a T at PHM 01811-32; f. a T at PHM 01963-15; g. a C at PHM 01963-22; h. a T at PHM 05013-12; i. a T at PHM 00586-10; and j. an A at PHM 00049-01. 8. The maize seed of claim 5, wherein said PHJEP gray leaf spot tolerance locus is defined by a haplotype comprising: a. a G at PHM 00045-01; b. an A at PHM 00043-01; c. a C at PHM 01963-22; and d. a T at PHM 05013-12. 9. The maize seed of claim 5, wherein said maize seed is a backcross conversion of the PHJEP gray leaf spot tolerance locus. 10. The maize seed of claim 9, wherein the backcross conversion was produced with a recurrent parent selected from PHVNV, PHW3Y, PHVRA, PHEWB, and PHWRC. 11. The maize seed of claim 5, wherein the maize seed is a hybrid variety, and at least one inbred parent of said hybrid variety is a backcross conversion of the PHJEP gray leaf spot tolerance locus into a recurrent parent selected from PHVNV, PHW3Y, PHVRA, PHEWB, and PHWRC. 12. A maize plant produced by growing the maize seed of claim 5. 13. A plant cell of the maize plant of claim 12.
