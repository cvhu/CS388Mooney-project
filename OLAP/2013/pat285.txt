Various embodiments described in the application relate to an apparatus, system, and method for generating, within a conduit, discrete volumes of one or more fluids that are immiscible with a second fluid. The discrete volumes can be used for biochemical or molecular biology procedures involving small volumes, for example, microliter-sized volumes, nanoliter-sized volumes, or smaller. The system can comprise an apparatus comprising at least one conduit operatively connected to one or more pumps for providing discrete volumes separated from one another by a fluid that is immiscible with the fluid(s) of the discrete volumes, for example, aqueous immiscible-fluid-discrete volumes separated by an oil.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method comprising: disposing an intake tip of an aspirating conduit in a fluid container comprising at least first and second fluids that are immiscible with one another and form layers in the fluid container, wherein the aspirating conduit comprises at least one inner tube and an outer tube; aspirating the first fluid through the intake tip and into the aspirating conduit; moving one of the intake tip and the fluid container up or down relative to the other until the intake tip is immersed in the second fluid in the fluid container; and aspirating the second fluid through the intake tip and into the aspirating conduit. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising then moving the one of the intake tip and the fluid container back until the intake tip is immersed in the first fluid and then aspirating the first fluid into the aspirating conduit. 3. The method of claim 2, further comprising then moving the one of the intake tip and the fluid container back until the intake tip is immersed in the second fluid and aspirating the second fluid into the aspirating conduit.
