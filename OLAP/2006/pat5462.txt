The following processing is performed when a line gang pickup head can simultaneously pick up a maximum of n (here, 4) components. First, groupings of components of the same type, out of all of the components to be optimized, are set as component tapes and the component tapes are arranged descending order of the number of components to produce a component histogram (406a). Next, a partial histogram (400), which is part of the component histogram (406a), is taken from the component histogram (406a), and is arranged at two-dimensional coordinates where a horizontal axis (the Z-axis) represents an arrangement of component cassettes and a vertical axis represents a number of pickup operations by the line gang pickup head. After this, the component tapes are lined up, by arranging the partial histograms (401a and 401b), so as to produce a diagram (406b) whose width (number of components) in the horizontal axis is n (=4).
