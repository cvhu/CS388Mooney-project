The present invention provides a system and single or multi-functional element device that can be inserted and temporarily placed or implanted into a structure having a lumen or hollow space, such as a subject's abdominal cavity to provide therewith access to the site of interest in connection with minimally invasive surgical procedures. The insertable device may be configured such that the functional elements have various degrees of freedom of movement with respect to orienting the functional elements or elements to provide access to the site from multiple and different orientations/perspectives as the procedure dictates, e.g., to provide multiple selectable views of the site, and may provide a stereoscopic view of the site of interest.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A device insertable into a structure having a lumen, comprising: a first housing: at least one functional element connected to the first housing for use during a minimal access procedure; and a securing element associated with the insertable device for removably securing the insertable device within the structure, wherein the at least one functional element is movably connected to the first housing, the device further comprising at least one actuating element connected to the first housing and the functional element for moving the functional element in relation to the first housing essentially inline with an elongated axis of the device, and further comprising a lead screw, a shuttle capable of moving along the elongated axis of the screw, wherein the functional element is mounted to the shuttle and the actuating element is a motor for providing longitudinal movement to the shuttle along the elongated axis. 2. A device insertable into a structure having a lumen, comprising: a first housing: at least one functional element connected to the first housing for use during a minimal access procedure; and a securing element associated with the insertable device for removably securing the insertable device within the structure, wherein the at least one functional element is movably connected to the first housing, the device further comprising at least one actuating element connected to the first housing and the functional element for moving the functional element in relation to the first housing essentially inline with an elongated axis of the device, and further comprising a plurality of functional elements, a corresponding number of motors for producing rotational movement, a corresponding number of lead screws and a corresponding number of shuttles capable of moving along the elongated axis, each shuttle comprising a threaded portion and a hole therein, wherein each functional element is mounted to its corresponding shuttle, and wherein each motor is connected to its corresponding lead screw for providing longitudinal movement to the shuttle along the elongated axis, and wherein each lead screw passes through a hole of another shuttle to provide a guide for the other shuttle. 3. The insertable device of claim 2, further comprising at least one actuating element mounted onto each shuttle for moving the functional elements in relation to the first housing essentially orthogonal to the elongated axis thereby allowing the functional elements to be retracted into and extracted from the first housing. 4. The insertable device of claim 3, wherein the plurality of actuating elements are capable of moving each of the functional elements independently of each other. 5. A device insertable into a structure having a lumen, comprising; a first housing; a second housing rotatably connected to the first housing; a plurality of camera elements each comprising an image sensor movably connected to the first housing; at least one actuating element connected to the first housing and the second housing for rotating the first housing in relation to the second housing; at least one actuating element connected to each of the camera elements for moving the camera element in relation to the first housing essentially orthogonal to an elongated axis of the device; and a securing element associated with the second housing for removably securing the device within the structure.
