In a friction agitation joining method, two plate-shaped joining members different in thickness, or first and second joining members, are abutted against each other with a level difference formed at upper surface sides thereof. A rotating probe of a joining tool is inserted into the butted portion of the first and second joining members from upper surface sides thereof. Joining-direction front sides of the first and second joining members with respect to the probe inserted position are pressed by first and second front pressing rollers, respectively, from the upper surface sides thereof. Furthermore, joining-direction lower sides of the first and the second joining members with respect to a probe inserted position from the upper surface sides are pressed by first and second lower pressing rollers, respectively, from the upper surface sides thereof. In this state, the butted portion is joined by the friction agitation joining method.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A friction agitation joining method for joining a first joining member and a second joining member butted against each other with a level difference formed at upper surface sides thereof by relatively moving said first and second joining members with respect to a rotating probe of ajoining tool inserted into a butted portion of said first and second joining members from said upper surface sides so that said probe advances along said butted portion, the method comprising: performing joining of said butted portion while pressing joining-direction forward sides of said first joining member and said second joining member with respect to a probe inserted position from said upper surface sides by a first forward pressing roller and a second forward pressing roller, respectively, wherein said joining of said butted portion is performed while pressing a joined butted portion of said first and second joining members from said upper surface sides by a third backward pressing roller with a tapered periphery. 2. The friction agitation joining method as recited in claim 1, wherein said periphery of said third backward pressing roller is cooled. 3. A friction agitation joining method for joining a first joining member and a second joining member butted against each other with a level difference formed at upper surface sides thereof by relatively moving said first and second joining members with respect to a rotating probe of ajoining tool inserted into a butted portion of said first and second joining members from said upper surface sides so that said probe advances along said butted portion, the method comprising: performing joining of said butted portion while pressing joining-direction forward sides of said first joining member and said second joining member with respect to a probe inserted position from said upper surface sides by a first forward pressing roller and a second forward pressing roller, respectively, wherein said first forward pressing roller and said second forward pressing roller are separate members, and wherein said joining of said butted portion is performed in a state in which an axis of at least one of rollers including said first forward pressing roller and said second forward pressing roller is inclined with respect to a butting direction of said joining members within a plane perpendicular to a joining direction. 4. A friction agitation joining method for joining a first joining member and a second joining member butted against each other with a level difference formed at upper surface sides thereof by relatively moving said first and second joining members with respect to a rotating probe of a joining tool inserted into a butted portion of said first and second joining members from said upper surface sides so that said probe advances along said butted portion, the method comprising: performing joining of said butted portion while pressing joining-direction forward sides of said first joining member and said second joining member with respect to a probe inserted position from said upper surface sides by a first forward pressing roller and a second forward pressing roller, respectively, wherein said first forward pressing roller and said second forward pressing roller are separate members, and wherein said joining of said butted portion is performed while changing at least one of an inclination angle of an axis of said first forward pressing roller with respect to a butting direction of said first joining member within a plane perpendicular to a joining direction and an inclination angle of an axis of said second forward pressing roller with respect to said butting direction of said second joining member within a plane perpendicular to a joining direction based on a measured value of a characteristic concerning a joint state of a joined butted portion of said first and second joining members. 5. A friction agitation joining method for joining a first joining member and a second joining member butted against each other with a level difference formed at upper surface sides thereof by relatively moving said first and second joining members with respect to a rotating probe of a joining tool inserted into a butted portion of said first and second joining members from said upper surface sides so that said probe advances along said butted portion, the method comprising: performing joining of said butted portion while pressing joining-direction forward sides of said first joining member and said second joining member with respect to a probe inserted position from said upper surface sides by a first forward pressing roller and a second forward pressing roller, respectively, wherein said first forward pressing roller and said second forward pressing roller are separate members, and wherein said joining of said butted portion is performed in a state in which an axis of at least one of rollers including said first forward pressing roller and said second forward pressing roller is inclined with respect to a butting direction of said joining members within a plane parallel to upper surfaces of said joining members so that force in a butting direction is given to said joining members.
