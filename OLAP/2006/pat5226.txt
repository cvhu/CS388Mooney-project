Apparatus and methods for unloading and binding brick or other components include an infeed conveyor that delivers layers of brick to a transfer distribution carriage. The distribution carriage repositions the brick layers on either an outfeed conveyor or a tine conveyor. The layers of bricks carried by the outfeed conveyor are moved to where a tine layer is positioned on their upper surface. The tine conveyor divides the bricks into an arrangement of rows spaced apart to define openings for receiving a lifting or moving member, so that when the tine layer is positioned in a completed stack, enables movement of the stack by a forklift or other suitable moving means. Additional layer or layers are then positioned on the tine row on a packaging conveyor so that completed stacks are delivered to a package station that binds the stack of bricks or other components into an integrated structure.
