Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: a) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the polypeptide has phosphatidyl-glycerolphosphate synthase activity; b) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence which is at least 95% identical to a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts of the plasmids deposited with ATCC as Patent Deposit Numbers PTA-2011 or PTA-2340, wherein the polypeptide has phosphatidyl-glycerolphosphate synthase activity; c) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2; and d) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts of the plasmids deposited with ATCC as Patent Deposit Numbers PTA-2011 or PTA-2340. 2. The polypeptide of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 95% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the polypeptide has phosphatidyl-glycerolphosphate synthase activity. 3. The polypeptide of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence which is at least 95% identical to a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts of the plasmids deposited with ATCC as Patent Deposit Numbers PTA-2011 or PTA-2340, wherein the polypeptide has phosphatidyl-glycerolphosphate synthase activity. 4. An isolated polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. 5. An isolated polypeptide which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts of the plasmids deposited with ATCC as Patent Deposit Numbers PTA-2011 or PTA-2340. 6.
