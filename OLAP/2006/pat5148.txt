An information processing apparatus includes a first recurrent neural network (RNN) for performing processing which corresponds to a time-series and a second RNN for processing another correlated time-series. The difference between a context set output by the first RNN and a context set output by the second RNN is computed by a subtractor, and the obtained difference is used as a prediction error. Backpropagation is performed based on the prediction error, thus determining a coefficient for each neuron of an output layer, an intermediate layer, and an input layer.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An information processing apparatus comprising: a first recurrent neural network; a second recurrent neural network; prediction error generating means for generating a prediction error based on a difference between an output of said first recurrent neural network and said second recurrent neural network; and coefficient determining means for determining a coefficient by performing a backpropagation based on said prediction error in order to minimize said prediction error, wherein said prediction error determines said coefficient for each neuron of an output layer, an intermediate layer and an inner layer of said first recurrent neural network and said second recurrent neural network, wherein one of said first recurrent neural network and said second recurrent neural network learns based on a context output by the other recurrent neural network and said second recurrent neural network performs speech recognition processing.
