A capacitor is described. The capacitor includes a case chamber. An electrode stack assembly is disposed within the case chamber. The electrode stack assembly includes a layer. The layer includes an anode subassembly. The anode subassembly comprises at least one anode layer that has an anode edge disposed at a first distance from an interior wall of the case chamber. The layer also includes a capacitor layer. The capacitor layer includes a cathode edge disposed at a second distance from the wall interior. The second distance is greater than the first distance.
Claims We claim: 1. A capacitor comprising: a case chamber; an electrode stack assembly disposed within the case chamber, the electrode stack assembly includes a layer, the layer comprises: an anode subassembly comprising at least one anode layer having an anode edge disposed at a first distance from an interior wall of the case chamber; and a capacitor layer which includes a cathode edge disposed at a second distance from the wall interior, the second distance greater than the first distance.
