The invention relates to a method for identifying inherited point mutations in a targeted region of the genome in a large population of individuals and determining which inherited point mutations are deleterious, harmful or beneficial. Deleterious mutation are identified directly by a method of recognition using the set of point mutations observed in a large population of juveniles. Harmful mutations are identified by comparison of the set of point mutation observed in a large set of juveniles and a large set of aged individuals of the same population. Beneficial mutations are similarly identified.
