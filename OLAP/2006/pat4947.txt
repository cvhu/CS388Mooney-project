The compound of claim 1 wherein said compound is 15 to 30 nucleobases in length. 3. The compound of claim 1 wherein said compound is an oligonucleotide. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein said compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 5. The compound of claim 3 wherein said compound is a DNA oligonucleotide. 6. The compound of claim 3 wherein said compound is an RNA oligonucleotide. 7. The compound of claim 3 wherein said compound is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 8. The compound of claim 1 comprising at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety, or nucleobase. 9. The compound of claim 1 comprising at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 10. The compound of claim 1 comprising at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 11. The compound of claim 1 comprising at least one 5-methylcytosine. 12. An antisense oligonucleotide 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (SEQ ID NO: 4), said compound having at least 90% identity with SEQ ID NO: 47. 13. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 12 which is 19, 20 or 21 nucleobases in length, said antisense oligonucleotide having at least 95% identity with SEQ ID NO: 47. 14. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 12 which is a DNA oligonucleotide. 15. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 12 which is an RNA oligonucleotide. 16. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 12 which is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 17.
