A system is provided for qualifying a stack of generally flat, paper, cardboard, and the like. The system includes a robotic mechanism having a plurality of joints that provide varying degrees of motion and a robotic implement attachable to the robotic mechanism. The robotic mechanism is operable to articulate the robotic implement through various degrees of angular and linear motion. The robotic implement includes a first support barrier, a second support barrier disposed in generally parallel relation with the first support barrier, and a third support barrier extending between the first and second support barriers and connecting the first and second support barriers therewith. Together, the first, second and third support barriers form an open cross-section that defines a bay for supporting the stack. The cross-section includes an open side opposite the third support barrier for receiving an unqualified stack and dispensing a qualified stack. The system further includes a qualifying frame having an overhead generally horizontal wall for qualifying a first side of the stack, a first generally vertical wall, and a moveable second generally vertical wall disposed opposite the first vertical wall. The second vertical wall is moveable in the direction of the first vertical wall to qualify a second side of the stack adjacent the first side. The horizontal wall, first vertical wall, and second vertical wall further define a qualifying zone of the frame that is configured to receive the robotic implement and the unqualified stack. The robotic implement may be moved vertically within the qualifying zone to qualify the first side by engaging the stack with the horizontal wall. Further, the second vertical wall may be moved to engage the stack within the qualifying zone and to qualify the second side of the stack, thereby qualifying the stack.
