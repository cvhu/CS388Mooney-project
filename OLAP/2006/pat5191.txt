A method for allowing a robot to avoid objects along a programmed path: first, a field of view for an electronic imager of the robot is established along a path where the electronic imager obtains the object location information within the field of view; second, a population coded control signal is then derived from the object location information and is transmitted to the robot; finally, the robot then responds to the control signal and avoids the detected object.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for avoiding objects along a path programmed into a robot comprising the following steps in the order named: (a) establishing a field of view for an electronic imager of said robot along said path, (b) obtaining object location information in said field of view, (c) deriving a population coded control signal from said object location information by, processing a population coded motion energy algorithm that decomposes a video stream of said object location information into spatial and temporal frequency components, processing a population coded velocity algorithm that recombines said spatial and temporal frequency components corresponding to said object and provides a velocity output, thereby identifying how said object is moving in said field of view, processing a population coded rotation algorithm that determines if said electronic imager is turning and provides a turning information output, processing a population coded translation algorithm that transforms said velocity output of said velocity algorithm into a speed signal and calculates a distance between said object and said electronic imager providing a strategic control vector and a tactical control vector, processing a population coded navigation algorithm where said strategic control vector, said tactical control vector, and said turning information output are used to derive said population coded control signal, and (d) transmitting said population coded control signal to said robot, thereby allowing said robot to avoid said object. 2. A method for deriving a distance from an object to an electronic imager comprising the following steps in the order named: (a) establishing a field of view for said electronic imager, (b) obtaining object location information in said field of view, (c) deriving said distance from said object to said electronic imager by, processing a population coded motion energy algorithm that decomposes a video stream of said object location information into spatial and temporal frequency components, processing a population coded velocity algorithm that recombines said spatial and temporal frequency components corresponding to said object and provides a velocity output, thereby identifying how said object is moving in said field of view, and processing a population coded translation algorithm that transforms said velocity output of said velocity algorithm into a speed signal and calculates said distance between said object and said electronic imager.
