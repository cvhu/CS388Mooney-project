The invention provides novel polynucleotides isolated from cDNA libraries of human fetal liver-spleen and fetal liver as well as polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides. The polypeptide is a human chemokine receptor that is a member of a family of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains. Other aspects of the invention include vectors containing polynucleotides of the invention and related host cells as well a processes for producing chemokine receptor polypeptides, and antibodies specific for such polypeptides.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antibody or antibody fragment thereof that specifically binds to a transmembrane polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. 2. An antibody or antibody fragment thereof that specifically binds to a transmembrane polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO:2. 3. The antibody or antibody fragment of claim 1 or 2 which is a monoclonal antibody or antibody fragment thereof. 4. The antibody or antibody fragment of claim 1 or 2 which comprises a detectable label. 5. A kit comprising (a) the antibody or antibody fragment of claim 1 or 2 and (b) a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or a fragment thereof which is immunologically reactive with said antibody or antibody fragment. 6. A method of detecting the presence in a sample of a transmembrane polypeptide obtainable after expressing SEQ ID NO:2 in a suitable host cell, said method comprising: incubating said sample with an antibody or fragment of claim 1 or 2 under condition which permit the formation of an antibody/polypeptide complex and detecting the presence of an antibody/polypeptide complex, wherein the presence of the antibody/polypeptide complex indicates the presence of said transmembrane polypeptide.
