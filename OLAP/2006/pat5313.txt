A Microscope Imaging System (CMIS) with intelligent controls is disclosed that provides techniques for scanning, identifying, detecting and tracking microscopic changes in selected characteristics or features of various surfaces including, but not limited to, cells, spheres, and manufactured products subject to difficult-to-see imperfections. The practice of the present invention provides applications that include colloidal hard spheres experiments, biological cell detection for patch clamping, cell movement and tracking, as well as defect identification in products, such as semiconductor devices, where surface damage can be significant, but difficult to detect. The CMIS system is a machine vision system, which combines intelligent image processing with remote control capabilities and provides the ability to auto-focus on a microscope sample, automatically scan an image, and perform machine vision analysis on multiple samples simultaneously.
Claims What I claim is: 1. A method for examining specimens comprising the steps of: a) providing a video microscope having a holder for specimens and a camera located so as to be focused on said holder and providing an output representative of the electronic image of said specimen; b) providing a light source operatively connected to said video microscope for illuminating said specimens being held in said holder; c) providing a robotic system responsive to electrical signals and operatively connected to and for positioning said video microscope; d) providing a computer having a display terminal and operatively connected to said output of said camera and providing said electrical signals to said robotic system, said computer having operating programs comprising routines for providing machine vision techniques for scanning, identifying, detecting and tracking and displaying on said display terminal selected characteristics and features of said specimen, wherein said routines for providing machine vision techniques comprise a routine for cell identification and classification including metrics/statistics of one or more cells within an electronic image comprising the steps of: a) placing said one or more cells comprising a specimen in said holder; b) causing said video microscope having a camera to generate a series of electronic images of said specimen; c) generating a histogram having bars which are proportional to the values of the intensity of the series of generated electronic images; d) performing a Sobel filtering operation of said histogram so as to highlight the edges of the changes in intensity of said histogram; e) performing a threshold algorithm having a predetermined cut-off value on said histogram having said Sobel filtering so as to eliminate relatively small intensity changes of said histogram having said Sobel filtering; f) causing said video microscope to generate an electronic image of said specimen; g) performing a variance(s) filtering operation of said electronic image of said step f) wherein the variance, s, is computed as: .times..times..times. ##EQU00005## where N is the number of pixels occupying neighborhoods and {overscore (x)} is the average number of pixels in each neighborhood and wherein said pixels include a center pixel; h) examining the variance of the neighborhood of the center pixel and establishing the color of its center and if the variance is below a first predetermined variance then setting the color of its center pixel to a color black, but if the variance is above a second predetermined variance the color of its center pixel is left unchanged; i) combining said histogram of said step e) with the colored or unchanged colored center pixel of step h); j) performing a find particles technique to identify all the non-background objects in said combined histogram and colored or uncolored center pixel; k) performing an overlap on said combined histogram and colored or uncolored center pixel of said step j) so as to block out background objects thereof; l) analyze said non-background objects to produce metrics thereof; and m) comparing said produced metrics against known metrics so as to identify and classify said one or more cells. 2. The method according to claim 1, wherein said metrics of said identified and classified one or more cells comprise their major axis, minor axis, area, elongation, roundness, theta which represents an orientation with respect to a predetermined coordinate, thinness, and whether the object of the respective one or more cells being examined is within the field of view of said camera of said video microscope or only partially contained within the field of view of said camera of said video microscope.
