A robot apparatus 1 is to be electrically charged autonomously. An electrical charging device 100 is provided with two markers, namely a main marker 118 and a sub-marker 119, and the heights of the markers are pre-stored in the robot apparatus. When the robot apparatus 1 is to find the direction and the distance to the electrical charging device 100, a CCD camera 20 finds the direction vector of the marker from the photographed image. This direction vector is transformed into a position vector of a camera coordinate system {c} and further into a position vector of the robot coordinate system {b}. The coordinate in the height-wise direction in the robot coordinate system {b} is compared to the pre-stored height to find the distance between the markers and the robot apparatus and the direction of the robot apparatus.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an electrical charging system including a robot apparatus and an electrical charging device, said robot apparatus having movement means and a built-in power supply unit for driving and adapted for acting autonomously responsive to an inner state, a recording medium having recorded thereon a program for allowing said robot apparatus to execute charging processing of electrically charging said power supply unit, said program comprising: an imaging step of imaging a surrounding state; a position vector calculating step of calculating the distance and direction to at least one marker from an image of said marker provided to an electrical charging device, photographed by said imaging step, and from the pre-stored information on said marker; and a movement controlling step of performing control by driving said movement means to cause movement of said robot apparatus towards said electrical charging device depending on the distance and direction to said marker calculated by said position vector calculating steps, wherein said at least one marker comprises a main marker and a sub marker, the main marker is provided at an uppermost location of the electrical charging device and the sub marker is provided at a rear end of the electrical charging device.
