An apparatus comprises a body having a torus skin with inner and outer layers, and a drive system configured to propel the apparatus by moving the inner layer relative to the outer layer. The active skin propulsion system allows movement and steering of a device. A drive system includes a plurality of drive segments coupled together so that the skin engaging unit of the drive segment frictionally moves the inner layer of the torus skin relative to the outer layer of the torus skin. As a result of the relative skin motion and contact with the surface by the outer layer of the torus skin, the body is propelled and may be steered.
Claims We claim: 1. An apparatus comprising: a body having a skin, a plurality of segments, and a plurality of couplings dispensed between the segments; means for moving the skin of the body: means for moving the segments relative to each other that includes a skin engaging unit having a drive wheel and a friction imparting ring; and means for steering the body wherein the relative distance between the skin engaging units is varied and the skin is tensioned. 2. An apparatus comprising: a body, having a mechanically drivable toroidal skin, a propulsion system for moving the skin, and opposing first and second ends; a head coupled to said first end; and a tail coupled to said second end through a selectively releasable electric interlock, wherein the interlock is configured to permit disengagement for releasing the tail from the body. 3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the coupled head is movable relative to the body. 4. The apparatus of claim 2, further including a flexible cable attached to the tail for transferring power to the propulsion system. 5. The apparatus of claim 2, further comprising a means for collecting objects. 6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the means for collecting objects comprises any one of a scoop, a suction device, and a grasping device.
