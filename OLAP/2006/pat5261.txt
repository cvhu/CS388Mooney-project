A robot apparatus 1 is to be electrically charged autonomously. An electrical charging device 100 is provided with two markers, namely a main marker 118 and a sub-marker 119, and the heights of the markers are pre-stored in the robot apparatus. When the robot apparatus 1 is to find the direction and the distance to the electrical charging device 100, a CCD camera 20 finds the direction vector of the marker from the photographed image. This direction vector is transformed into a position vector of a camera coordinate system {c} and further into a position vector of the robot coordinate system {b}. The coordinate in the height-wise direction in the robot coordinate system {b} is compared to the pre-stored height to find the distance between the markers and the robot apparatus and the direction of the robot apparatus.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electrical charging system including a robot apparatus and an electrical charging device, said robot apparatus having built-in a power supply unit for driving and adapted for acting autonomously responsive to an inner state, said electrical charging device electrically charging said power supply unit, wherein said electrical charging device includes at least one marker provided at a predetermined position; said robot apparatus including imaging means for imaging a surrounding state and movement means to move said robot apparatus; storage means having the information on the position of said marker pre-stored therein; position vector calculating means for calculating the distance and the direction to said marker from the information on said marker position stored in said storage means and from an image including the marker position, photographed by said imaging means; and operation controlling means for performing control for driving said movement means, causing movement of said robot apparatus towards said electrical charging device depending on the distance and the direction to said marker calculated by said position vector calculating means; wherein said at least one marker comprises a main marker and a sub marker, the main marker is provided at an uppermost location of the electrical charging device and the sub marker is provided at a rear end of the electrical charging device.
