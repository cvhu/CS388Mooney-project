The method of claim 129, further comprising coupling a motor to the propulsion device, wherein the motor is configured to power the propulsion device. 136. The method of claim 129, further comprising coupling a bubble generator to the support member such that at least one feature of the bubbles is varied as a function of the speed at which the rotatable portion is rotated. 137. The method of claim 129, further comprising coupling a smoke generator to the support member such that at least one feature of the smoke is varied as a function of the speed at which the rotatable portion is rotated.
