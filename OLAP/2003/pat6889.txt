A legged robot is provided with a plurality of basic motion programs. The legged robot can produce a teaching motion program for performing a series of expressive motions by recognizing and language-processing instructions from a user in the form of voice-input, and extracting and combining at least one basic motion in a time series. More sophisticated and complex teaching programs can be edited by controlling the produced teaching motion programs stored in a database and combining the teaching motion programs with the basic motion programs.
