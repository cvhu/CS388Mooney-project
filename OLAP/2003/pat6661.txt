The invention relates to a device or method to determine the phenomenological regularity of the phase modulation of one or more cyclically fluctuating quantities, including the possibility to determine a regularity induced by mutual interaction. According to the invention, the regularity is determined as an autoregressive model of successive phase angles which are each defined as homogenous function of a low number of successive values of each of the cyclically fluctuating quantities. The periodicity of all functions of such phase angles permits an efficient approximation of the regularity by finite Fourier series. A skilled choice of the homogenous function (canonical phase) as well as of a related implicit estimation scheme guarantees that a good approximation of the angle dynamics results also in good reconstructions of the original dynamics. The estimated Fourier approximated Invertibility supporting Phase-Space maps (FIPS maps) can be used for prediction and/or control as well as for the identification and characterization of phase synchronized technical or scientific processes. The characterization of the mutual cross impact includes a distinction of the direction of the interaction.
