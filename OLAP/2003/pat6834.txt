Luciferase enzymes with greatly increased thermostability, e.g., at least half lives of 2 hours at 50.degree. C., cDNAs encoding the novel luciferases, and hosts transformed to express the luciferases, are disclosed. Methods of producing the luciferases include recursive mutagenesis. The luciferases are used in conventional methods, some employing kits.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A luciferase having an amino acid sequence comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:17, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:44, SEQ ID NO:45, and a portion thereof which has the luminescent activity of SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:17, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:44, SEQ ID NO:45. 2. A luciferase having an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:44, or SEQ ID NO:45. 3. A thermostable beetle luciferase that retains at least 50% activity in aqueous solution for at least 2 hours at a temperature of about 50.degree. C., which thermostable beetle luciferase comprises at least one amino acid substitution relative to a reference beetle luciferase, and which comprises SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:44, or SEQ ID NO:45. 4. A fusion protein comprising the luciferase of claim 3. 5. A solid substrate comprising the luciferase of claim 1, 2 or 3. 6. A fusion protein comprising the luciferase of claim 1 or 2. 7. A kit comprising: a container comprising the luciferase of claim 1, 2 or 3. 8. The kit of claim 7 wherein the container comprises an aqueous mixture comprising the luciferase. 9. The kit of claim 7 wherein the container comprises lyophilized luciferase. 10. The kit of claim 7 further comprising a container comprising luciferin. 11. The kit of claim 7 wherein the container further comprises luciferin. 12. The kit of claim 10 wherein the container comprising luciferin comprises lyophilized luciferin. 13. The kit of claim 11 wherein the luciferin comprises lyophilized luciferin. 14. The kit of claim 7 further comprising packaging material enclosing, separately packaged, the container and instruction means directing the user to correlate the luciferase activity in a sample with the level of ATP in the sample. 15. The kit of claim 7 further comprising packaging material enclosing, separately packaged, the container and instruction means directing the user to correlate the luciferase activity in a sample with the level or presence of an agent in the sample that alters the level of ATP in the sample. 16. The kit of claim 7 further comprising packaging material enclosing, separately packaged, the container and instruction means directing the user to correlate the luciferase activity in a sample with the level or presence of a molecule other than ATP.
