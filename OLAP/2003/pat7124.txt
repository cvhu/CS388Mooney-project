An air driven vibrator is attached to a robotic applicator for sealants and adhesives. When the plane of vibration is normal to the axis of the dispenser, the vibration will impart a rotary motion to the applicator. When the plane of vibration is parallel to the axis of the dispenser and normal to the direction of motion of the dispenser (such dispensers are usually robot mounted), a side-to-side or pendulum action is provided. When the dispense tip is provided with a static mixer to mix plural component materials, the vibrator will enhance the mixer's action.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An orbital dispenser for application of viscous materials, said dispenser comprising: a fixed mounting point; a dispense tube having a longitudinal axis and extending from said mounting point; and a rotary vibrator mounted to said tube remote from said fixed mounting point to induce lateral vibration therein relative to said longitudinal axis and said fixed mounting point to produce a swirl pattern of the material being dispensed. 2. The orbital dispenser of claim 1 wherein said rotary vibrator vibrates in a plane normal to said longitudinal axis. 3. The orbital dispenser of claim 1 wherein said rotary vibrator vibrates in a plane parallel to said longitudinal axis. 4. The orbital dispenser of claim 1 further comprising a pressurized source of viscous materials connected to said dispense tube. 5. The orbital dispenser of claim 1 further comprising: a plurality of pressurized sources of viscous materials connected to said dispense tube; and a static mixer located in said dispense tube, said vibrator serving to enhance the mixing action in said static mixer.
