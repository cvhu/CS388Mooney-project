Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Her-2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Her-2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Her-2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Her-2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound targeted to a nucleic acid encoding Her-2, wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with nucleobases that encode said Her-2 nucleic acid and wherein said compound inhibits the expression of human Her-2 and consists of SEQ ID NO: 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 28, 25, 14, 19, 17, 13, 46, 40, 38 or 35. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide consists of SEQ ID NO: 10, 15, 18, 21, 27, 29, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45 or 48. 4. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Her-2 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Her-2 is inhibited. 15. An antisense compound consisting of SEQ ID NO: 16, 23, 24 or 26.
