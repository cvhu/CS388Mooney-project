System for the manufacture of reinforcing preforms for structural composite products. The air flows for the manufacturing stations are optimized by providing a separate air system for each cell and providing seals between the net-edge blocks and the mold portions.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for the manufacture of reinforcing preforms for structural composite molding, comprising: at least one mold for making a preform, said mold comprising a first mold member and a second mold member; an air supply system for supplying air to said mold; at least one robotic member for supplying chopped reinforcing materials to said at least one mold; a material supply system for providing string reinforcing materials to said at least one robotic member; a plurality of net-edge block members positioned on said first mold member and providing a peripheral edge form for the preform; a first air sealing member positioned between said net-edge block members and said first mold member; and a second air sealing member positioned between said net-edge block members and said second mold member. 2. The system as recited in claim 1 further comprising a second mold for making a preform and a second air supply system for supplying air to said second mold, and wherein said at least one robotic member supplies chopped reinforcing materials to both of said at least one mold and said second mold. 3. The system as recited in claim 2 further comprising a second plurality of net-edge block members positioned in said second mold and providing a peripheral edge form for a second preform, and a second pair of air sealing members providing air seals between said second plurality of net-edge block members and said second mold. 4. The system as recited in claim 2 wherein said first and second air sealing members are each made from an elastomeric material.
