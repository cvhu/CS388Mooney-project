This invention pertains to the field of cancer genetics and cytogenetics. In particular, this invention pertains to the identification of a novel amplicon on human chromosome 20 which is associated with cancer. More particularly this invention pertains to the identification of a novel "amplicon" or genomic nucleic acid in a region of amplification at about 20q13.2 which has been associated with a variety of cancers, particularly breast cancer. The novel amplicon of the invention can be used as a probe specific for this region of 20q13.2 as well as for the diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers. Also provided are kits for screening for the presence and copy number of the novel amplicon of the invention in a sample containing human nucleic acid.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for screening for the presence or absence of an amplicon in a sample of human nucleic acid, the method comprising: providing a sample of nucleic acid derived from a human cell; providing a probe, wherein the probe hybridizes specifically to a chromosomal region from D20S211 through D20S120 under wash conditions that include 0.2.times.SSC at 65.degree. C.; contacting the human nucleic acid with the probe, wherein the probe is contacted with the human nucleic acid under conditions in which the probe binds selectively under stringent conditions to the human nucleic acid to form a hybridization complex; and detecting the formation of the hybridization complex to confirm the presence or absence of the amplicon. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the human nucleic acid is a genomic DNA. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of detecting the hybridization complex further comprises determining the copy number of the amplicon. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the human nucleic acid is isolated from a breast tumor cell. 5.

The method of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises nucleic acid which hybridizes specifically to a Genome Database (GDB) locus nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of D20S211, D20S854, D20S876, D20S1044, D20S913, D20S720, and D20S120. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises nucleic acid which hybridizes specifically to a cloned genomic nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of RMC20B4097, RMC20B4103, RMC20P4016, RMC20B4130, RMC20P4185, RMC20B4188, RMC20B4109, RMC20P4010, RMC20P4028, RMC20P4003, RMC20B4099, RMC20P4018, RMC20P4069, RMC20B4121, RMC20B4087, and RMC20P4070. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises a polymerase chain reaction primer pair which amplifies some or all of the nucleic acid sequence including from D20S211 through D20S120 and the detection step comprises detecting the formation of the polymerase chain reaction amplification reaction. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the polymerase chain reaction primer pair is a sequence tagged site (STS) PCR primer pair selected from the group consisting of AFMa233wg1, AFM080ya1, AFM069ya1, WI-16748, WI-9939, AFMa072zb9, WI-6578, AFM224zd12, WI-9227, and AFM276xh1. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the probe is attached to a solid surface. 11. The method of claim 10, wherein the attached probe is a member of a nucleic acid array. 12. The method of claim 1, wherein the human nucleic acid is labeled with a detectable composition. 13. The method of claim 12, wherein the detectable composition is fluorescein or Texas red. 14. The method of claim 1, wherein the probe is labeled with a detectable composition. 15.
