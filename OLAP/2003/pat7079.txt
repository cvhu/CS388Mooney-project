A method for assembling a slider suspension assembly for use in a disk drive is disclosed. A ceramic slider with an attached recording head is placed on a suspension and is held in alignment by soldering the electrical connections while the epoxy placed between the slider and the suspension hardens. The method results in a much more economical process which does not require the number of expensive tools needed to carry out the conventional process.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of assembling a slider suspension assembly for use in a magnetic recording device, comprising: placing a suspension having attached electrical leads in an alignment device; applying adhesive epoxy to said suspension; positioning a slider, having a head structure with attached metallic pads used for making electrical connections to said head structure, onto said suspension; making a solder connection between said electrical leads on said suspension and said pads on said head structure, and; removing the connected slider suspension assembly from said alignment device before said epoxy has hardened. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said alignment device is a fixture. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said alignment device is a robot machine. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein said solder connection is made by heating with a laser.
