A system for making a biochemical assay of each of plurality of provided specimens, comprising: a plurality of receptacles, a sensor for providing a resistance, a mechanism and a controller.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for making a biochemical assay of each of a plurality of provided specimens, the system comprising: a. a plurality of receptacles, each receptacle containing a respective specimen of the plurality of specimens, each receptacle comprising a surface for binding a paramagnetic particle to the surface; b. a detector for providing a resistance responsive to paramagnetic particle proximity to the detector in accordance with a giant magnetoresistive effect; c. a mechanism for positioning each respective surface in working proximity to the detector for providing a respective resistance; and d. a controller for controlling the mechanism and for recording indicia of each respective resistance; wherein the detector comprises a multiplicity of physically defined active areas for independent detecting of each of a corresponding multiplicity of specimens of the plurality of specimens; each active area comprises a plurality of sensors each sensor comprising an independent resistance responsive to paramagnetic particle proximity to the respective sensor in accordance with a respective giant magnetoresistive effect; and the controller further records indicia of each sensor; said plurality of sensors is arranged in an array coupled to a differential amplifier, said array is addressed by a row ring counter; and a column ring counter; each addressed cell is coupled in turn in a bridge circuit to said differential amplifier; said differential amplifier provides a signal that conveys indicia of the resistance of each sensor according to a sequence.
