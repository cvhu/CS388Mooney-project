In an apparatus for the transport of plates from a plate transport device to a plate storage rack or similar device, including a robotic arm having at its free end a plate engagement structure, the plate transport device is provided with a recess over which the plate can be centered and into which the plate engagement structure can be moved to engage the plate from the bottom side thereof and lift an remove the plate from the plate transport device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for the transport of plates from a plate transport device to a plate storage rack or similar device, including a robotic arm having a free end, a plate engagement structure comprising a suction frame provided with suction means arranged at the free end of said robotic arm for engaging a plate and removing it from said plate transport device, said plate transport device including a recessed area over which a plate on said plate transport device can be moved and which is adapted to receive said free end of said robotic arm with said plate engagement structure for the engagement of said plate from the bottom side thereof and for lifting and removing said plate from said plate transport device, said robotic arm having sufficient degrees of freedom of movement so that said suction frame can also be rotated to face downwardly and engage a plate from the top surface thereof and for moving said plate also in an essentially vertical position to a storage or transport rack.
