An off-line teaching apparatus comprises an operation command-receiving means for receiving an operation command inputted via an input/output port from a key input device or a coordinate input device and successively storing the operation command in a buffer; an operation command-reading means for successively reading the operation command stored in the buffer; an operation command-counting means for counting a number of operation commands stored in the buffer; and a confirmation sound-generating means for generating confirmation sound upon receipt of the operation, command by the operation command-receiving means when a counted value obtained by the operation command-counting means is not less than a predetermined number. Accordingly, the operator can be informed, in real time, of the fact that the system responds to the input of the operation command from the operator. Thus, it is possible to improve the operability of the off-line teaching.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An off-line teaching apparatus for allowing a robot model displayed on a monitor to act on a screen on the basis of an operation command supplied from an input device, the apparatus comprising: an operation command-receiving means for receiving said operation command from said input device; an action information-extracting means for deducing an operation point and a direction of action from said received operation command; a display form-reading means for reading display form information on said robot model from display orientation information on said robot model; an action attribute table registered with attributes of action corresponding to said display form and said operation point; and an action attribute-reading means for reading an attribute of action corresponding to said operation command from said action attribute table on the basis of an extracted operation point and read display form information wherein: said operation command is processed depending on said read attribute of action, wherein: said operation command from said input device is interpreted depending on an operation point and a display form of said robot model to make a response.
