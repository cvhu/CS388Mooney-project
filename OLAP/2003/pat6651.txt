Compounds, compositions and methods are provided for inhibiting Fas mediated signaling. The compositions comprise antisense compounds targeted to nucleic acids encoding Fas, FasL and Fap-1. Methods of using these antisense compounds for inhibition of Fas, FasL and Fap-1 expression and for treatment of diseases, particularly autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cancers, associated with overexpression or constitutive activation of Fas, FasL or Fap-1 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 20 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to the coding region of a nucleic acid molecule encoding FAS, wherein said antisense compound inhibits the expression of said FAS and has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 119, 124, 125, 127 or 128. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein modified nucleobase is a 5-methyl cytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of FAS in cells or tissues comprising contacting cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of FAS is inhibited.
