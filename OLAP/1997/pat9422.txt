A system and method for causing an autonomous vehicle to track a desired path uses reference postures to define the desired path. Actual vehicle postures are determined using sensors aboard the autonomous vehicle. An expected vehicle posture at the end of a next time interval is determined on the actual vehicle posture. A desired vehicle posture at the end of the next time interval is determined based on the reference postures. A steering angle for the next time interval for the autonomous vehicle is determined based on the difference between the reference posture and the desired vehicle posture at the end of the next time interval.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for causing an autonomous vehicle to track a desired path comprising the steps of: (1) determining reference postures at regular unit distances along the desired path, wherein said reference postures are packets of information about a particular location on the path including longitude, latitude, heading, curvature, maximum velocity, and distance to the next posture; (2) determining an actual vehicle posture; (3) determining an expected vehicle posture at a future time corresponding to a current planning time interval based on the actual vehicle posture; (4) determining a desired posture at the end of a next planning time interval based on the reference postures; (5) determining a steering angle from the expected vehicle posture and the desired posture; (6) commanding the vehicle to steer the determined steering angle; and (7) repeating steps 2 through 6. 2. A system for causing an autonomous vehicle to track a desired path comprising: (1) means for determining reference postures at regular unit distances along the desired path, wherein said reference postures are packets of information about a particular location on the path including longitude, latitude, heading, curvature, maximum velocity, and distance to the next posture; (2) means for determining an actual vehicle posture; (3) means for determining an expected vehicle posture at a future time corresponding to a current planning time interval based on the actual vehicle posture; (4) means for determining a desired posture at the end of a next planning time interval based on the reference postures; (5) means for determining a steering angle from the expected vehicle posture and the desired posture; and (6) means for commanding the vehicle to steer the determined steering angle. 3. A method for causing an autonomous vehicle to track a desired path, comprising the steps of: determining a plurality of reference postures along the desired path, said reference postures spaced apart at distances along the desired path, wherein a posture includes a position, a heading, and a curvature; determining a sensed posture of the vehicle, said sensed posture based on measurements from sensors aboard the vehicle; determining an expected posture at the end of a first time interval, said expected posture based on said sensed posture; determining a desired posture at the end of a next time interval, said desired posture based on said plurality of reference postures; determining a steering angle based on a difference between said expected posture and said desired posture; and commanding the vehicle to steer said steering angle to track the desired path. 4. A system for causing an autonomous vehicle to track a desired path, the system comprising: means for determining a plurality of reference postures along the desired path, said reference postures spaced apart at distances along the desired path, wherein a posture includes a position, a heading, and a curvature; means for determining a sensed posture of the vehicle, said sensed posture based on measurements from sensors aboard the vehicle; means for determining an expected posture at the end of a current planning time interval, said expected posture based on said sensed posture; means for determining a desired posture at the end of a next planning time interval, said desired posture based on said plurality of reference postures; means for determining a steering angle based on a difference between said expected posture and said desired posture; and means for commanding the vehicle to steer said steering angle to thereby track the desired path.
