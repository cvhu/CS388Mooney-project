A robot welding gun comprises a welding gun mounting bracket provided at the tip end of a robot arm, a cylinder unit incorporated in the bracket for adjusting the position of a fixed arm, a rod which is rotated or moved forward or backward by the cylinder unit and is connected to the fixed arm and a gun body which include the arm and is slidably mounted on the mounting bracket. As a result, it is possible to eliminate the variation of movement of the welding gun caused by the robot by adjusting the position of the welding gun relative to the fixed arm in accordance with the wearing amount of an electrode of the welding gun on the side of the fixed arm to always keep the same in contact with a surface of a weldment so as to provide a robot welding gun unit easy in control and capable of safe and accurate welding without generating distortion in the weldment.
Claims What is claimed is: 1.

The welding gun according to claim 1, wherein said cylinder unit is a rotating motor and said rod is drivingly interconnected by a bracket secured on said fixed arm, said bracket having an aperture therethrough for receiving said rod, said rod and said aperture of said bracket having cooperating threads engaged therebetween. 3. The welding gun according to claim 1, wherein said rod is drivingly interconnected by a bracket secured on said fixed arm and fixedly connected to said rod, said cylinder unit being a pressurized cylinder for selectively moving said rod. 4. The welding gun according to claim 1, wherein said gun body including means for moving said slidable rod forwardly toward the object to be welded while said fixed rod is fixedly restrained in said selected position to clamp the object between the first and second welding electrodes and rearwardly to release the object. 5. A robot welding gun which is a welding gun mounted on a robot arm of a robot comprising: a welding gun mounting bracket secured to the robot arm so as to move in conjunction with the robot arm; a gun body that includes a frame member, which has a front end and a rear end, and mounting means between said front and rear ends for slidably mounting said frame member of said gun body to said mounting bracket to facilitate forward and rearward sliding of said gun body, said gun body including a fixed arm which is fixed relative to said frame member and extends forwardly from said front end, said fixed arm terminating at a tip end which includes a rearward projecting first welding electrode, said gun body further including a slidable rod which is slidably mounted to said frame member, extends forwardly toward said tip end of said fixed arm, and includes a forward projecting second welding electrode, said gun body further including means for moving said slidable rod forwardly to clamp an object to be welded between said first and second welding electrodes and rearwardly to release the object; and an adjustment unit which is attached to said mounting bracket and includes a forward projecting adjustment rod with a distal end and a proximal end and adjusting auxiliary means for detecting wear to said first electrode, said adjustment unit including reversible actuating means engaged with said proximal end of said adjustment rod for selectively driving said adjustment rod in response to wear detected by said adjusting auxiliary means, said adjustment rod drivingly interconnected to said fixed arm at all times so that said fixed arm is reversibly driven both forwardly and rearwardly along a predetermined path to a selected position therealong in response to said driving of said adjustment rod and said fixed arm is forwardly and rearwardly restrained by said rod in said selected position when said rod is stopped. 6. The welding gun according to claim 5, wherein said actuating means is a motor for rotatably driving said adjustment rod, and said adjustment rod is drivingly interconnected by a bracket secured on said fixed arm, said bracket having an aperture therethrough for receiving said adjustment rod, said adjustment rod and said aperture of said bracket having cooperating threads engaged therebetween. 7. The welding gun according to claim 5, wherein said adjustment rod is drivingly interconnected by a bracket secured on said fixed arm and fixedly connected to said rod, said actuating means being a pressurized cylinder for selectively moving said rod forwardly and rearwardly. 8. The welding gun according to claim 5, wherein said welding gun has a welding state and a deactivated state, and wherein said adjusting auxiliary means detects wear to said first welding electrode when said welding gun is in said deactivated state. 9. A method for positioning electrodes on a robotic welding gun comprising the steps of, providing a welding gun including a frame, an adjustment means connected to said frame for moving a first arm fixed to said adjustment means, a first welding electrode on a distal end of said first arm, said first welding electrode having a tip at a predetermined position, a second arm with a second welding electrode at a distal end thereof, a motive means fixed to said frame for moving said second welding electrode into contact with an object to be welded thereby clamping the object to be welded between said first and second welding electrodes when said first and second electrodes are in an activated state; positioning a sensor near said first electrode when said first and second electrodes are in a deactivated state; sensing wear on said first welding electrode using said sensor; and repositioning said tip of said first welding electrode to compensate for wear thereon by activating said adjustment means, thereby adjusting said first arm and said tip of said first welding electrode so as to maintain said tip at said predetermined position without reorienting the entire robotic welding gun.
