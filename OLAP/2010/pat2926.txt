An apparatus and method of dynamically tracking a soft tissue target with ultrasound images, without the use of fiducial markers. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes an ultrasound imager to generate a reference ultrasound and a first ultrasound image having a soft tissue target, and a processing device coupled to the ultrasound imager to receive the reference ultrasound image and the first ultrasound image, to register the first ultrasound image with the reference ultrasound image, and to determine a displacement of the soft tissue target based on registration of the first ultrasound image with the reference ultrasound image.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for dynamic tracking of soft tissue targets comprising: registering a first ultrasound (US) image having a soft tissue target of a patient with a first reference image of a first modality having the soft tissue target of the patient; determining a first displacement of the soft tissue target based on the registering of the first US image with the first reference image; registering a second US image of the soft tissue target with the first US image of the soft tissue target, wherein the second US image is obtained subsequent to the first US image; determining a second displacement of the soft tissue target based on the registration of the second US image with the first US image; adjusting a position of a radiation source of radiation treatment delivery system using the second displacement; storing the second US image to establish a treatment delivery reference position of the soft tissue target for registration with one or more subsequent US images; and registering the one or more subsequent US images with the treatment delivery reference position to determine a third displacement of the soft tissue target with respect to the treatment delivery reference position of the soft tissue target, wherein the one or more subsequent US images are obtained at a first rate, and wherein determining the third displacement further comprises: tracking a second motion of one or more markers externally disposed on the patient by sensing the one or more markers at a second rate with respect to a fixed coordinate system, wherein the second rate is higher than the first rate; and calculating a predicted position of the soft tissue target as a function of a time using a correlation model based on tracking the second motion of the one or more markers, the correlation model correlates the second motion of the one or more markers to the predicted position of the soft tissue target; and readjusting the position of the radiation source using the third displacement. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first rate is less than approximately 60 Hz and wherein the second rate is greater than approximately 1 Hz. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein predicting the position of the soft tissue target comprises: determining a second position of the one or more markers as a function of time based on tracking the second motion in the fixed coordinate system; registering one or more subsequent US images; and combining the registration results with the position of the one or more markers to compute a location of the soft tissue target in real time. 4. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining whether the predicted position of the soft tissue target in the correlation model deviates from the third displacement in excess of a specified threshold and, if so, comparing previous consecutive US images for consistency; and comparing positions of the one or more markers with the correlation model predicted positions to confirm the positions of the one or more markers. 5. The method of claim 3, wherein the position of one or more external markers is interpolating to a point in time corresponding with an US image or for interpolating between a plurality of US images to create a new image corresponding to the one or more external marker positions.
