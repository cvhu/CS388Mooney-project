The invention provides compositions and methods used to inhibit USP1 deubiquitinase activity and to identify new inhibitors of USP1 deubiquitinase. The inhibitors can be used to treat or prevent cancer, bone marrow failure, and damage to cells or DNA resulting from genotoxic agents such as antineoplasic agents, including chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. The inhibitors include siRNA directed at inhibiting the expression of USP1 or UAF1, a protein which forms a heterodimeric complex with USP1. The inhibitors can be used to enhance cell survival if administered either before or after radiation exposure. Methods are also provided to enhance chemotherapy or radiotherapy of cancer and to enhance DNA repair. Transgenic knockout animals and knockdown cells are provided, whose USP1 expression is impaired.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A composition comprising an isolated Ubiquitin Specific Protease 1 (USP1) polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 or consisting of the polypeptide set forth by amino acids 17-785 of SEQ ID NO: 3, and an isolated Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) polypeptide, wherein said PCNA polypeptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. 2. The composition of claim 1, further comprising a USP1 Accessory Factor 1 (UAF1) polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4. 3. The composition of claim 2, wherein the USP1 polypeptide consists of amino acids 17-785 of SEQ ID NO:3. 4. The composition of claim 2, wherein the USP1 polypeptide and the UAF1 polypeptide form a heterodimeric molecular complex.
