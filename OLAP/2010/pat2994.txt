A tool for manufacturing molecular electronic devices having a coating unit contained in a controlled ambient environment. The coating unit is coupled to a source of active device molecules in solution. The coating unit is configured to apply a selected quantity of the solution to a surface of a substrate and the process tool processes the coated substrate in conditions that cause the active device molecules to attach to active areas of the substrate.
Claims We claim: 1. A method, comprising: forming a layer of storage molecules on a working electrode, wherein the working electrode is built on top of and electrically coupled to an electrode of a transistor in a partially processed semiconductor wafer that includes a plurality of transistors with respective electrodes; attaching some of the storage molecules to the working electrode; removing unattached storage molecules; and applying an electrolyte to the working electrode over the attached storage molecules. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the working electrode is comprised of aluminum, gold, silver, tungsten, titanium nitride or polysilicon. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein the working electrode is oxidized to form an oxide layer. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the attaching is done with a self-assembling process. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein at least some of the attached storage molecules are aligned on the working electrode surface. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the attaching is done in a dehumidified environment. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the storage molecules are monomeric porphyrins, ferrocene-derivatized porphyrins, wing-shaped trimeric porphyrins, directly linked dimeric and trimeric porphyrins, or triple-decker sandwich porphyrins. 8. The method of claim 1, further comprising forming a reference electrode or counter electrode.
