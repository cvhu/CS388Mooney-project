This invention relates to methods and systems for attaching components to strips of material to form assemblies, e.g., a system for fastening pre-sharpened razor blades to individual support strips on a continuous band of material, such as a metal, to form discrete blade assemblies.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system (20) for attaching strips of material (25) to components (51) to form assemblies (71), the system comprising (a) a supply station (15) that dispenses a long band of material (24); and (b) a press station (30) that comprises (i) a die module (40) that cuts individual strips (25) from the band of material, wherein the individual strips (25) remain connected to the band of material (24) by one or more uncut portions (25A); (ii) a receiving module (50) that feeds a series of components (51) into the press station (30) and associates a single component (51) with each individual strip (25) in the band of material; and (iii) a fastening module (60) that connects one component (51) to each individual strip (25) in the band of material (24). 2. The system of claim 1, wherein the press station (30) further comprises a scrap removal module (70) that removes scrap from the individual components (51) without breaking the connection to form individual assemblies (71). 3. The system of claim 1, wherein the press station (30) further comprises a cleaning module (32) that removes contaminants from the individual strips (25) of material cut from the band of material (24). 4. The system of claim 1, wherein the press station (30) further comprises an in-line inspection module (86) that measures one or more features of the assemblies (71) and indicates a variance from a given tolerance for one or more features of the assembly (71). 5. The system of claim 1, further comprising a separation module (90) that removes the assemblies (71) from the band of material (24) by severing the uncut portions (25A). 6. The system of claim 1, further comprising a component supply system (26) that feeds the stream of components (51) into the receiving module (50). 7. The system of claim 1, wherein the material (24) is metal. 8. The system of claim 1, wherein the material (24) is metal and the individual strips (25) are razor blade supports. 9. The system of claim 1, wherein the components (51) are metal. 10. The system of claim 1, wherein the components (51) are razor blades. 11. The system of claim 1, wherein the components (51) are loose and not connected to any strip of material. 12. The system of claim 1, wherein the die module (40) is a progressive die that cuts and shapes the individual strips (25). 13. The system of claim 1, wherein the band of material (24) passes continuously from the supply station (15) to the fastening module (60) of the press station (30). 14. The system of claim 1, wherein the receiving module (50) associates components (51) with individual strips (25) by mechanically interlocking the components (51) with the individual strips (25) or the band of material (24). 15. The system of claim 1, wherein each individual strip (25) has top and bottom surfaces, and the receiving module associates a single component (51) with each individual strip (25) in the band of material (24) by attaching the components (51) to the bottom surfaces of the individual strips (25). 16. The system of claim 1, wherein the fastening module (60) comprises a welding unit that connects one component (51) to each individual strip (25) in the band of material (24) by welding the component (51) to the band of material (24). 17. The system of claim 16, wherein the welding unit comprises a laser that spot welds the components (51) to the individual strips (25). 18. The system of claim 1, wherein the press station (30) operates at a rate of between about 100 strokes per minute and about 500 strokes per minute. 19. The system of claim 1, wherein the press station (30) cuts, connects, and assembles at two parts per stroke.
