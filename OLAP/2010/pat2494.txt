To provide a storage container which can inhibit and prevent generation of dust due to the motions of an advancing and retracting element, whose door element can be formed with a reduced space and thickness and which can prevent contamination of the articles accommodated therein, the storage container includes a container body 1 for storing precision substrates, a door element 10 that opens and closes the front of container body 1 and a locking mechanism 20 for locking and unlocking door element 10 that covers container body 1. Locking mechanism 20 is constructed of a rotary plate 21 that is supported by door element 10, a first advancing and retracting plate 26 that, in accordance with the rotation of rotary plate 21, advances toward the peripheral wall of door element 10 when door element 10 is locked and retracts to the reference position inside door element 10 when door element 10 is unlocked; a second advancing and retracting plate 32 which is supported by the front end part of first advancing and retracting plate 26, and projects out from the peripheral wall of door element 10 and fits into an engaging recess 3 of container body 1 when door element 10 is locked and returns from engaging recess 3 of container body 1 toward the door element when door element 10 is unlocked; a guide rib 37 which makes the second advancing and retracting plate 32 incline in the thickness direction of the door element 10 as the plate is being projected.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A storage container comprising: a container body for accommodating articles; a door element for opening and closing the opening of the container body; and a locking mechanism for locking the door element that covers the opening of the container body, wherein the locking mechanism includes: a rotatable rotary element; a first advancing and retracting element which, in accordance with the rotation of the rotary element, projects toward the door element's periphery from a door element's reference position when the door element is locked and returns to the door element's reference position when the door element is unlocked; a second advancing and retracting element which is rotatably supported by the first advancing and retracting element, and projects out from the door element to be inserted into a recess in the inner periphery of the opening of the container body when the door element is locked and returns from the recess of the container body towards the door element when the door element is unlocked; and a guide element for inclining the second advancing and retracting element in the door element's direction of thickness when it is projecting, wherein a plurality of guides for guiding the first and second advancing and retracting elements to move along guide surfaces of the plurality of guides are formed on opposing surfaces of a casing and a cover of the door element, wherein the first advancing and retracting element includes a neck portion at its front end part and a coupling in attached to said neck portion, and wherein the second advancing and retracting element includes a U-shaped grooved portion formed in its front end part which detachably receives and holds the coupling pin of the first advancing and retracting element, and pin projections projectively formed on both lateral sides thereof so that they can be slidably held between the plurality of guides. 2. The storage container according to claim 1, wherein the door element is formed of the casing to be fitted to the opening of the container body and the cover that covers the casing, the rotary element, first advancing and retracting element and second advancing and retracting element are laid out between the casing and the cover, and the guide element of the locking mechanism is formed at least on one of the opposing surfaces of the casing and the cover. 3. The storage container according to claim 1, wherein the pin projections come into contact with the guide element, the guide element is formed to have a polygonal section, and the contact surface of the guide element that abuts the pin projections is inclined so that the second advancing and retracting element that is projecting is inclined at an angle ranging from 10 to 45 degrees with respect to the first advancing and retracting element. 4. The storage container according to claim 1, wherein the second advancing and retracting element in the locking mechanism is formed as an approximately flat plate, and the front end part of the second advancing and retracting element is formed in a shape that reduces the area of contact with the recess of the container body. 5. The storage container according to claim 2, wherein the pin projections come into contact with the guide element, the guide element is formed to have a polygonal section, and the contact surface of the guide element that abuts the pin projections is inclined so that the second advancing and retracting element that is projecting is inclined at an angle ranging from 10 to 45 degrees with respect to the first advancing and retracting element. 6. The storage container according to claim 2, wherein the second advancing and retracting element in the locking mechanism is formed as an approximately flat plate, and the front end part of the second advancing and retracting element is formed in a shape that reduces the area of contact with the recess of the container body. 7. The storage container according to claim 3, wherein the second advancing and retracting element in the locking mechanism is formed as an approximately flat plate, and the front end part of the second advancing and retracting element is formed in a shape that reduces the area of contact with the recess of the container body. 8. The storage container according to claim 5, wherein the second advancing and retracting element in the locking mechanism is formed as an approximately flat plate, and the front end part of the second advancing and retracting element is formed in a shape that reduces the area of contact with the recess of the container body.
