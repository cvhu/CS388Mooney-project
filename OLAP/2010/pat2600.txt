A printer assembly for a pagewidth printer includes a support frame having a fluid channel member and a clipping arrangement configured so that a printed circuit board can be clipped to the support frame. A printhead arrangement has printhead tiles arranged in the fluid channel member. The support frame is configured so that a positional relationship between individual tile members is substantially retained during environmental changes.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printer assembly for a pagewidth printer, said assembly comprising a support frame having a fluid channel member and a clipping arrangement configured so that a printed circuit board can be clipped to the support frame; and a printhead arrangement having printhead tiles arranged in the fluid channel member, the support frame being configured so that a positional relationship between individual tile members is substantially retained during environmental changes. 2. A printer assembly as claimed in claim 1, in which the fluid channel member has a body portion having open channels therein, and a lid portion which is shaped with elongate ridge portions to be operatively received in the open channels, said body and lid portions adhered together to form channel-shaped ducts to deliver printing fluids to at least one printhead tile supported by said member. 3. The printer assembly of claim 2, wherein each tile has an integrated circuit with a plurality of micro-electromechanical nozzle arrangements for ejecting the printing fluid onto a print medium, and a fluid distribution stack having a plurality of laminated layers, said stack arranged in fluid communication with the ducts.
