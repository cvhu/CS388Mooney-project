The present invention is directed to polypeptides that have enhanced alanine 2,3-aminomutase (AAM) activity and/or thermostability relative to the wild-type enzymes that have incidental AAM activity as a result of cross reactivity with alanine. In addition, the present invention is directed to a polynucleotides that encodes for the AAM polypeptides of the present invention, to nucleic acid sequences comprising the polynucleotides, to expression vectors comprising the polynucleotides operatively linked to a promoter, to host cells transformed to express the AAM polypeptides, and to a method for producing the AAM polypeptides of the present invention.
