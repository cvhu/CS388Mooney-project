An apparatus and related methods for ultrasonically scanning a tissue sample are described, the apparatus comprising an ultrasound transducer and a taut fabric sheet compressing the tissue sample, the ultrasound transducer contacting the taut fabric sheet and ultrasonically scanning the tissue sample therethrough. Preferably, the taut fabric sheet is substantially porous with respect to an acoustic couplant. In another embodiment, an ultrasound transducer and a vented membrane are provided, the vented membrane having a first surface contacting the tissue surface and a second surface opposite the first surface, the ultrasound transducer contacting the second surface and being translated across the second surface for ultrasonically scanning the tissue volume. An acoustic couplant is applied to one of the tissue surface, the first surface, and the second surface, the vented membrane being provided with a void pattern such that it is substantially porous with respect to the acoustic coupling agent.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A process [FIGS. 1 & 2] of ultrasonically scanning an upwardly facing breast of a supine patient while pressing the breast from above with a couplant-impregnated porous sheet that is secured to and moving with an ultrasound scanning assembly suspended on an articulated arm, which articulated arm selectively moves the scanning assembly up to place the porous sheet out of contact with the breast and down to place the porous sheet in a scanning position in pressing contact with the breast, comprising: providing a scanning assembly [108] having secured thereto a substantially taut sheet that is porous with respect to an acoustic couplant liquid [118, 302, 1002, 1102, 1302], wherein said scanning assembly, with the porous sheet secured thereto, is suspended on an articulated arm [106] above the breast, with the porous sheet out of contact with the breast; selectively manipulating the articulated arm to thereby move the scanning assembly, with the porous sheet maintained secured thereto, downward into a scanning position in which an exposed surface of said porous sheet comes into and maintains a pressing contact with the breast; impregnating said porous sheet with acoustic couplant liquid while away from the breast and/or in contact with the breast; when the scanning assembly is in said scanning position and the porous sheet is impregnated with said acoustic couplant, scanning the breast through said acoustic couplant impregnated sheet with a mechanically controlled ultrasound transducer [202, 404, 606] contained in the scanning assembly; said ultrasound transducer moving with respect to said porous sheet along a selected scanning path [502, 504, FIG. 6B] while remaining in contact with a surface of said sheet opposite said exposed surface that maintains a pressing contact with the breast during said scanning; said ultrasound transducer sending ultrasound energy into the breast and receiving ultrasound energy from the breast though said acoustic couplant impregnated porous sheet during said scanning; and selectively manipulating said articulated arm after said scanning to thereby move said scanning assembly upward and out of contact between the breast and the acoustic couplant impregnated porous sheet. 2. A process as in claim 1 further including deriving ultrasound data from ultrasound energy received by said ultrasound transducer and breast images from said ultrasound data. 3. An apparatus [FIGS. 1 & 2] for ultrasonically scanning an upwardly facing breast of a supine patient while pressing the breast from above with a substantially taut, porous sheet that is secured to an ultrasound scanning assembly suspended on an articulated arm, which articulating arm selectively moves the scanning assembly up to place the porous sheet out of contact with the breast and down to place the porous sheet in a scanning position in pressing contact with the breast, comprising: a scanning assembly [108] and an articulated arm [106] suspending the scanning assembly for motion up and down relative to an upwardly facing breast of a supine patient; a substantially taut sheet [118, 302, 1002, 1102, 1302] secured to the scanning assembly; said sheet being porous with respect to an acoustic couplant; said articulated arm being configured to selectively move the scanning assembly up to thereby place the porous sheet out of contact with the breast and down to place and maintain the porous sheet in a scanning position in pressing contact with the breast; said porous sheet having an exposed lower surface contacting the breast when the sheet is said scanning position, and an opposite, upper surface; an ultrasound transducer [202, 404, 606] in the scanning assembly, said ultrasound transducer being mechanically controlled to maintain contact with and scan relative to said upper surface of the porous sheet along a selected path [502, 504, FIG. 6B] when said porous sheet is in said scanning position; said ultrasound transducer transmitting ultrasound energy to the breast and receiving ultrasound energy from the breast through said porous sheet while said ultrasound transducer is scanning along said path; and a support [104] coupled with the articulated arm to support the arm for motion relative to the patient. 4. An apparatus as in claim 3 in which said porous sheet that is secured to and moves with said scanning assembly is a substantially taut fabric sheet [118, 302].
