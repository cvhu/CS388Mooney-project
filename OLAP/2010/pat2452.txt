A robotic bending apparatus for bending archwires and other types of elongate, bendable medical devices into a desired configuration includes a first gripping tool and a moveable gripping tool. The first gripping tool can be either fixed with respect to a base or table for the robot or positioned at the end of robot am. The moveable gripping tool is mounted to the end of a moveable robot arm having a proximal portion also mounted to the base. The robot preferably comprises a six axis bending robot, in which the distal end of the moveable arm can move relative to the fixed gripping tool about three translational axes and three rotational axes. The robot bending system is able to form archwires with any required second and third order bends quickly and with high precision.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of forming a complex bend in a patient specific archwire, comprising: Acquiring three-dimensional digital information of the dentition of the patient; Planning an orthodontic treatment for the patient by manipulating the acquired three-dimensional digital information of the dentition of the patient using an orthodontic treatment planning software program; and Forming at least one complex bend positioned on the patient specific archwire based on the planned orthodontic treatment for the patient by gripping said archwire with a first gripper and a second gripper; wherein said second gripper is mounted on a movable arm of a wire bending robot under the control of a computer; Wherein said complex bend comprises a bend and a twist. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein planning an orthodontic treatment for the patient further comprises selectively placing virtual brackets on the three-dimensional digital information of the dentition of the patient. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional digital information of the dentition of the patient comprises CT scan data.
