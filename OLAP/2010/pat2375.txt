A process condition measuring device and a handling system may be highly integrated with a production environment where the dimensions of the process condition measuring device are close to those of a production substrate and the handling system is similar to a substrate carrier used for production substrates. Process conditions may be measured with little disturbance to the production environment. Data may be transferred from a process condition-measuring device to a user with little or no human intervention.
Claims It is claimed: 1. In a battery powered portable measuring instrument including a substrate with a plurality of sensors of a parameter distributed across a surface thereof, a method of compressing the amount of data obtained from the sensors of the parameter by processing on the measuring instrument, comprising: computing different sets of differences between values of the parameter from the same set of data by: calculating a first set of differences between values of the parameter read at different times by individual sensors, calculating a second set of differences between values of the parameter read at a given time by the plurality of sensors, and selecting one of the first set or second set of differences that represents the values of the parameter read by the sensors with the lesser amount of data. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the values of the parameter are digital values. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein the digital values contain a number of bits that represent the values measured by the sensors with a full resolution. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the differences between the values of the parameter comprise a fewer number of bits than the values with the full resolution.
