Systems are described herein for remotely aligning and placing disruptive devices at or near suspicious targets such as suspected improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In particular, tools connected to remotely controllable robots include disruptor guns for firing disruptive materials at the targets and disruptive devices filled with explosive materials, e.g., water, for controllably detonating or disrupting the detonation of the targets when placed in close proximity thereto.
Claims We claim: 1. A system for placing a gun barrel within firing distance of a target, the system comprising: a remote controlled vehicle including a remotely controllable arm; a first component attached to the vehicle, the first component including parallel vertical tracks; and a second component including first and second sets of rollers for rolling the second component along the parallel vertical tracks, the second component further including a gun barrel positioned approximately perpendicular to the parallel vertical tracks, wherein the first component further includes a first and a second pair of pulleys and the system further includes at least one cable connected to at least one pulley in each of the first and second pairs of pulleys and connected to the second component and the remotely controllable arm. 2. The system according to claim 1, where in the first component further includes means for attaching the first component to the vehicle. 3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the means for attaching the first component to the vehicle includes at least one shock absorber. 4. The system according to claim 1, wherein the second component further comprises securing means for attaching the second component directly to the vehicle. 5. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a third component for holding the first and second components, the third component being removably attached to the vehicle.
