A printed circuit board (PCB) assembly has a number of modular printhead controller printed circuit board (PCB), Electrical connector assemblies operatively connect respective PCBs to each other. Each connector assembly has a connecting member with a series of parallel spaced conducting strips. Each member is shaped and configured for fitment into a cavity defined by the raised and recessed portions of two abutting supports to connect the connecting strips of two PCBs via said conducting strips. Each PCB is mounted to a respective modular support that defines a raised portion and a recessed portion at an end thereof. The PCBs each have electrical connecting strips which overlie the respective recessed portions.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printed circuit board (PCB) assembly that comprises a number of modular PCBs; electrical connector assemblies for operatively connecting respective PCBs to each other, each connector assembly having a connecting member with a series of parallel spaced conducting strips, said member shaped and configured for fitment into a cavity defined by the raised and recessed portions of two abutting supports to connect the connecting strips of two PCBs via said conducting strips; and modular supports, each PCB mounted to a respective modular support defining a raised portion and a recessed portion at an end thereof, each PCB having electrical connecting strips which overlie the respective recessed portions. 2. The PCB assembly of claim 1, wherein the conducting strips of each connecting member are provided in a 2:1 relationship with the connecting strips of the PCB. 3. The PCB assembly of claim 1, wherein the connecting strips are each about 0.4 mm wide with a 0.4 mm gap between adjacent strips. 4. The PCB assembly of claim 1, wherein the conducting strips are gold plated.
