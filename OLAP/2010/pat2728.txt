A method of characterizing the biological activity of a candidate compound may include exposing cells to the candidate compound, and then exposing the cells to a repetitive application of electric fields so as to set the transmembrane potential to a level corresponding to a pre-selected voltage dependent state of a target ion channel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for modulating the voltage dependent state of an ion channel by modulating the transmembrane potential of said cell comprising: repetitively applying biphasic electric field pulses produced with extracellular electrodes to said cell, wherein said pulses have a maximum amplitude of less than approximately 90 V/cm, wherein said pulses are applied at a rate of at least about 1 per second, and wherein the total duration of each pulse is at least about 1 millisecond. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said biphasic electric field is a square wave kernel of about 5 msec per phase. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said pulses have a maximum amplitude of about 25 V/cm. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said pulses are applied at a rate of about 20 per second. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein said total duration is of about three seconds.
