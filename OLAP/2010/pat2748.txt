A method of forming a multiwell filtration plate comprising of first gluing a filter to a major surface of a multiwell plate so as to close off one entrance to the wells of the plate. The filter is then heat sealed so as to collapse the pores of the filter in the area between the wells so as to prevent lateral migration of fluid from one well to another.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of forming a multiwell filtration plate comprising the steps of: a) providing a multiwell plate containing a series of wells formed through the thickness of the plate, the plate having a top and a bottom surface and the wells having an open top corresponding with the top surface of the plate and an open bottom corresponding with the bottom surface of the plate; b) applying glue to the bottom surface of the plate surrounding each well; c) providing a filter sheet of a size equal to or greater than that of the bottom surface of the plate and applying the filter sheet to the bottom of the plate; d) allowing the glue to penetrate the filter material; e) allowing the glue to cure; and f) then heat bonding the filter material overlaying the bottom surface of the plate surrounding the wells via a laser. 2. A method of forming a multiwell filtration plate comprising the steps of: a) providing a multiwell plate containing a series of wells formed through the thickness of the plate, the plate having a top and a bottom surface and the wells having an open top corresponding with the top surface of the plate and an open bottom corresponding with the bottom surface of the plate; b) applying glue to the bottom surface of the plate surrounding each well; c) providing a filter sheet of a size equal to or greater than that of the bottom surface of the plate and applying the filter sheet to the bottom of the plate; d) allowing the glue to penetrate the filter material; e) allowing the glue to cure; and f) then heat bonding via a laser the filter material overlaying the bottom surface of the plate surrounding the wells so as to render the heat treated areas non-porous. 3.
