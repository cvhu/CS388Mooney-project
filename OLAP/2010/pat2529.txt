In one aspect, a supported walking system is disclosed, comprising a robotic walking figure and a wheeled support that at least partially supports the robotic walking figure. The supported walking system may be driven and controlled by a human operator. Computer algorithms automatically control the robot's walking functions so that it may step forwards, backwards, and sideways in synchronicity with the movements of the cart while driving and turning at varying speeds.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A skeletal support system for an animatronic figure, comprising: a plurality of rings, each of the rings being shaped according to a cross section of the animatronic figure; and a plurality of flexible connectors, the plurality of rings connected to each other with at least one flexible connector between adjacent ones of the rings, wherein the at least one of the flexible connectors is sandwiched between the adjacent ones of the rings and is compressible and expandable such that the adjacent ones of the rings can compress and expand upon each other, whereby the skeletal support system is free to move and bend while providing a structure for skin or other covering. 2. The skeletal support system of claim 1, wherein a skin is stretched over the skeletal support system. 3. The skeletal support system of claim 2, wherein the skin comprises foam latex. 4. The skeletal support system of claim 1, wherein the rings are made of aluminum, fiberglass, or plastic. 5. The skeletal support system of claim 1, wherein the rings comprise a honeycomb structure. 6. The skeletal support system of claim 1, wherein the flexible connectors comprise rubber tubing and wherein the connectors are positioned such that a sidewall of the tubing abuts both of the adjacent ones of the rings. 7. The skeletal support system of claim 1, wherein at least some of the rings are not closed into a complete loop.
