In order to prevent stacks of containers from shifting under the influence of vibration produced by an automated product handling system and assuming positions wherein jamming/mishandling is apt to occur, a container saddle ad stopper arrangement is provided on one or more of the platforms on which the container stacks are received and arranged to engage in recesses formed in the underside of the containers in a manner which ensures that the lowermost trays assume the required orientation and position on the platform.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated product handling system comprising: a stack of trays wherein at least a bottom tray of said stack is formed with a predetermined shaped recess in a lower surface thereof; conveyor means for moving said stack of trays along a predetermined path; a platform at an end of said predetermined path on which said stack of trays can be received; tray saddle means on said platform for locating said stack of trays in a predetermined position and orientation on said platform, said tray saddle means being arranged to be received in said predetermined shaped recess; and stopper means mounted on said platform for engaging said stack of trays and for limiting relative movement between said stack of trays and said platform and for positioning said stack of trays so that said tray saddle means is substantially aligned with said recess. 2. An automated product handling system as set forth in claim 1, wherein said stack of trays comprises a plurality of substantially identical trays. 3. An automated product handling system as set forth in claim 1, wherein said tray saddle means comprises a cross-shaped member which is secured to an upper surface of said platform. 4. An automated product handling system as set forth in claim 3, wherein said stopper means comprises a plurality of backstops which are fastened to an edge portion of said platform in a predetermined spaced relationship with said cross-shaped member. 5. A method of handling a stack of trays comprising the steps of: transporting a stack of trays to a first end of a first conveyor line; loading said stack of trays onto a first tray elevator by moving the stack of trays from said conveyor line and over a vertically movable base member; stopping horizontal motion of said stack of trays using stoppers which are connected to said vertically movable base member in a manner which locates said stack of trays in a predetermined relationship with respect to said vertically movable base member; raising said vertically movable base member; engaging a tray saddle which is secured to said vertically movable base member, with a lower surface of a lower tray of said stack of trays in a manner which locates and orients said stack of trays in a predetermined position and a predetermined direction with respect to said vertically movable base member, respectively; and moving said stack of trays from said predetermined position to a position wherein said stack of trays are subjected to a predetermined operation. 6. An apparatus for handling a stack of trays comprising: means for transporting a stack of trays to a first end of a first conveyor line; means for loading said stack of trays onto a first tray elevator by moving the stack of trays off said conveyor line and over a vertically movable base member; stoppers on said vertically movable base member for stopping horizontal motion of said stack of trays in a manner which locates said stack of trays in a predetermined relationship with respect to said vertically movable base member; a tray saddle which is secured to said vertically movable base, for engaging a lower surface of a lower tray of said stack of trays in a manner which locates and orients said stack of trays in a predetermined position and a predetermined direction with respect to said vertically movable base, respectively; and means for moving said stack of trays from said predetermined position to a position wherein said stack of trays can be subject to a predetermined operation. 7. An automated handling system comprising: stack of containers arranged so that each can be filled with articles of manufacture; filling and stacking means for filling the containers with the articles of manufacture and stacking the containers into said stack; a plurality of conveyor lines arranged in a predetermined relationship with said filling and stacking means; shuttle means for moving said stack of containers between a selected one of said conveyor lines and said filling and stacking means, said shuttle means including an elevator platform; a vertically movable base member which forms part of said elevator platform; a container saddle secured to the upper surface of said vertically movable base member; and stopper means secured to the said vertically movable base member and arranged with respect to said container saddle means so as to abut said stack of containers and locate said stack so that upon vertical displacement of said vertically movable base member, said container saddle engages with the lower surface of a lowest container of said stack and causes said stack to be oriented and positioned in a predetermined manner.
