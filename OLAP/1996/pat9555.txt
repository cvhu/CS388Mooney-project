A data processing device includes a data bus and a program bus, a data memory connected to the data bus and having data memory locations, and an electronic computation unit connected to the data bus and an accumulator connected to the electronic computation unit and to the data bus. A logic circuit is connected to the program bus for receiving instructions and connected to the data bus for executing logic operations in accordance with at least some of the instructions. The logic operations affect bits in at least one of the data memory locations independently of the electronic computation unit without affecting the accumulator. A control circuit sends instructions to the logic circuit on the program bus and to the electronic computation unit. Other devices, systems and methods are also disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A modem, comprising: A combined analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converter circuit for connection to a telephone line; and a processing circuit, connected to said converter circuit and for connection to a telephone, including a single-chip data processing device operable for both scrambling and modulation, said device including: data bus, a program bus, a data memory connected to said data bus and having data memory locations, an electronic computation unit connected to said data bus and to said program bus, an accumulator connected to said electronic computation unit and to said data bus, logic circuit connected to said program bus for receiving instructions and connected to said data bus for executing logic operations in accordance with at least some of the instructions, the logic operations affecting bits in at least some of said data memory locations independently of said electronic computation unit without affecting said accumulator, and a control circuit for sending instructions to said logic circuit on said program bus and to said electronic computation unit, and wherein said logic circuit executes operations in a scrambling process simultaneously with said electronic computation unit executing operations in a modulation process. 2. The modem of claim 1 wherein said logic circuit includes circuitry for executing an exclusive-OR operation on bits representative of a speech signal.
