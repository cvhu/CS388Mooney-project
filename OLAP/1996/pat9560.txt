An acoustic ranging and detection system comprises an acoustic transmitter for producing an acoustic ranging signal and first and second acoustic receivers positioned on either side of the acoustic transmitter. A support mounts the acoustic transmitter and both acoustic receivers for concurrent rotation about a central axis passing through the acoustic transmitter. A first motor is connected to the first acoustic receiver and is adapted to impart independent rotative movement thereto. A second motor is connected to the second acoustic receiver and is adapted to impart independent rotative movement thereto. A control system is responsive to echo signals from a target that are received by the first and second acoustic receivers to rotate the support to point the transmitter at the target and further operates the first and second motors to cause the respective acoustic receivers to be repositioned so as to manifest receiving beam patterns which exhibit central axes that intersect in the region of the target. A translation motor is also connected to the support so as to enable a relative translation between the target and the transmitter and receivers so as to enable a differentiation between targets appearing at approximately the same initial distance from the acoustic receivers.
Claims What is claimed: 1. An acoustic ranging and detection system, comprising: acoustic transmitter means for transmitting an acoustic ranging signal along a transmitter azimuth; first acoustic receiving means positioned to a first side of said acoustic transmitter means and having a receiving beam pattern with a first central azimuthal axis; second acoustic receiving means positioned to a second side of said acoustic transmitter means and having a receiving beam pattern with a second central azimuthal axis; rotative means for mounting said acoustic transmitter means, first acoustic receiving means and second acoustic receiving means for concurrent rotation about an axis passing through said acoustic transmitter means; first means for imparting independent rotative movement to said first acoustic receiving means; second means for imparting independent rotative movement to said second acoustic receiving means; and a control system responsive to target reflection signals received at said first and second acoustic receiving means, for moving said rotative means so as to point said transmitter azimuth at said target and to operate said first and second means to counter-rotate said first acoustic receiving means and second acoustic receiving means so as to point both said first azimuthal axis and second azimuthal axis towards said target and to cause said first azimuthal axis and second azimuthal axis to intersect in a region of said target, to thereby reduce an echo producing region about said target. 2. The acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 1, wherein said rotative means comprises: a platform supporting said acoustic transmitter means, first acoustic receiving means and second acoustic receiving means; and motor means connected to said platform for rotating said platform. 3. The acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 2, wherein said first means comprises a motor coupled to said first acoustic receiving means and said second means comprises a motor coupled to said second acoustic receiving means, both motors mounted for rotation with said platform. 4. The acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 1, further comprising: translative means connected to said rotative means for causing said rotative means to translate along a first axis which intersects an axis of a direction of propagation of said acoustic ranging signal, said translative means responsive to a signal from said control system to cause said rotative means to move along first said axis. 5. The acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 4 wherein said control system operates said translative means upon determining that a first echo signal from a target object does not meet a signal amplitude criteria. 6. An acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 1 wherein said control system is responsive to a time difference in sensed reflection signals from said first acoustic receiving means and second acoustic receiving means, to cause said rotative means to move said transmitter means so as to orient an axis, along which said acoustic ranging signal is generated, to be coincident with said target and, simultaneously, to cause said first means and second means to rotate said first acoustic receiving means and second acoustic receiving means, respectively to position central axes of receiving beam patterns thereof to intersect said central axis at said target. 7. An acoustic ranging and detection system, comprising: an acoustic transmitter for transmitting an acoustic ranging signal; a first acoustic receiver positioned to a first side of said acoustic transmitter and having a receiving beam pattern with a first central azimuthal axis; a second acoustic receiver positioned to a second side of said acoustic transmitter means and having a receiving beam pattern with a second central azimuthal axis; platform means for mounting said acoustic transmitter, first acoustic receiver and second acoustic receiver for concurrent rotation about an axis passing through said acoustic transmitter; platform movement means for imparting rotational motion to said platform means about said axis; first means for imparting independent rotative movement to said first acoustic receiver; second means for imparting independent rotative movement to said second acoustic receiver; and a control system responsive to reflection signals from a target received at said first and second acoustic receivers for operating said platform movement means to rotate said platform in a direction to point said acoustic transmitter at said target and to operate said first and second means to counter-rotate said first acoustic receiver and second acoustic receiver so as to bring said first central azimuthal axis and second central azimuthal axis into a position of intersection in a region of said target and to thereby reduce an echo producing region about said target. 8. The acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 7, further comprising: translative means connected to said platform means for causing said platform means to translate along a first axis which intersects an axis of a direction of propagation of said acoustic ranging signal, said translative means responsive to a signal from said control system to cause said platform means to move along said first axis. 9. An acoustic ranging and detection system as recited in claim 7 wherein said control system is responsive to a time difference in sensed reflection signals from said first acoustic receiver and second acoustic receiver to cause said platform movement means to move said platform means and transmitter means in incremental steps to orient an azimuth axis along which said acoustic ranging signal is generated to be coincident with said target and, simultaneously, to cause said first means and second means to rotate, in incremental steps, said first acoustic receiver and second acoustic receiver to move central axes of receiving beam patterns thereof so that they intersect said azimuth axis at said target, said incremental steps occurring substantially simultaneously, and one step per acoustic ranging signal.
