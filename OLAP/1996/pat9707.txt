An electrical type strain gauge for measuring both micro and macro deformations. The gauge may be constructed from thin films of homogeneously conductive polymers, including soluble polyaniline-based conducting polymers and ion-implanted organic polymers. The gauges are characterized by unexpected piezoresistivity from materials having high bulk resistivity, thermal stability, good flexibility, photoimageability and without adding carbon or metal particulate material to the polymer.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A piezoresistive film gauge, for transducing electrical signals from large flexural deformations, said film gauge comprising a. thermally stable, homogeneously conductive organic film, said film being selected from the group consisting of i. solvent-soluble substituted polyanilines, and ii. organic films which have been made semiconductive by ion implantation; and b. having electrodes attached to the film, for resistance measurement, without lead resistance being an appreciable part of conductivity; whereby flexural deformations can be transduced into electrical signals in homogeneously conductive polymers, thus negating heterogeneous conductive islands intersticed in a thermally unstable insulating polymer matrix. 2. The gauge of claim 1 having photolithographic features patterned into the film. 3. Film gauge of claim 1 arranged as a flexible array of a plurality of force transducers. 4. The film gauge of claim 1 wherein polyaniline is blended in solution with a second polymer. 5. The film gauge of claim 4 wherein the second polymer is polyimide.
