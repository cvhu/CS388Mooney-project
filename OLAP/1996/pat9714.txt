A gripper mechanism having at least one pair of opposing and co-acting gripper fingers that can be actuated to move from a non-gripping to a gripping position and vice versa upon application of a control signal to the gripper and the subsequent motion of the gripper actuator being applied to move the gripper fingers. The gripper provides an assembly to adjust the spacing between each of the pairs of opposing and co-acting gripper fingers, thus providing an adjustability feature to the gripper permitting thereby the ability of the gripper to grip parts of different sizes and of irregular geometries. One or more grippers as previously described may be incorporated with a material-handling apparatus having controls, power sources, platforms and other features appropriate to handle, orient, operate on, move and otherwise process parts in any fashion, where the gripper provides the apparatus with the adjustability to grip, hold, handle, orient and move parts of different sizes.
Claims I claim: 1. A gripper mechanism which is adjustable for gripping parts of different sizes, wherein said gripper comprises: at least one pair of opposing and co-acting gripper fingers, means for actuating said pair of gripper fingers from a non-gripping to a gripping position and from said gripping position to said non-gripping position, and means for adjusting of a grip spacing dimension between said opposing and co-acting gripper fingers wherein said means for adjusting of a grip spacing dimension comprises at least one pair of pivot nuts wherein one of said pair is a right hand threaded pivot nut and another of said pair is a left-hand threaded pivot nut, each said pivot nut pivotally attached to one finger of said pair of gripper fingers, a gripper finger lead screw interconnecting said pivot nuts spaced apart such that adjustment of said lead screw affects said grip spacing dimension. 2. The gripper mechanism according to claim 1, said means for adjusting of a grip spacing dimension further includes at least one gripper finger link assembly for adjusting the location of end point positions and the motion of said fingers relative to said means for actuating, said assembly comprising: a pair of gripper finger links having one end pivotally attached to one of said fingers and another end in slideable attachment to said means for actuating and said another end adjustably positionable relative to said means for actuating in a manner such that adjustments to said gripper finger link assembly affect said end point positions of the stroke of said finger and said motion of said finger relative to the motion of said means for actuating. 3. The gripper mechanism according to claim 1 wherein said gripper mechanism further comprises means for controlling a gripper finger pivot angle said pivot angle being measured from said gripping position to said non-gripping position. 4. The gripper mechanism according to claim 3 wherein said means for adjusting a grip spacing dimension comprises at least one pair of pivot nuts to which said gripper fingers are pivotally attached, said pivot nuts configured to be slideable within a gripper finger links track component; at least one gripper finger lead screw, said at least one gripper finger lead screw having a right-hand threaded portion and a left-hand threaded portion adjacent said right-hand threaded portion and a control end, each said right-hand threaded portion and left-hand threaded portion configured to cooperate with said pivot nuts and provide for interconnection and definition of a grip space dimension between said gripper fingers. 5. The gripper mechanism according to claim 4 wherein said means for controlling a gripper finger pivot angle comprises: each said fingers having a motion relative to said motion of said means for actuating, said finger having end point positions and a stroke, a pair of gripper finger links having one end pivotally attached to one of said fingers and another end in slideable attachment to said means for actuating and said another end adjustably positionable relative to said means for actuating in a manner such that adjustments to said gripper mechanism affect said end point positions of said stroke of said finger and said motion of said finger relative to the motion of said means for actuating. 6. The gripper mechanism according to claim 3 wherein said means for controlling a gripper finger pivot angle comprises: each said finger having a motion relative to said motion of said means for actuating, said finger having end point positions and a stroke, a pair of gripper finger links having one end pivotally attached to one of said fingers and another end in slideable attachment to said means for actuating and said another end adjustably positionable relative to said means for actuating in a manner such that adjustments to said gripper mechanism affect said end point positions of said stroke of said finger and the motion of said finger relative to the motion of said means for actuating. 7. A gripper mechanism which is adjustable for gripping parts of different sizes, wherein said gripper comprises: at least one pair of opposing and co-acting gripper fingers, means for actuating said pair of gripper fingers from a non-gripping to a gripping position and from said gripping position to said non-gripping position, and means for adjusting of a grip spacing dimension between at least one pair of said opposing co-acting gripper fingers, said means for adjusting of a grip spacing dimension includes at least one gripper finger link assembly for adjusting the location of end point positions and the motion of said fingers relative to said means for actuating, said assembly comprising: a pair of gripper finger links having one end pivotally attached to one of said fingers and another end in slideable attachment to said means for actuating and said another end adjustably positionable relative to said means for actuating in a manner such that adjustments to said gripper finger link assembly affect said end point positions of the stroke of said finger and said motion of said finger relative to the motion of said means for actuating. 8. The gripper mechanism according to claim 7 wherein said means for adjusting of a grip spacing dimension further comprises at least one pair of pivot nuts wherein one of said pair is a right-hand threaded pivot nut and another of said pair is a left-hand threaded pivot nut, each said pivot nut pivotally attached to one finger of said pair of gripper fingers, a gripper finger lead screw interconnecting said pivot nuts spaced apart such that adjustment of said lead screw affects said grip spacing dimension.
