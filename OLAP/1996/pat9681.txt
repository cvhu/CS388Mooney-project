An improved apparatus and method for cleaning and stripping residue, contaminants, and debris from all of the interior surfaces in a storage tank and the like. The present invention may be conveniently inserted into a tank through its manway and, after quick assembly thereof, hydraulically positioned vertically and then maneuvered and articulated to clean and strip interior storage tank surfaces. A means is provided which inherently coordinates and synchronizes hydraulically driven rotation of the vertical pole on the tank floor with the hydraulically driven rotation of a spray bar disposed at the remote end of a boom assembly. Close proximity of the spray to the surfaces is controlled by hydraulically operated cylinders contained on a rotor assembly.
