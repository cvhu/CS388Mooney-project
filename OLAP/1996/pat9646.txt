A method and apparatus for calibrating a robot for differences between the actual and predicted positions of a robot chamber with respect to the robot, and for differences between the actual and predicted positions of a processing chamber with respect to the robot. A substrate support on the robot is first moved angularly across a fixed sensor in the robot chamber, to detect the actual position of the sensor in terms of angle, and second is moved radially out across the fixed sensor to detect actual position in terms of radius with respect to a center of rotation. The difference, if any, between the actual and predicted positions of the sensor is used to calibrate a home position of the robot. A similar technique is used to calibrate the robot for any discrepancy between the actual and predicted positions of a processing chamber adjoining the robot chamber.
