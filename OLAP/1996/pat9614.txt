Probing system performance is improved by dynamically positioning a test probe at a test site during the gantry settling interval using a high performance secondary positioner to compensate for the inherent moving mass oscillational displacements. A primary positioner positions the gantry and its associated test probe to within a predetermined axis distance of the test site and a secondary positioner dynamically maintains the test probe at a target position corresponding to the test site during the settling interval by imparting compensating displacements to the test probe to counteract the displacement errors incurred as the primary positioner attempts to settle the gantry at the test site. Similarly, automatic machine tool performance is improved by dynamically positioning a work tool at a work site during the gantry settling interval using a high performance secondary positioner to compensate for the inherent moving mass oscillational displacements. A primary positioner positions the gantry and its associated work tool to within a predetermined axis distance of the work site and a secondary positioner dynamically maintains the work tool at a target position corresponding to the work site during the settling interval by imparting compensating displacements to the work tool to counteract the displacement errors incurred as the primary positioner attempts to settle the gantry at the work site.
