An ambulatory (in the home) patient health monitoring system is disclosed wherein the patient is monitored by a health care worker at a central station, while the patient is at a remote location. The patient may be a person having a specific medical condition monitored or may be an elderly person desiring general medical surveillance in the home environment. Cameras are provided at the patient's remote location and at the central station such that the patient and the health care worker are in interactive visual and audio communication. A communications network such as an interactive cable television is used for this purpose. Various medical condition sensing and monitoring equipment are placed in the patient's home, depending on the particular medical needs of the patient. The patient's medical condition is measured or sensed in the home and the resulting data is transmitted to the central station for analysis and display. The health care worker then is placed into interactive visual communication with the patient concerning the patient's general well being, as well as the patient's medical condition. Thus, the health care worker can make "home visits" electronically, twenty-four hours a day.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An interactive system for monitoring the condition of a patient by a health practitioner, said patient located at a remote location from a central monitoring station and capable of activity of the head and face, said health practitioner located at the central station, the system comprising, in combination: a) first audio-visual means for generating a first audio-visual signal of said patient at the remote location; b) means for generating medical signals representative of a measured medical condition, said means for generating including the visual and the audio transmission signal for specified anatomical, morphological and expression features of the head and face of the patient and changes in said anatomical, morphological and expression features of the head and face of said patient in response to patient performance of commands affecting the head and face within the audio and visual field of the means for generating the first audio visual signal; c) a central monitoring station; d) means for measuring the medical condition of said patient at the central station, said means for measuring including means for audibly and visually observing and measuring specified anatomical, morphological and expression features of the head and face of said patient; e) means for transmission of said first audio-visual signal to said central station; g) display means at said central station for display of said first audio-visual signal including said medical signals; h) means at the central station for recordal and analysis of the anatomical, morphological and expression feature measurements of said patient; i) second audio-visual means for generating a second audio-visual signal of said health practitioner originating from said central station; j) means for transmission of said second audio-visual signal to said remote location; and k) means for display of said second audio-visual signal at said remote location for observation by the patient simultaneously with transmission of the first audio-visual transmission; whereby said patient and said health practitioner are capable of substantially simultaneous interactive communication concerning said medical condition. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein the means for measuring a medical condition at the central station comprise means for comparative observations of the patient with diagnostic standards, said means for comparative observations selected from a group consisting of (a) color of skin, lips and tongue of the patient, (b) facial asymmetry, (c) eyelid position, (d) eye movement, (e) pupil reaction, (f) form of speech, (g) tongue movement, (h) size and condition of neck veins and (i) emotional condition. 3. The system of claim 1 further including additional means for measuring specified anatomical and morphological conditions of a patient's body, hands or arms. 4. The system of claim 3 wherein the additional means for measuring comprise comparative observations of the patient with diagnostic standards, said observations selected from a group consisting of (a) hand preference and strength, (b) coordination of hands, (c) muscle tone, (d) touch and sensation, (e) coordination and movement of fingers, (f) coordination of arms, (g) body balance and (h) breathing pattern. 5. An interactive system for monitoring the condition of a patient by a health practitioner, said patient located at a remote location from a central monitoring station and capable of activity of the body, hands, arms or fingers, said health practitioner located at the central station, the system comprising, in combination: a) first audio-visual means for generating a first audio-visual signal of said patient at the remote location; b) means for generating medical signals representative of one or more medical conditions at the remote location, said means for generating medical signals including audio and visual means for generating; c) a central monitoring station; d) means for measuring a medical condition at the central station, said means for measuring including means for audibly and visually observing and measuring specified anatomical and morphological condition of the patient's body, hands, arms or fingers in response to patient performance of commands affecting the body, hands, arms or fingers within the audio and visual field of the means for generating a first audio-visual signal, said observations selected from the group consisting of (a) hand preference, (b) hand strength, (c) hand coordination, (d) muscle tone, (e) touch and sensation, (f) coordination and movement of fingers, (g) coordination of arms, (h) body balance, (i) body position, and (j) breathing pattern; e) means for transmission of said first audio-visual signal to said central station; f) means for recordal and analysis of the anatomical and morphological condition measurements of said patient; g) second audio-visual means for generating a second audio-visual signal of said health practitioner originating from said central station; h) means for transmission of said second audio-visual signal to said remote location; and i) means for display of said second audio-visual signal at said remote location for observation by the patient simultaneously with transmission of the first audio-visual transmission; whereby said patient and said health practitioner are capable of substantially simultaneous interactive communication concerning said medical condition.
