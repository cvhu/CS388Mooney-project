A gas detector capable of accurately measuring particular components (odors or the like) contained in an ambient gas to be measured, being compact, and capable of being easily formed to be portable, or producing low noise and capable of being small-sized. Having zero gas cylinder (9) as a supplying unit of a zero gas and component parts disposed within its enclosure (2) and using syringe (3) as a gas intake/exhaust unit, it alternately introduces a test gas, i.e., an ambient gas taken in from outside enclosure (2) through piping (12a), and the zero gas supplied from zero gas cylinder (9) into sensor unit (7) and measures the test gas, while having operation of each unit controlled by data processor (11). Thus, accurate measurement of the test gas is achieved by relatively comparing results of measurement on the gases at each measurement. In addition, gas detector (1) can be moved to a spot where measurement is to be made to have the test gas there measured. Further, by use of a cylinder mechanism producing low noise, the detector can quantify gas intake/exhaust and can be made small in size.
