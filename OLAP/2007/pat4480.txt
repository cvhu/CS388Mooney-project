A Microscope Imaging System (CMIS) with intelligent controls is disclosed that provides techniques for scanning, identifying, detecting and tracking microscopic changes in selected characteristics or features of various surfaces including, but not limited to, cells, spheres, and manufactured products subject to difficult-to-see imperfections. The practice of the present invention provides applications that include colloidal hard spheres experiments, biological cell detection for patch clamping, cell movement and tracking, as well as defect identification in products, such as semiconductor devices, where surface damage can be significant, but difficult to detect. The CMIS system is a machine vision system, which combines intelligent image processing with remote control capabilities and provides the ability to auto-focus on a microscope sample, automatically scan an image, and perform machine vision analysis on multiple samples simultaneously.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for examining microscope specimens comprising the steps of: a) providing a video microscope having a holder for specimens and a camera located so as to be focussed on said holder and providing an output representative of the electronic image of said specimen; b) providing a light source operatively connected to said video microscope for illuminating said specimens being held in said holder; c) providing a robotic system responsive to electrical signals and operatively connected to and for positioning said video microscope; and d) providing a computer having a display terminal and operatively connected to said output of said camera and providing said electrical signals to said robotic system, said computer having operating programs comprising routines for providing machine vision techniques for autonomously scanning, identifying, detecting and tracking and displaying on said display terminal selected characteristics and features of said specimen, said machine vision techniques including routines for an adaptive morphological feature based object classifier employing a probabilistic feature mapping of objects in a selected image by utilizing no less than thirteen (13) feature metrics comprising; bounding box (FM1), intensity-weighted center of mass (FM2), intensity/color statistics (FM3) major axis length (FM4), minor axis length (FM5), major axis orientation, theta, (FM6), area (FM7), elongation (FM8), roundness (FM9), smoothness (FM10), partiality (FM11), circumference (FM12) and perimeter count (FM13), and wherein said routines for producing machine vision techniques comprise a routine that identifies one or more cells in an area of interest, which cell is closest to the center of the area of interest, the nearest neighbors of each cell within the area of interest, and track movement of the cells within the area of interest; said routine for said identification of all cells comprises the steps of: a) placing said one or more cells comprising a specimen in said holder; b) causing said video microscope to generate an electronic image of said one or more cells, each of said one or more cells of said electronic image having a dark outer ring; c) examining said dark outer ring of each cell so as to determine the shape and size of each of said one or more cells; and d) performing an intensity weighted center of mass technique utilizing the shape and size of each cell to determine the center of each cell which, in turn, defines the position of each cell relative to each other, wherein the area enclosing the positions of the one or more cells along with outer ring of each cell defining the perimeters of the one or more cells determines said area of interest.
