Various systems and apparatuses for processing a metal casting are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of producing a metal casting comprising: pouring a molten metal material into a mold to form a casting having a core aperture; applying energy to the casting to arrest cooling of the casting and at least partially heat treat the casting; removing the casting from the mold; clearing the core aperture of the casting; and heat treating the casting. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising maintaining the temperature of the casting at or above a process control temperature for the metal. 3. The method of claim 1, further comprising maintaining the temperature of the casting at or above a process control temperature for the metal until the casting is heat treated. 4. The method of claim 1, further comprising pre-heating the mold to a temperature of at least about the heat treatment temperature for the metal. 5. The method of claim 4, further comprising pouring the molten metal into the mold while the mold is at the pre-heated temperature. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein clearing the core aperture comprises punching, milling, drilling, lasering, or cutting a blockage within the core aperture, or blasting a fluid media at the blockage within the core aperture. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein clearing the core aperture comprises penetrating a blockage in the core aperture with an urging element as the casting is removed from the mold. 8. The method of claim 1, further comprising monitoring the temperature of the casting using a temperature measuring device in communication with the urging element.
