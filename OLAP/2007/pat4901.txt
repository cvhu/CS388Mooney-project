A printhead assembly is provided, comprising at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, and a support member supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and a casing in which the at least one printhead module is removably mounted by having a first side thereof slidably received in a longitudinally extending groove of the casing and a second side thereof clamped to the casing by a clamping arrangement.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly, comprising: at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, and a support member supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the at least two printhead integrated circuits; and a casing in which the at least one printhead module is removably mounted by having a first side thereof slidably received in a longitudinally extending groove of the casing and a second side thereof clamped to the casing by a clamp mounted to the casing, wherein the clamp is configured to constrain movement of the printhead module relative to the casing across the longitudinal direction of the casing and in the direction of printing fluid delivery from the nozzles to the print media, and to allow movement of the printhead module along the longitudinal direction of the casing. 2. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein: the at least one printhead module is formed as a unitary arrangement of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, the support member, at least one fluid distribution member each mounting one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits to the support member, and an electrical connector for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits; and the support member has at least one longitudinally extending channel for carrying the printing fluid for the printhead integrated circuits and includes a plurality of apertures extending through a wall of the support member arranged so as to direct the printing fluid from the at least one channel to associated nozzles in both, or if more than two, all of the printhead integrated circuits by way of respective ones of the fluid distribution members. 3. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein: the casing comprises a longitudinally extending channel portion within which the at least one printhead module is mounted, the channel comprising first and second side walls joined by a lower wall; the first side wall including the longitudinally extending groove and the longitudinally extending groove being formed between upper and lower longitudinally extending tabs; and the second side wall having a longitudinally extending upper surface upon which the second side of the at least one printhead module is mounted, the longitudinally extending upper surface having a height from the lower surface of the channel portion substantially equal to a height of the lower longitudinally extending tab of the first side wall. 4. A printhead assembly according to claim 3, wherein: the casing includes a support frame, incorporating the channel portion, and a cover portion; and the clamp engages with the support frame.
