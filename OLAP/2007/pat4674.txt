Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonucleotide 15 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding HIF1.alpha. (SEQ ID NO: 133), wherein said compound comprises at least 8 consecutive nucleobases of SEQ ID NO:446. 2. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein said antisense oligonucleotide is a DNA oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein said antisense oligonucleotide is an RNA oligonucleotide. 4. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein said antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 5. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 comprising at least one modified internucleoside linkage, sugar moiety, or nucleobase. 6. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 comprising at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 comprising at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. 8. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 comprising at least one 5-methylcytosine. 9. A method of inhibiting the expression of HIF1.alpha. in a cell in vitro comprising contacting said cell with the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1. 10. A kit or assay device comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1. 11. A composition comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 12. An antisense oligonucleotide with a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 446. 13. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 having 100% complementarity with the nucleic acid molecule encoding HIF1.alpha.. 14. An antisense oligonucleotide 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding HIF1-alpha (SEQ ID NO: 133), wherein said antisense oligonucleotide has at least 80% identity with SEQ ID NO: 446. 15. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 14 which is 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22 nucleobases in length and has at least 90% identity with SEQ ID NO: 446. 16. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 15 which is 19, 20 or 21 nucleobases in length and has at least 95% identity with SEQ ID NO: 446. 17. The antisense oligonacleotide of claim 12 comprising a central region of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides which is flanked on each side by five 2'-O-methoxyethyl nucleotides, wherein the internucleoside linkages of said oligonucleotide are phosphorothioate throughout the oligonucleotide and the cytidine residues are 5-niethylcytidines. 18. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 17.
