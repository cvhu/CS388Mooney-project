A self-running robot tracking and imaging a human body with an inexpensive arrangement includes: first to fourth sensors; a camera; a driving device moving the first to fourth sensors and camera simultaneously; a rotary encoder detecting that the first to fourth sensors and camera have stopped; a control unit which, upon detection of a heat source by one of the first to fourth sensors, controls the driving device such that the camera turns to the direction which the sensor detecting the heat source faced, and controls the camera so as to image an object after the camera has stopped, and controls the driving device such that the first to fourth sensors remain stationary for 3 seconds after the camera has stopped irrespective of whether a heat source is detected.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A self-running robot comprising: a plurality of first detection sensors detecting a heat source; a camera imaging an object on its optical axis; a moving device moving said plurality of first detection sensors and camera simultaneously; a second detection sensor detecting that said plurality of first detection sensors and camera have stopped; a first control device which, upon detection of said heat source by one of said plurality of first detection sensors, controls said moving device such that the optical axis of said camera is in the direction which that of the first detection sensors detecting said heat source faced; a second control device which controls said camera such that said camera images an object after said second detection sensor detects that said camera has stopped with its optical axis being in the direction which that of the first detection sensors detecting said heat source faced; and a third control device which controls said moving device such that said plurality of first detection sensors remain stationary for a predetermined time period after said second detection sensor detects that said camera has stopped with its optical axis being in the direction which that of the first detection sensors detecting said heat source faced. 2. The self-running robot of claim 1, wherein said plurality of first detection sensors include two or more sensors for detecting a heat source using the same construction, and said predetermined time period is not less than the time since said camera stops until an output of one of said two or more sensors is stabilized. 3. The self-running robot of claim 2, wherein said two or more sensors are pyroelectric sensors, and the time since said camera stops until the output of one of said two or more sensors is stabilized is 3 seconds.
