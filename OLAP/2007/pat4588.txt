Luciferase enzymes with greatly increased thermostability, e.g., at least half lives of 2 hours at 50.degree. C., cDNAs encoding the novel luciferases, and hosts transformed to express the luciferases, are disclosed. Methods of producing the luciferases include recursive mutagenesis. The luciferases are used in conventional methods, some employing kits.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule encoding a thermostable luciferase variant that retains at least 50% activity in aqueous solution for at least 2 hours at a temperature of about 50.degree. C., wherein the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid segment comprising SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:42, SEQ ID NO:46, or SEQ ID NO:43, or a portion thereof encoding a protein with the luminescent activity of a protein having SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:17, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:44, SEQ ID NO:47, or SEQ ID NO:45. 2. The isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule of claim 1 wherein the nucleic acid segment comprises SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:42, SEQ ID NO:46, or SEQ ID NO:43. 3. A vector containing the nucleic acid molecule of claim 1. 4. An isolated host cell, the genome of which is augmented with the nucleic acid molecule of claim 1. 5. The isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule of claim 1 which encodes a fusion protein comprising the thermostable luciferase variant. 6. The isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule of claim 1 wherein the nucleic segment comprises SEQ ID NO:42. 7. The isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule of claim 1 wherein the nucleic segment comprises SEQ ID NO:43. 8. The isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule of claim 1 wherein the nucleic segment comprises SEQ ID NO:46. 9. The isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule of claim 1 wherein the nucleic segment comprises SEQ ID NO: 11. 10. A method of using a vector encoding a luciferase, comprising: a) introducing the vector of claim 3 into a host cell; and b) detecting or determining the presence of luciferase in the host cell.
