A method determines axial alignment between the centroid of an end effector and the effective center of a specimen held by the end effector. The method is implemented with use of an end effector coupled to a robot arm and having a controllable supination angle. A condition in which two locations of the effective center of the specimen measured at 180.degree. displaced supination angles do not lie on the supination axis indicates that the centroid is offset from the actual effective center of the specimen.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of determining an axial alignment of a centroid of an end effector and an effective center of a specimen held by the end effector, the end effector implemented to have a controllable supination angle of rotation about a supination axis and operatively coupled to a robot arm that is positionable in at least two dimensions, comprising: causing the end effector to hold a specimen having an effective center; determining a first location of the effective center of the specimen; rotating the end effector holding the specimen through a supination angle of 180.degree. and determining a second location of the effective center of the specimen; and determining whether the first and second locations are in mirror image positions on opposite sides of the supination axis of rotation to assess whether the centroid is offset from the effective center. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising calculating an average of the first and second locations to determine an actual location of the centroid. 3. The method of claim 1, in which the specimen is a semiconductor wafer. 4. The method of claim 1, in which the end effector is of an edge grip type.
