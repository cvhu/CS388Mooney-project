Method and apparatus for testing of LCD panels is disclosed. An LCD panel under test is mounted to a translatable table between a polarization state generator and polarization state analyzer. For each location on the screen to be tested, a continuum of known polarization states are launched through the LCD screen and detected by the polarization state analyzer. Electrical signals representative of such polarization states are acquired by a computer. Within the computer, a model of polarization properties of the LCD panel is developed based on estimations of what the physical parameters of the LCD panel are believed to be. RMS differences between simulated polarization properties and measured polarization properties are minimized by iteratively refining the modeled physical cell properties, at which point cell thickness and other physical parameters of the LCD screen may be deduced.
