A method and apparatus for laser trimming a shaped plastic workpiece use a laser beam positioned and directed by a robotic arm traveling along a pre-programmed path to trim the edges of a workpiece held against a positioning block. Preferably, the positioning block includes a laser beam capturing channel comprising suction holes for removing smoke generated by the ablation and burning of the plastic so as to minimize the risk of smoke damage to the workpiece and to remove soot and vapors from the work area. At the same time, laser beams are inhibited form reflecting back off the block onto the workpiece by positioning the channel under the workpiece and along the predetermined cutting path.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of trim cutting a thin film laminate workpiece having a thickness of about 0.5 to about 4 mil comprising: (a) placing said thin film laminate on a work platform; (b) moving said platform to an enclosed housing; (c) providing a predetermined cutting path on said thin film laminate; (d) positioning a movable laser beam projector in said housing and adjacent said cutting path; (e) moving said projector along said predetermined cutting path while projecting photons therefrom, thereby cutting said thin film laminate along said cutting path; (f) providing a laser beam capturing groove under said laminate and parallel to said cutting path so that photons passing through said workpiece to perform said cutting will terminate in said groove without reflecting back onto said thin film laminate; and (g) providing a vacuum source adjacent said cutting path and under the laminate to draw volatiles and particulates away from said cutting path during said cutting and to help hold said laminate in place on said platform.
