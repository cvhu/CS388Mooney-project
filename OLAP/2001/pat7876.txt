A thin film layer can be formed on a glass substrate by preheating the substrate, depositing an amorphous silicon precursor layer on the substrate at a first temperature, and annealing the substrate in a thermal processing chamber at a second temperature sufficiently higher than the first temperature to substantially reduce the hydrogen concentration in the precursor layer. The preheating and annealing steps can occur in the same thermal processing chamber. Then the precursor layer is converted to a polycrystaline silicon layer by laser annealing.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of forming a film on each one of a plurality of substrates, comprising, for each one of said substrates, the sequential steps of: preheating said one substrate in a heating chamber to an elevated temperature; transferring said one substrate from the heating chamber to a vacuum chamber distinct from the heating chamber; depositing a film on said one substrate in the vacuum chamber; transferring said one substrate from the vacuum chamber to said heating chamber; and annealing said one substrate at an elevated temperature in said heating chamber; wherein, within said heating chamber, the preheating step is performed for a first plurality of substrates and concurrently the annealing step is performed for a second plurality of substrates distinct from the first plurality. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the temperature of the depositing step is about 380 to 400.degree. C. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the temperature of the preheating step is about 400 to 470.degree. C. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the film is an amorphous silicon layer. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein the film is a silicon oxide layer. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein no material is deposited on the substrate during the preheating step. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the heating chamber is not a deposition chamber.
