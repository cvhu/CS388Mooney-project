Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Her-4. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Her-4. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Her-4 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Her-4 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding Her-4, wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with a nucleic acid molecule encoding Her-4 and inhibits the expression of Her-4, and wherein said compound comprises at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 60, 64, 68, 69, 76, 78, 82, 83, 86, 88, 89, or 91. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of Her-4 in cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of Her-4 is inhibited.
