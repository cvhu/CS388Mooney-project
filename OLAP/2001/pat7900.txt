A method and apparatus for palletizing rectangular packages received in random size and weight. A "corner"-based modeling system is used to assist in evaluating possible placements of packages accumulated on a line conveyor, and a placement evaluation process is used to select a "best" package placement based on heuristic analysis. Statistically-based measurement and comparison is used to assist in the evaluation process.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for measuring the length of an accumulated package line comprised of a plurality of packages in line contact along their lengths, said apparatus comprising: a) an accumulating conveyor defining a reference end stop surface of known location and also defining a side alignment surface, said conveyor configured for accumulating said accumulated package line by accepting said plurality of packages along a load axis substantially parallel to said side alignment surface with the first accumulated package urged against said reference end stop, the side of at least one accumulated package against said side alignment surface, and the last package in said accumulated package line having an exposed end surface facing opposite the location of said reference end stop; and b) a distance-determining beam-generating sensor member configured to sense said exposed end surface of said last package in said accumulated package line, said beam-generating sensor member configured for generating a beam having a beam axis at an acute angle relative to said package path such that said last package can pass along said load axis without interfering with said sensor, yet said sensor member can sense the location of said package exposed end surface of said last package as well as the distance of said exposed end surface of said last package from said reference end stop. 2. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said distance-determining beam is at an acute angle relative to said load axis. 3. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising means for urging said packages into line compression. 4. An apparatus for measuring the length of an accumulated package line comprised of a plurality of packages in line contact along their lengths, said apparatus comprising: a) an accumulating conveyor defining a reference end stop surface of known location and also defining a side alignment surface, said conveyor configured for accumulating said accumulated package line by accepting said plurality of packages along a load axis substantially parallel to said side alignment surface with the first of said accumulated packages urged against said reference end stop, the side of at least one of said accumulated packages against said side alignment surface, and the last package in said accumulated package line having an exposed end surface facing opposite the location of said reference end stop; and b) a distance-determining sensor member configured to sense the distance of the nearest object along a sensing axis, said sensor member positioned relative to said accumulating conveyor such that said sensing axis and said load axis are at an acute angle such said last package in said accumulated package line can pass along said load axis without interfering with said sensor, yet when said last package intersects said sensing axis, said sensor member can determine the distance of said exposed end surface of said last package relative to said sensor; and c) a calculating device to determine the distance of said exposed end surface of said last package from said reference end stop.
