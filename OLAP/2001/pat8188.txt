Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of E2F transcription factor 1. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding E2F transcription factor 1. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of E2F transcription factor 1 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of E2F transcription factor 1 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding E2F transcription factor 1, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of E2F transcription factor 1 and wherein said antisense compound has a sequence comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 73, 74, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, or 88. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of E2F transcription factor 1 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in nitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of E2F transcription factor 1 is inhibited.
