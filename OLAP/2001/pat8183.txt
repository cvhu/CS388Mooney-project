Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Protein kinase C-theta. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Protein kinase C-theta. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Protein kinase C-theta expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Protein kinase C-theta are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleotides 35 to 55 of a 3'-untranslated region, nucleotides 76 to 117 of a start codon, nucleotides 139 to 2214 of a coding region, nucleotides 2196 to 2224 of a region which overlaps at least one nucleotide of a stop codon or nucleotides 2223 to 2743 of a 5'-untranslated region of a nucleic acid molecule encoding human Protein kinase C-theta, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human Protein kinase C-theta. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86 or 89. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 4 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 6 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 9. The antisense compound of claim 8 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 10. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 11. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 14. A method of inhibiting the expression of Protein kinase C-theta in human cells or tissues in-vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of Protein kinase C-theta is inhibited.
