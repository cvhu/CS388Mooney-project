The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the automatic receipt and distribution of products, such as parenteral products from a hospital pharmacy or specimen from a laboratory, through a pneumatic tube transport system. The system of the present invention includes a method and apparatus for the automatic receipt of a pneumatic tube carrier, the automatic opening of the carrier, the loading of a product into the carrier, the automatic closing of the carrier, and the automatic distribution of the carrier into a pneumatic tube transport system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for automatically coupling, labeling and loading products into pneumatic tube carriers and distributing said carriers via a pneumatic tube carrier system, wherein said apparatus comprises: at least one computer having a database, wherein said computer is capable of receiving information and transmitting said information; means for opening said carriers; means for inserting said products into said carriers, said means for inserting comprising at least one robot device, having at least one movable arm, at least one means for coupling products, and at least one means for labeling said carriers; means for closing said carriers; and means for moving said carriers between said means for opening, said means for inserting, and said means for closing; wherein said computer instructs said pneumatic tube carrier system to deliver an empty one of said carriers to said means for opening; wherein said means for opening receives and opens said carriers; wherein said means for inserting retrieves and inserts said products into said carrier; wherein said means for coupling is attached to at least one said movable arm and has sensors which indicate the presence or absence of said products; wherein said carriers are closed by said means for closing; and wherein said carriers are transported from said means for closing to said pneumatic tube carrier system for distribution to a predetermined destination. 2. An apparatus for automatically coupling, labeling and loading products into pneumatic tube carriers and distributing said carriers via a pneumatic tube carrier system, wherein said apparatus comprises: at least one computer having a database, wherein said computer is capable of receiving information and transmitting said information; means for opening said carriers comprising: a drive motor; a rotary motor; at least one rotary actuator for unlatching said carriers; at least one drive roll for aligning said carriers such that said carriers are aligned with said rotary actuator for said unlatching; and means for verifying said aligning; means for inserting said products into said carriers; means for closing said carriers; and means for moving said carriers between said means for opening, said means for inserting, and said means for closing; wherein said computer instructs said pneumatic tube carrier system to deliver an empty one of said carriers to said means for opening; wherein said means for opening receives and opens said carriers; wherein said drive motor controls each said drive roll and said rotary motor controls said rotary actuator; wherein said means for inserting retrieves and inserts said products into said carrier; wherein said carriers are closed by said means for closing; and wherein said carriers are transported from said means for closing to said pneumatic tube carrier system for distribution to a predetermined destination. 3. A system for automatically coupling, labeling and loading and distributing products to a predetermined destination via a pneumatic tube carrier system, wherein said apparatus comprises: at least one control means; a plurality of pneumatic tube carriers; a conveyor; a carrier opening device, comprising a drive motor, a rotary motor, at least one rotary actuator for unlatching said carriers, at least one drive roll for positioning said carrier such that said carriers are aligned with said rotary actuator, and an alignment means for verifying said positioning; a product transfer device; and a carrier closing device; wherein said carrier opening device inspects and opens said carriers; wherein said drive motor controls each said drive roll and wherein said rotary motor controls said rotary actuator; wherein said product transfer device retrieves said products and inserts said product into said carriers; and wherein said carrier closing device inspects and closes said carriers. 4. A method for the automatic distribution of a product through a pneumatic tube delivery system, said method comprising the steps of: inputting information into a control means; transmitting said information from said control means to a product transfer device and said pneumatic tube delivery system; opening a pneumatic tube carrier; selecting said product in accordance with said information; inserting said product into said carrier; closing said carrier; and transporting said carrier through said pneumatic tube system in accordance with said information; wherein said computer controls said selecting, said inserting, said opening, said closing and said transporting in accordance with said information; wherein a carrier handling means performs said opening and said closing, said carrier handling means comprising a drive motor, a rotary motor, at least one rotary actuator for unlatching said carrier, at least one drive roll for aligning said carrier such that said carrier is aligned with said rotary actuator, and means for verifying said aligning; wherein said drive motor controls each said drive roll and said rotary motor controls said rotary actuator; and wherein said product transfer device performs said selecting and said inserting.
