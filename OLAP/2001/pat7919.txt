Methods of using these compounds for modulation of MADH6 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of MADH6 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding MADH6, wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with a nucleic acid encoding MADH6 and inhibits the expression of MADH6 and wherein said compound has a sequence comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 17, 20, 34, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, or 49. 2. The compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of MADH6 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues vitro with the compound of claim 1 so that expression of MADH6 is inhibited.
