A substrate is roboticaly picked up at a station and transported to a measuring station to measure the distance to a reference. The substrate is aligned to a robot before measurement. The measured substrate is then transported to a pharmaceutical or diagnostic powder/grain deposition station where the powder/grains are controllably deposited on the substrate to predetermined thicknesses over a plurality of powder/grain collection zones. The deposited powder/grains are then measured to determine the thickness and area covered by the deposited powder/grains at each collection zone. The substrate is then transported to a lamination station and each collection zone of powder/grains is welded to a cover substrate. The system remembers which collection zones are out of specification so that they can be later selectively discarded.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A product comprising: a base substrate having a plurality of deposits each comprising a pharmaceutical active ingredient, the deposits being disposed on discrete regions of a first surface of the base substrate and being formed by generating an electrostatic force at said discrete regions, and directing a cloud of charged grains towards said first surface of the base substrate; and a cover substrate that overlies the plurality of depositions and is joined to the first surface of the base substrate by bonds that individually surround each of said depositions; wherein the active ingredient in each deposition is present in an amount that does not vary from a target amount by more than about 5 weight percent. 2. The product of claim 1, wherein the cover substrate has a planar form that includes a plurality of concavities, each concavity overlying a deposit, and further wherein the bonds individually encircle each concavity.
