Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of caspase 3. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding caspase 3. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of caspase 3 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of caspase 3 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. The antisense co pound up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecules encoding caspase 3, wherein said antisense compound comprises at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95,96, 97, 98, 101, 102, 103, 106, 107, 108, 113, 114, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 131, 133, 140, 142, 143, 146, 150, 151, 154, 159, 160, 164, 167 or 169 and wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of said nucleic acid molecule encoding caspase 3. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5.The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11.
