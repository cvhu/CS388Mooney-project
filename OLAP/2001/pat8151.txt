A system (10) for processing wafers and cleaning wafer cassettes (160, 260, 460) includes a work cell (12) having a plurality of processing stations (14) for processing wafers, and at least one processing/cleaning station (30, 130, 230, 430) for receiving and delivering wafers to and from a wafer cassette (160, 260, 460), a transfer mechanism (16) for moving the wafers between the plurality of processing stations (14) and the cleaning station (30). The cleaning station (30, 130, 230, 430) may have an exterior door (32, 132, 232, 432), an exhaust (34, 134, 234, 434), an interior door (40, 140, 240, 440), a plurality of gas nozzles (166, 266, 466) for delivering a sweeping gas over the wafer cassette (160, 260, 460). The cleaning process can also be done with a loaded cassette (160, 260, 460) that is unloaded before cleaning.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for processing wafers and cleaning wafer cassettes comprising a work cell wherein the work cell comprises: a plurality of processing stations for processing wafers; a cleaning station for receiving and delivering wafers to and from a wafer cassette and for cleaning a wafer cassette; a transfer mechanism for moving wafers between the plurality of processing stations and the cleaning station; and wherein the cleaning station comprises: a housing forming an interior chamber, an exterior door forming a portion of the housing for providing access to the interior chamber, an exhaust formed on a portion of the housing, an interior door forming a portion of the housing for providing access to the interior chamber, and a plurality of gas nozzles attached to a portion of the housing for delivering a sweeping gas to the interior chamber and over a wafer cassette placed within the interior chamber and to the exhaust for removal from the interior chamber. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein the exhaust is coupled to the exterior door and the plurality of nozzles are coupled to the interior door. 3. The system of claim 1 wherein the plurality of nozzles are coupled to the exterior door and the exhaust is coupled to the interior door. 4. The system of claim 1 wherein the plurality of nozzles are coupled to the exterior door. 5. The system of claim 1 further comprising an in situ particle monitor coupled to the exhaust. 6. The system of claim 1 further comprising a first remotely-controlled latch associated with the interior door for selectively opening and closing the interior door. 7. The system of claim 1 further comprising a first remotely-controlled latch associated with the interior door for selectively opening and closing the interior door; a second remotely-controlled latch associated with the exterior door for selectively opening and closing the exterior door; a flow control device fluidly coupled to the plurality of nozzles for controlling gas flow therein; and a control unit coupled to the flow control device for controlling gas flow to the plurality of nozzles to provide a pulsed flow.
