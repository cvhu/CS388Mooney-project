A robotic palletizing apparatus includes a conveyor and retractable product support having a support surface controllably extending beyond one end of the conveyor to support the bottom of an article beyond the conveyor end and retracting from the extended position such that the article supported thereon falls substantially flat from its otherwise supported condition.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic palletize apparatus comprising: a conveyor having first and second ends said conveyor second end being a product discharge end; an extendable and retractable product support device located at the second end of the conveyor and having a support surface controllably extending beyond said conveyor second end to support the bottom of an article outwardly of said conveyor second end, said support surface retracting from said extended position such that the article supported thereon falls substantially flat from its otherwise supported condition; and a delivery sensor in communication with the product support device. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 in which the conveyor is articulating. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 further comprising a product orientor. 4. The apparatus of claim 3 in which the product orientor comprises an orienting conveyor. 5. The apparatus of claim 1 in which the product support device comprises a tongue extender. 6. The apparatus of claim 5 in which the tongue extender comprises a tongue and pneumatic cylinder. 7. The apparatus of claim 1 in which the second end of the conveyor is angled relative to a gravitational plane. 8. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a product sensor along the conveyor whereby characteristics of a product may be ascertained. 9. The apparatus of claim 1 comprising a feed conveyor in proximal communication with the first end of the conveyor. 10. The apparatus of claim 1 comprising an orienting conveyor and a tongue extender.
