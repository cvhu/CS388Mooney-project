A vehicle, for driving over a ground surface, has a body with a left side, a right side, a front and a back. The vehicle includes left and right drive mechanisms. Each mechanism includes first and second traction elements for engaging the ground surface and transmitting a driving force between the vehicle and ground surface. Each mechanism includes first and second arms coupled to the first and second traction elements for relative rotation about first and second axis respectively. Each mechanism includes a rotor having a third axis, the rotor coupled to the body for rotation about the third axis and coupled to the first and second arms for relative rotation about the third axis. The mechanism includes first and second drive motors for driving the first and second traction elements and first and second transmissions, driven by the first and second motors and engaging the rotor. Driving the first and second traction elements simultaneously rotates the rotor relative to the first and second arms, respectively.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for maneuvering a vehicle, which vehicle includes: (a) a body having a left side, a right side, a front and a back; and (b) left and right drive mechanisms, coupled to said body, each of said left and right drive mechanisms comprising: a first traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface; a second traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface; a first arm, coupled to the first traction element; and a second arm, coupled to the second traction element, the method comprising: altering the height of one side of the body relative to the ground surface by: driving the first traction element on the one side in a first direction; and driving the second traction element on the one side in a second direction, opposite the first direction, so as to alter a separation between said first traction element and said second traction element and an angle between the first arm on the one side and the second arm on the one side. 2. A method for maneuvering a vehicle, which vehicle includes: (a) a body having a left side, a right side, a front and a back; and (b) left and right drive mechanisms, coupled to said body, each of said left and right drive mechanisms comprising: a first traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface; a second traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface; a first arm, coupled to the first traction element; and a second arm, coupled to the second traction element, the method comprising: altering a position of the body relative to the first traction element on one side by: driving the first traction element on the one side in a first direction; and maintaining the second traction element on the one side, so as to alter a separation between said first traction element and said second traction element and an angle between the first arm on the one side and the second arm on the one side, while a position of the second traction element on the one side remains fixed relative to the body. 3. A method for maneuvering a vehicle, which vehicle includes: (a) a body having a left side, a right side, a front and a back; and (b) left and right drive mechanisms, coupled to said body, each of said left and right drive mechanisms comprising: a first traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface; a second traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface, the method comprising: applying a first torque in a first direction to the first traction element on the one side; and applying a second torque in a second direction, substantially opposite said first direction, to the second traction element on the one side, said first torque and said second torque cooperating to alter a suspension geometry of the vehicle from a first stable condition to a second stable condition. 4. A method for maneuvering a vehicle, which vehicle includes: (a) a body having a left side, a right side, a front and a back; and (b) left and right drive mechanisms, coupled to said body, each of said left and right drive mechanisms comprising: a first traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface; a second traction element, to engage a ground surface and transmit a driving force between the vehicle and the ground surface, the method comprising: driving the first traction element on the one side at a first angular velocity; and driving the second traction element at a second angular velocity, differing from said first angular velocity, so as to alter a suspension geometry of the vehicle from a first stable condition to a second stable condition.
