A system and method for thermally processing a substrate. A substrate is heated to a processing temperature at which the substrate is susceptible to plastic deformation or slip. An insulating cover may be removed to initially cool the substrate below such temperature before removal from the system. Gas pressure may also be adjusted to enhance heat transfer during processing and decrease heat transfer prior to removal of the substrate. Susceptors or surfaces for cooling the substrate may also be included in the system. The substrate may be transferred from a heating surface to a cooling surface by moving or rotating the substrate through warm transitional regions to avoid slip.
