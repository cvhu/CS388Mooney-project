The present invention relates to a composition comprising a plurality of polynucleotide probes. The composition can be used as hybridizable array elements in a microarray. The present invention also relates to a method for selecting polynucleotide probes for the composition.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A composition comprising a plurality of polynucleotide probes comprising a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NOs:1-134. 2. A composition of claim 1, wherein each of the polynucleotide probes comprises a nucleotide sequence coding for proteins associated with cell proliferation. 3. A composition of claim 1, wherein each of the polynucleotide probes comprises a nucleotide sequence coding for receptors. 4. The composition of claim 1, wherein each of the polynucleotide probes comprises a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NOs:1-22. 5. The composition of claim 1, wherein the polynucleotide probes comprise a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NOs:22-134. 6. The composition of claim 1, wherein the polynucleotide probes are immobilized on a substrate. 7. The composition of claim 6, wherein the polynucleotide probes are hybridizable array elements in a microarray.
