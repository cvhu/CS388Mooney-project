A pair of opposing shoes are alternately and successively moved into and out of contact with a ring previously formed on a prophylactic device on a mandrel, whereby the mandrel or the shoes or both are moved in a direction during each time of contact of the shoes with the rolled portion of the device, for at least partially rolling the prophylactic device up toward its closed end, with the process being repeated until the prophylactic device is rolled up and off of the mandrel.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A takeoff mechanism for removing prophylactic devices formed on a plurality of mandrels mounted in an X-Y configuration on a pallet, comprising: elevator means retaining said pallet in a horizontal plane with said plurality of mandrels pointing downward, and being perpendicular to said pallet, respectively, for selectively raising and lowering said pallet; a first platform having a top side opposing said plurality of mandrels and parallel to said pallet, said first platform also having a bottom side; a plurality of left-hand shoe members mounted in an X-Y configuration perpendicular to and on the top side of said first platform; a second platform having top and bottom sides, said second platform having its top side opposing, spaced apart from but in close proximity to and parallel to the bottom side of said first platform; a plurality of right-hand shoe members mounted in an X-Y configuration perpendicular to and on the top side of said second platform, said right-hand shoe members projecting through holes in said first platform to be in paired relationship with and opposing individual ones of said left-hand shoe members, respectively; said second platform further including a plurality of holes adjacent said right-hand shoe members, and opposing respective ones of the holes in said first platform; shoe member operating means connected to said first and second platforms, for selectively moving said first and second platforms in opposite horizontal directions in a first mode for moving said pairs of right- and left-hand shoe members toward one another to a closed position, respectively, and in a second mode for moving said pairs of right- and left-hand shoe members away from one another to an open condition, respectively; a third platform having top and bottom sides, said third platform having its top side opposing and parallel to the bottom side of said second platform, and a plurality of holes through the top side that have diameters less than the maximum diameters of rolled up ones of said prophylactic devices, and that are opposing and substantially concentric with respective ones of the plurality of holes in said first and second platforms, whenever said pairs of left- and right-hand shoes are in an open condition; a fourth platform having a top and a bottom, said fourth platform having its top surface spaced from, and parallel to and opposing the bottom of said third platform; a plurality of rod-like air nipples mounted upon and with their longitudinal axes, respectively oriented at ninety-degrees to the top of said fourth platform; said plurality of pairs of left- and right-hand shoe members, said plurality of holes through said third platform, and said plurality of air nipples being of like number and arranged in substantially the same X-Y configuration as said plurality of mandrels; operating means for selectively raising and lowering said third platform to change its relative spacing with said second and fourth platform; air nipple table operating means for selectively raising and lowering said fourth platform to position said plurality of air nipples at or between two extreme first and second positions, said first extreme position being for lowering said fourth platform to maximize the space between said second and fourth tables, said second extreme position being for raising said fourth platform to move said plurality of air nipples through the center of said plurality of holes in said third platform, and through and beyond respective ones of said pairs of left- and right-hand shoes to a position where the tips of said air nipples extend beyond top ends of respective ones of said shoes; and control means programmed for controlling the operation of said elevator means, said shoe member operating means, and said operating means in a sequence of successive steps for removing said prophylactic devices from said mandrels in a manner leaving said prophylactic devices overlying and substantially concentric with respective ones of said plurality of holes of said third platform. 2. The takeoff mechanism of claim 1, further including: collection means for automatically collecting prophylactic devices overlying said plurality of holes, respectively, of said third platform, and delivering the prophylactic devices to a remote deposit point. 3. The take off mechanism of claim 2, wherein said collection means is an X-Y snapper for sucking the prophylactic devices through said plurality of holes of said third platform from the bottom thereof. 4. The takeoff mechanism of claim 3, wherein said X-Y snapper includes: at least one suction tube; at least one suction nozzle attached to an end of said suction tube; and means responsive to said control means for moving said at least one suction nozzle in an X-Y pattern beneath said third platform and proximate to the plurality of holes therein, for collecting prophylactic devices therefrom for transport to a remote collection point. 5. The takeoff mechanism of claim 4, further including: a plurality of suction tubes; and a plurality of suction nozzles attached to common ends of said suction tubes. 6. The takeoff mechanism of claim 5, wherein said suction nozzles are juxtaposed. 7. The takeoff mechanism of claim 3, further including: a plurality of takeoff inserts rigidly attached to the top1 of said third platform, and overlying said plurality of holes, respectively, of said third platform, said takeoff inserts each having a through hole concentric with the plurality of holes of said third platform, respectively, the holes of said takeoff inserts each being configured to partially unroll a said prophylactic device as it is being sucked therethrough via said X-Y snapper. 8. The takeoff mechanism of claim 7, wherein the holes of each of said plurality of takeoff inserts are chamfered to prevent damage to an associated prophylactic device and foster unrolling thereof as it passes therethrough. 9. The takeoff mechanism of claim 8, wherein the holes of each of said plurality of takeoff inserts have a diameter sized to maximize the extent of partial unrolling of a prophylactic device as it passes therethrough.
