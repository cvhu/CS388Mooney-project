A correct track calculating section calculates a correction amount in accordance with a reaction force acting on the working end of a robot. The correction amount is added to a given provisional target position so as to reduce the reaction force. When the reaction force increases excessively, an on-off switch is closed and a selector switch is switched to decelerate and stop the working end of the motor at a virtual position.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robot control system comprising: a reaction force detecting means for detecting a reaction force acting on a working end of a robot; a position correcting means for setting a position correcting amount corresponding to the reaction force detected by said reaction force detecting means; an adding means for producing a target position by adding said position correcting amount obtained by said position correcting means to a given provisional target position; a provisional target position correcting means for obtaining a virtual position of said working end of said robot based on a present target position generated from said adding means, said virtual position being a position where the reaction force detected by said reaction force detecting means becomes equal to a predetermined limit value; a switching means for sending said virtual position obtained by said provisional target position correcting means to said adding means instead of sending said given provisional target position when the reaction force detected by said reaction force detecting means exceeds a predetermined value smaller than said limit value; a position detecting means for detecting a present position of each articulated joint of said robot; and an actuating means for feedback controlling said articulated joint of said robot to shift said working end of said robot to said target position based on said position detected by said position detecting means. 2. A robot control system comprising an impedance control section and an action interrupt section, said impedance control section comprises: a reaction force detecting means for detecting a reaction force acting on a working end of a robot; a position correcting means for setting a position correcting amount corresponding to the reaction force detected by said reaction force detecting means; a target position generating means for producing a target position of the working end of said robot based on said position correcting amount obtained by said position correcting means; a position command generating means for sending a designated position of each articulated joint of said robot based on said target position of said working end; a position detecting means for detecting a present position of each articulated joint of said robot, and an actuating means for feedback controlling said articulated joint to eliminate a difference between said designated position sent from said position command generating means and said present position detected by said position detecting means, said action interrupt section comprises: an action interrupt judging means for checking whether said reaction force exceeds a predetermined threshold; a provisional target position correcting means, being responsive to the judgement of said action interrupt judging means, for obtaining a virtual position of said working end of said robot when said reaction force exceeds said predetermined threshold; and a switching means, being responsive to the judgement of said action interrupt judging means, for sending said virtual position obtained by said provisional target position correcting means to said target position generating means when said reaction force exceeds said predetermined threshold. 3. The robot control system in accordance with claim 2, wherein said virtual position is a position where the reaction force detected by said reaction force detecting means becomes equal to a predetermined limit value. 4. The robot control system in accordance with claim 2, wherein said threshold is smaller than said limit value.
