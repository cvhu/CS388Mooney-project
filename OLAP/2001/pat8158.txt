Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of SHP-2. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding SHP-2. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of SHP-2 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of SHP-2 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a 5' untranslated region, a start codon, nucleotides 298 through 1883 of a coding region, a stop codon, or a 3' untranslated region of human SHP-2 (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human SHP-2. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 10, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 46, 8, 12, 21, 25, 26, 31, 32, 41, 42, 44 or 45 which inhibits the expression of human SHP-2. 11. The antisense compound of claim 10 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 12. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 13. The antisense compound of claim 12 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 14. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 15. The antisense compound of claim 14 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 16. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 17. The antisense compound of claim 16 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 18. The antisense compound of claim 11 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 19. A method of inhibiting the expression of human SHP-2 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human SHP-2 is inhibited. 20. A method of inhibiting the expression of human SHP-2 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 3 so that expression of human SHP-2 is inhibited.
