An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 18, 25, 28, 31, 33, 34, 36, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46, 50, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 100, 102, 105, 106, 114, 120, 121, 127, 128, 130, 132, 133, 138, 139, 142, 146, 147, 150, 153, 154, 158, 164, 165, 166, 167, 175, 176, 179, 182, 202, 203, 206, 209, 210, 211, 214, 216, 217, 218, 219, 221, 222, 232, 236, 237, 238, 239 or 240 which inhibits the expression of human or mouse C/EBP beta. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of human or mouse C/EBP beta in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human or mouse C/EBP beta is inhibited.
