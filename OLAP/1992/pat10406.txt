An improved invention is provided having a propellant charge; propellant-taining bag or propellant-containing container which is coated with a composition for reducing muzzle flash and gun barrel erosion, the composition comprises sodium or potassium water glass and a volatile flash suppressant of NH.sub.4 HCO.sub.3, (NH.sub.4).sub.2 CO.sub.3 and/or KHCO.sub.3.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an improved munition for a gun comprising a propellant charge and a composition for reducing muzzle flash and gun-barrel erosion, the improvement consisting of water glass as an admixture with or adjacent grains of said propellant charge. 2. The munition of claim 1 wherein the water glass is NaO.XSiO.sub.2 and X in between about 3 to 5. 3. The munition of claim 2 wherein the water glass is about 4% by weight based on the weight of said propellant.
