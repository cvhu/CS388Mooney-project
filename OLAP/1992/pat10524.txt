A method and apparatus are disclosed for the transport of a homogeneous mixture of chopped fibers, wherein the fibers remain in a homogeneously mixed condition during their transport from a chopper gun to a workpiece, by use of two transvector apparatus placed in series with a conduit attached therebetween.
Claims We claim as our invention: 1. A method for the transport of a homogeneous mixture of chopped fibers from chopped fiber generation means to a workpiece, said method comprising the steps of: providing: first flow amplification means having an inlet opening and an outlet opening placed in fluid communication with said inlet opening, said inlet opening capable of receiving said chopped fibers from said chopped fiber generation means, said outlet opening capable of discharging said chopped fibers in an accelerated manner therethrough, conduit means having an inlet opening and an outlet opening in fluid communication with aid inlet opening, said inlet opening capable of receiving said chopped fibers from said outlet opening of said first flow amplification means, said outlet opening capable of discharging said chopped fibers therethrough, and second flow amplification means having an inlet opening and an outlet opening placed in fluid communication with said inlet opening, said inlet opening capable of receiving said chopped fibers from said outlet opening of said conduit means, said outlet opening capable of discharging said fibers in an accelerated homogeneous manner therefrom, establishing chopped fiber flow from said chopped fiber generation means sequentially through said first flow amplification means, conduit means and second flow amplification means by providing a compressed air supply means for the supply of compressed air to compressed air openings defined in each of said flow amplification means, and adjusting the pressure of said compressed air supplied to said compressed air openings of said first flow amplification means from about 2 to about 4 times the pressure of said compressed air supplied to said compressed air openings of said second flow amplification means, said chopped fibers flowing in an accelerated homogeneous manner from said outlet of said second flow amplification means toward said workpiece. 2. A method for the transport of a homogeneous mixture of chopped fibers from chopped fiber generation means to a workpiece, said method comprising the steps of: providing: first flow amplification means having an inlet opening and an outlet opening placed in fluid communication with said inlet opening, said inlet opening capable of receiving said chopped fibers from said chopped fiber generation means, said outlet opening capable of discharging said chopped fibers in an accelerated manner therethrough, conduit means having an inlet opening and an outlet opening in fluid communication with said inlet opening, said inlet opening capable of receiving said chopped fibers from said outlet opening of said first flow amplification means, said outlet opening capable of discharging said chopped fibers therethrough, and second flow amplification means having an inlet opening and an outlet opening placed in fluid communication with said inlet opening, said inlet opening capable of receiving said chopped fibers from said outlet opening of said conduit means, said outlet opening capable of discharging said fibers in an accelerated homogeneous manner therefrom, establishing chopped fiber flow from said chopped fiber generation means sequentially through said first flow amplification means, conduit means and second flow amplification means by providing a compressed air supply means for the supply of compressed air to compressed air openings defined in each of said flow amplification means, and adjusting the volume of compressed air supplied to said first flow amplification means from about one-fifteenth to about one-fortieth the total air flow through said inlet opening of said second flow amplification means, said chopped fibers flowing in accelerated homogeneous manner from said outlet of said second flow amplification means toward said workpiece. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein the supply of compressed air to compressed air openings in each of said flow amplification means is adjusted so that the pressure of said compressed air supplied to said compressed air openings of said first flow amplification means is from about 2 to about 4 times the pressure of said compressed gas supplied to said compressed air openings of said second flow amplification means.
