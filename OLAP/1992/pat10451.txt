A split sleeve (S) is deposited into a sleeve loader (24, 24'), with a lower end of the sleeve (S) on a sleeve support surface (154). A mandrel (M) carried by a puller tool (10, 10') is inserted into the sleeve loader (24, 24'), and through the sleeve (S), to position the sleeve (S) on a small diameter portion (50) of the mandrel (M), and an end portion of the sleeve (S) within a nosepiece (12), against a sleeve end contacting surface (66). The tool (10, 10') is moved away from the sleeve loader (24, 24') to pull the mandrel (M) out from the sleeve loader (24, 24'). Then the mandrel (M) is inserted into an opening (16) in a workpiece (14). The tool (10, 10') is moved endwise to place the sleeve (S) within the opening (16) and a workpiece contacting end surface of the nosepiece (12) into contact with the workpiece (14). The tool (10, 10' ) is then operated to retract the mandrel (M). This moves first an increasing diameter portion (52) and then a maximum diameter portion (54) of the mandrel (M) axially through the sleeve (S). In response, the sleeve (S) is expanded radially to compress the material immediately surrounding the opening. Grip surfaces (158) on end portions of nosepiece fingers (78) grip the sleeve (S). Following retraction, the tool (10, 10') is moved away from the workpiece (14) and the sleeve (S) is pulled out from the opening (16).
