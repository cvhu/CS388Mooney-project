A fill sensor for a paint gun provides a light sensor opposite a light source in a housing surrounding a transparent portion of paint gun overflow line so that reception by the light sensor of light radiated from the light source through the transparent portion of the overflow line is blocked when the paint gun is filled and the paint enters the overflow line, as indicated by a change from a first signal to a second signal from an electric circuit including the light snesor. A preferred embodiment of the invention uses a CdSe.sub.4 photo-resistor with a large aperture which is not blocked by small objects in the transparent portion of the overflow line and has a comparatively slow response for inherent signal low pass filtering. The electric circuit is adapted to operate through an intrinsically safe barrier for use in a manufacturing environment.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A fill sensor for a paint gun for use in an electrically isolated area of a manufacturing facility, the paint gun having a supply line from a source of liquid paint and an overflow line for disposal of excess paint having a transparent portion, the fill sensor comprising, in combination: a housing surrounding the transparent portion of the overflow line; a light source in the housing on one side of the transparent portion of the overflow line; a light sensor in the housing on another side of the transparent portion of the overflow line opposite the light source to detect radiation therefrom when the radiation is not blocked by paint in the transparent portion of the overflow line therebetween; a source of electric power and relay outside the electrically isolated area, the relay having an activating coil connected in series with the source of electric power and an armature activating a signaling device; a conductor connecting the source of electric power and activating coil outside the electrically isolated area with the light source and light sensor connected electrically in parallel within the electrically isolated area; and circuit means responsive to the light sensor receiving light from the light source while the transparent portion of the overflow line is not filled with paint for decreasing the electrical resistance in series with the activating coil to activate the relay and thereby provide a first signal from the signaling device and responsive to the light sensor not receiving light from the light source while the transparent portion of the overflow line is filled with paint for increasing the electrical resistance in series with the activating coil and thereby provide a second signal from the signaling device. 2. The fill sensor of claim 1 in which the light sensor comprises a CdSe.sub.4 light sensitive resistor having an aperture large compared with isolated objects in the overflow line and a low resistance when exposed to light. 3. The fill sensor of claim 1 in which the conductor crosses an intrinsically safe barrier separating the electrically isolated area from the remainder of the manufacturing facility. 4. The fill sensor of claim 3 in which the light source is an LED, a first resistor is connected in parallel with the activating coil, a second resistor is connected in series with the light source and a third resistor is connected in series with the light sensor.
