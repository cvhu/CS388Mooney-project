A circuit panel subassembly suitable for use in an eletromechanical apparatus includes a plurality of wires formed within an electrically conductive grid imbedded within a reaction injection molded panel which forms a part of the housing of the electromechanical apparatus. Wires are deployed in a pattern by using a wire organizing frame and the electrically conductive grid and the frame are subsequently imbedded in a reaction injection molded panel. Terminals attached to the ends of the wires remain exposed at spaced apart locations where components are to be mounted. Separate connector housings can be attached to the panel over the exposed terminals and other components or matable connectors can be attached thereto. The entire apparatus can be constructed robotically.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of making a molded electrical interconnection system, said method comprising the steps of: providing a frame having a pre-determined pattern; deploying first wires in said frame with ends thereof being bent outwardly from said frame; forming a panel with said wire ends protruding outwardly therefrom by injecting reaction injection molding material around said frame; attaching terminals to said wire ends; and mounting subcomponents on said panel and electrically connecting said subcomponents to said terminals. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said frame is place in a mold. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein second wires are positioned in the frame over said first wires. 4. The method of claim 3 wherein at least some of said second wires extend transversely relative to at least some of said first wires.
