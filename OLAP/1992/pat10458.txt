An automatic wheel assembly mounting system, for use on a vehicular assembly line, in which an array of fastener members is prepared, corresponding in number and geometric pattern to the array of coacting fastener members on the vehicle hub and to the array of bolt holes on the wheel assembly; a wheel assembly is rotated at an orientation station to bring the bolt holes into angular registry with the arrayed fastener members; the wheel assembly and arrayed fastener members are brought together and moved in registry to a staging position adjacent to but spaced laterally from a vehicle hub positioned at the wheel assembly mounting station on the assembly line and the arrayed fastener members, wheel assembly, and hub are relatively rotated to move the arrayed fastener members, the bolt holes in the wheel assembly, and the coacting fastener members on the hub into angular registry with each other at the staging position; the wheel assembly and arrayed fastener members are thereafter moved laterally onto the hub and the arrayed fastener members are secured to the coacting fastener members on the hub to secure the wheel assembly to the hub.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. An apparatus for assembling fasteners in a particular array for subsequent delivery to further fastener handling equipment, said apparatus comprising: (a) a source of fasteners; (b) a feeder mechanism having an outboard face; (c) means defining a plurality of fastener receptacles at spaced locations on said outboard face; (d) means operative to transport fasteners from said source for loading into each of said receptacles; and (e) means operative to move the loaded fasteners, in unison, away from said outboard face, whereby to deliver an array of fasteners to further fastener handling equipment disposed adjacent said outboard face. 2. An apparatus for assembling fasteners in a particular array for subsequent delivery to further fastener handling equipment, said apparatus comprising: (a) a source of fasteners; (b) a feeder mechanism having a plurality of parallel bores opening at spaced locations on an exposed outboard face of said mechanism; (c) a plurality of ejector assemblies respectively disposed in said bores; (d) means operative to supply fasteners from said source and position them on said outboard face adjacent to and in coaxial alignment with each bore opening; (e) means operative to move said ejector assemblies, in unison, outwardly in said bores to move the positioned fasteners, in unison, axially away from said outboard face, whereby to deliver an array of fasteners to further fastener handling equipment disposed adjacent said outboard face. 3. An apparatus for assembling fasteners in a particular array for subsequent delivery to further fastener handling equipment, said apparatus comprising: (a) a source of fasteners; (b) a drum member mounted for rotation about its central axis; (c) a conduit extending from said source to a discharge end located adjacent the periphery of said drum at an end face thereof; (d) a plurality of fastener receptacles formed at circumferentially spaced locations on said end face and each including a through axial bore and a radially extending passage communicating at its radially inner end with the axial bore and opening at its radially outer end adjacent the periphery of said drum member; (e) means for rotating said drum to bring successive receptacles into angular alignment with the discharge end of said conduit; (f) means for moving fasteners through said conduit and radially inwardly through the radial passage in each receptacle and into the axial bore of that receptacle as the receptacles are successively brought into angular alignment with the conduit discharge end, whereby to load the receptacles; (g) a plurality of parallel axially extending bores formed in said drum and respectively opening in said end face in axial alignment with the axial bore of a respective receptacle; (h) a plunger positioned in each bore; and (i) means for moving said plungers, in unison, axially in said bores to move said plungers into the axial bores in the receptacles and move the loaded fasteners, in unison, axially out of said receptacles and away from said end face, whereby to deliver an array of fasteners to further fastener handling equipment disposed adjacent said end face. 4. An apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said source of fasteners comprise nuts. 5. An apparatus for assembling fasteners in a particular array for subsequent delivery to further fastener handling equipment, said apparatus comprising: (a) a source of fasteners; (b) a drum member mounted for rotation about its central axis; (c) a fastener supply system extending from said source to a discharge end located adjacent to the periphery of said drum at an end face thereof; (d) a plurality of fastener receptacles positioned at circumferentially spaced locations on said end face and opening radially outwardly; (e) means for rotating said drum to bring successive receptacle into angular alignment with the discharge end of said fastener supply system; (f) means for moving fasteners through said fastener supply system and radially inwardly into each receptacle as the receptacles are successively brought into angular alignment with the fastener supply system discharge end, whereby to load the receptacles; and (g) ejector means for moving the loaded fasteners, in unison, axially out of said receptacles and away from said end face, whereby to deliver an array of fasteners to further fastener handling equipment disposed adjacent said end face. 6. An apparatus according to claim 5 wherein said ejector means comprises: (h) a plurality of parallel axially extending bores formed in said drum and respectively opening in said end face adjacent each receptacle; (i) an ejector assembly positioned in each bore; and (j) means for actuating said ejector assemblies, in unison, to eject the loaded fasteners. 7. An apparatus according to claim 6 wherein said ejector means includes assemblies for imparting a rotary movement to said fasteners as they are moved axially out of said receptacles, whereby to allow the fasteners to seek registration with suitable coacting receptacles on the further fastener handling equipment. 8. An apparatus according to claim 7 wherein said means for imparting rotary movement comprises a helical groove in each ejector assemblies and a driver pin engageable in each said groove so that the ejector assemblies are rotated as they are moved axially.
