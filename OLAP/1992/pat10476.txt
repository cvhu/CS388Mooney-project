A plurality of gripper modules positioned in space apart relationship along a frame member provide an end-of-arm tool. A pair of gripper modules disposed on opposite sides of the end-of-arm tool each support a Hall effect sensor which is coupled through a signal processing circuit to control the heads of the gripper modules.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An end-of-arm tool for transporting honeycomb core sections comprising in combination: a frame member; a plurality of spaced apart gripper modules distributed along said frame member; each of said plurality of spaced apart gripper modules having a pair of gripper head jaws; each of said pair of gripper head jaws having a plurality of pins; a pair of Hall sensors disposed on a pair of said plurality of spaced apart gripper modules for sensing the distance between said pair of gripper jaws; signal processing circuit means coupled to each of said pair of Hall sensors for sensing the movement of said gripper head jaws; and, means including a cylinder for ejecting a core section from said end-of-arm tool by retraction of said plurality of pins while simultaneously pushing said core section off of said plurality of pins.
