Machine operations are performed by a robot at a plurality of locations on a workpiece based on off-line data. The off-line data is corrected based on two levels of workpiece/robot alignment. First the robot determines the orientation of a fixture to which the workpiece is mounted by "touching-off" on known reference points (touchblocks) on the fixture. Coordinate data for the location of local features on the workpiece is corrected based on the first level of alignment and the positions of the local features are then sensed to provide a coordinate transformation for subsequent application to nominal machine operation location coordinates. The local features may be preassembly rivets and provide for individualized robot response on a workpiece-by-workpiece basis.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for accurately performing a machine operation at a plurality of locations on a workpiece with a robot that is under the direction of a controller, that comprises: mounting the workpiece in a predetermined manner to a fixture; providing a plurality of alignment points on the fixture; positioning the robot to measure the position of the alignment points and providing coordinate data to the controller indicative of the measured position of the alignment points; determining a first coordinate transformation based on the measured alignment point coordinates and storing said first coordinate transformation in the controller; providing at least two local features on the workpiece; providing nominal local feature coordinates to the controller indicative of the expected location in robot coordinates of the at least two local features on the workpiece; applying the first coordinate transformation to the nominal local feature coordinates to provide corrected local feature coordinates and storing the corrected local feature coordinates in the controller; positioning the robot in response to the corrected local feature coordinates to measure the actual position of the at least two local features on the workpiece and providing coordinate data to the controller indicative of the measured position of the at least two local features; determining a second coordinate transformation based on a comparison of the nominal local feature coordinates and the measured local feature position and storing the second coordinate transformation in the controller; providing nominal machine operation location coordinates to the controller indicative of the plurality of locations on the workpiece; applying the second coordinate transformation to the nominal machine operation location coordinates to provide corrected machine operation location coordinates and storing the corrected machine operation location coordinates in the controller. positioning the robot in response to the corrected machine operation location coordinates to perform the machine operation at the plurality of locations on the workpiece; and performing the machine operation at the plurality of locations on the workpiece. 2. A method for providing individualized robot response on a workpiece-by-workpiece basis according to claim 1, comprising: altering the positions of the at least two local features on a workpiece-by-workpiece basis, while leaving the nominal local feature coordinates unchanged. 3. A method for accurately performing a machine operation at a plurality of collinear locations on a workpiece with a robot that is under the direction of a controller, that comprises: mounting the workpiece in a predetermined manner to a fixture; providing a plurality of alignment points on the fixture; disposing the fixture to locate the workpiece within the robot's work envelope; positioning the robot to measure the position of the alignment points and providing coordinate data to the controller indicative of the measured position of the alignment points; determining a first coordinate transformation based on the measured alignment point coordinates and storing the first coordinate transformation in the controller; providing at least two local features on the workpiece; providing nominal local feature coordinates to the controller indicative of the expected location in robot coordinates of the at least two local features on the workpiece; applying the first coordinate transformation to the nominal local feature coordinates to provide corrected local feature coordinates and storing the corrected local feature coordinates in the controller; positioning the robot in response to the corrected local feature coordinates to measure the actual position of the at least two local features on the workpiece and providing coordinate data to the controller indicative of the measured position of the at least two local features; determining a line equation based on the measured positions of the two local features and storing the line equation in the controller; providing machine operation location data to the controller indicative of the number and spacing for the machine operations along the line for the plurality of collinear locations on the workpiece; applying the machine operation location data to the line equation to provide machine operation location coordinates and storing the machine operation location coordinates in the controller; positioning the robot in response to the machine operation location coordinates to perform the machine operation at the plurality of locations on the workpiece; and performing the machine operation at the plurality of collinear locations on the workpiece.
