Apparatus and methods for inserting leads of an electric circuit component into correspondingly arranged holes in a printed wiring board by (a) holding the component by a robotic arm adjacent the board so that its leads contact the board under pressure and are in nominal registration in the X and Y directions, and (b) subjecting the board to the combined effect of two vibrating motions which are respectively directed in these two directions, and of which one is superimposed on the other. These two motions are each controlled in frequency and amplitude and differ from each other in a motion characteristic whereby the leads sweep in two-dimensional patterns over board areas respective to their corresponding holes and centrally including them until the leads substantially exactly register with the holes to become inserted therein by the pressure on the leads.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for inserting a plurality of leads in a pattern into a corresponding plurality of holes formed in a substrate to extend therethrough from a surface thereof and arranged on said surface in a pattern corresponding in size and shape to said lead pattern, said method comprising, holding said leads adjacent said surface to be in contact therewith under pressure for a time period and to be in nominal registration with their respective holes, relatively moving in translation for said period said leads and substrate in two dimensions in the plane of said substrate to produce between said leads and substrate a relative translational vibration in said plane productive of a sweeping for said period of said leads while in said pressure contact with said surface, in two dimensional patterns over areas of said surface centrally including said holes until at the end of said period said leads register substantially exactly with said holes to thereupon be entered therein by said pressure, and, concurrently with said translational vibration, relatively moving angularly said pattern of leads and said substrate to produce between such lead and hole patterns a relative angular vibration superposed with said translational vibration and adapted to correct for any angular misregistration between said lead pattern and said hole pattern. 2. Apparatus for inserting leads arranged in a pattern into holes formed in a corresponding pattern in substrate and extending through such substrate from a surface thereof, said apparatus comprising: base means for apparatus, carriage means supported by said base means for mounting said substrate, lead positioning means coupled to said base means and operable while holding said leads to position them in said pattern in contact under pressure with said substrate for a time period and in nominal registration for said period with said holes, means to produce relative translational vibration for said period between (a) said positioning means and (b) said carriage means and the substrate thereon to produce a sweeping for said period of said leads while in pressure contact with said surface over areas thereof centrally including said holes and by such sweeping, to effect at the end of said period a substantially exact registration between said leads and holes and consequent insertion of said leads into said holes under said pressure, and means in a coupled relation with both said carriage means and lead positioning means and interposed in such relation between them to produce concurrently with said relative translational vibration a relative angular vibration between (c) said lead positioning means and said pattern of leads held thereby and (d) said carriage means and substrate with said pattern of holes therein so as to correct in the course of said translational vibration for angular misregistration between said pattern of leads and the corresponding pattern of said holes.
