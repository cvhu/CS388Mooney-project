A versatile robotic gripper is easily and quickly adjusted to grip objects of different geometrical shapes without changing parts and under complete machine control. Opposing jaws have a matrix of axially movable pins each of which is mechanically locked in any axial position. Actuation of an operating mechanism to move the jaws together to grasp an object depresses the pins and they collectively conform to the shape of the object; the jaws retain this shape upon release of the object. A plate is raised to unlock the pins which are returned by springs to a fixed coplanar position.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An adaptive gripping device for industrial robots and fixturing parts comprising: two substantially identical opposing jaw assemblies both having a matrix of axially movable gripper pins and means for biasing said pins to a fixed position; an operating mechanism on which said jaw assemblies are mounted to have opposing linear relative motion to grasp and release an object, and means for activating said operating mechanism to slide said jaw assemblies together causing individual pins to contact the object and be depressed and collectively conform to the shape of the object; each jaw assembly including pin locking means comprised of two locking mechanisms for each pin operating in opposite directions that mechanically lock the pin in any position within its range of motion when an axial force is applied to the pin, whereby said jaw assemblies retain the object shape after release of said object, and pin unlocking means actuated by power means for unlocking all of said pins which are returned by said biasing means to said fixed position. 2. An adaptive gripping device for industrial robots and fixturing parts comprising: two opposing jaw assemblies each having a matrix of axially movable gripper pins, and means for mechanically locking each pin in any position within its range of motion; an operating mechanism on which said jaw assemblies are mounted to have opposing linear relative motion to grasp and release an object, inward movement causing individual pins to contact the object and collectively conform to the shape of the object; each jaw assembly further including means for unlocking and returning all of said gripper pins to a fixed position; said pin locking means comprising identical locking mechanisms that operate in opposite directions, whereby said jaw assemblies retain the object shape after its release, and each locking mechanism is comprised of a locking plate having a keyhole-shaped hole, said gripper pin and a locking ball being received in larger and smaller portions of said keyhole-shaped hole and the latter having an angled surface, and spring means to press said ball between said pin and angled surface which form a wedge, whereby said pin is locked when an axial force is applied thereto in the uphill direction of the wedge. 3. The gripping device of claim 2 wherein said pin unlocking means is comprised of a stripper plate having a slot into which said ball protrudes in locked position, and means for moving said stripper plate and causing the edge of said slot to push each ball out of the wedge and unlock said pins. 4. The gripping device of claim 3 wherein said operating mechanism and both jaw assemblies are powered by pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders. 5. An adaptive gripping device for industrial robots and fixturing parts comprising: two identical opposing jaw assemblies each having a square array of axially movable gripper pins, means for biasing said pins to a fixed position with their ends coplanar, and means for mechanically locking each pin in any position within its range of motion in either direction; an operating mechanism on which said jaw assemblies are mounted to have opposing linear relative motion to grasp and release an object, means for activating said operating mechanism to slide said jaw assemblies toward each other causing individual pins to contact the object and be depressed and collectively conform to the shape of the object and retain this shape after its release; each jaw assembly further including pin unlocking means actuated by power cylinders, said biasing means returning said pins to said fixed position; said pin locking and unlocking means being comprised of two locking plates having keyhole-shaped holes and a stripper plate having an elongated slot, said gripper pin passing through larger diameter portions of said keyhole-shaped holes and through said slot, a locking ball received in a smaller diameter portion of each hole which has an angled surface, spring means to press each ball between a wedge formed by said angled surface and pin, whereby said pin is locked when an axial force is applied in the uphill direction of the respective wedge, each ball protuding into said slot in locked position, and means for moving said stripper plate so that the edge of said slot pushes each ball out of the respective wedge and unlocks said pin. 6. The gripping device of claim 5 wherein the last-mentioned means comprises pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders that operate cams which engage the edges of holes in said stripper plate and raise and lower said stripper plate.
