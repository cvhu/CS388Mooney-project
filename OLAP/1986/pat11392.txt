An apparatus (24) for gripping a multilead article (18) and inserting the leads (20--20) thereof into corresponding apertures (22) in a printed circuit board (12) comprises a plate (26) underlying a block (30) spring biased thereagainst. The block (30) has a pair of parallel, spaced-apart jaws (38, 40) mounted to opposite sides thereof so as to depend below the plate. At least one jaw (40) is movable towards or away from the other to capture the article (18) therebetween. The jaws (38, 40) each have one of a pair of opposing combs (50) thereon, each comb having spaced-apart slots (52) therein for seating each of the leads of the article captured between the jaws. To insert the article (18), the gripping apparatus (24) is moved by a robot arm (29) to a predetermined location above the circuit board (12) so that each slot (52) in each comb (50) is aligned with a corresponding aperture (22). The article (18) is forced from the apparatus (24) so that the leads (20--20) thereof are guided along the slots (52--52) and into the apertures (22--22) in the board (12).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for inserting each of a plurality of flexible leads depending from opposed sides of an article into corresponding apertures in a substrate comprising the steps of: releasably gripping the article between a pair of opposed, parallel, spaced jaws having opposed depending combs which have spaced slots therein, each slot including an elongated upper section whose cross-section is half-rounded and a tapered lower section, to seat the tip of each lead article in the upper section of a separate one of the slots in the combs; positioning the jaws to locate the combs proximate the substrate so that the tapered lower section of each slot in each comb is aligned with a corresponding aperture in the substrate; applying a force to the article to urge the tip of each lead from the upper section into, and along the lower section of, each slot so that the tips of the leads are guided into the corresponding aperture in the substrate; and releasing the article once all the tips of the leads thereof have been inserted into the corresponding apertures in the substrate by moving the jaws laterally apart. 2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of positioning the jaws to locate the combs proximate the substrate comprises the step of bringing the combs into contact with the substrate. 3. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of positioning the jaws to locate the combs proximate the substrate comprises the step of bringing the combs to a position spaced from the substrate at a distance less than the length of the leads. 4. Apparatus for inserting each of a plurality of flexible leads depending from opposed sides of an article into corresponding apertures in a substrate comprising: a body having first and second opposed sides; a first jaw mounted to and depending from the first side of said body for gripping one of the opposed sides of the article; a second jaw slidably mounted to, and depending from said second opposed side of said body so as to be opposite to said first jaw for contacting the other opposed side of the article; means connected between said body and said second jaw for moving said second jaw towards said first jaw to capture the article therebetween; the first and second jaws having opposed combs thereon, each comb having spaced slots therein, the slots each having an upper substantially elongated section whose cross-section is half-rounded and a lower tapered section, the slots guiding the tips of the leads of the captured article into corresponding apertures in the substrate; and means slidably mounted to said body for urging an article captured between the first and second jaws towards the substrate to move the tip of each lead along the slot and into the corresponding in the substrate. 5. The invention according to claim 4 wherein the lower tapered section of each slot leads into a notch at the bottom thereof. 6. Apparatus for inserting each of a plurality of flexible leads depending from opposed sides of an article into corresponding apertures in a substrate comprising: a body having first and second opposed sides; a first jaw mounted to, and depending from the first side of the body for contacting one of the opposed sides of the article; a second jaw slidably mounted to, and depending from said second opposed side of said body so as to be opposite to said first jaw for contacting the other opposed side of the article; means connected between said body and said second jaw for moving said second jaw towards said first jaw to capture the article therebetween; the first and second jaws having opposed combs thereon, each comb having spaced slots therein, the slots each having a substantially elongated upper section whose cross section is half-rounded and a lower tapered section, the slots guiding the tips of the leads of the captured article into corresponding apertures in the substrate; a plate underlying said body so as to be located between said first and second jaws; first and second pins each fastened to and projecting upwarding from said plate into a separate one of a pair of pin recieving apertures in said body so as to extend therebeyond; first and second springs each carried by, and mounted to, said first and second pins, respectively, so as to contact said body for urging said plate against said body; a resilient sheet secured to and spaced from the undersurface of said plate; a pair of strips each depending from opposed edges of said sheet; and moving means carried by said body and attached to said plate for displacing said plate from said body to urge the article captured between said first and second jaws towards the substrate and thereby move the tip of each lead along the slot and into the corresponding apertures in the substrate. 7. The invention according to claim 6 wherein said moving means comprises: a cylinder within said body; a piston reciprocally disposed within said cylinder and attached to said plate; a circular bellows clamped at its center to the piston and clamped at its edges to said cylinder in which said piston is located; and means in said body for admitting pressurized fluid into said cylinder against said bellows to force said piston from said cylinder.
