A stationary robotic base carries a movable robotic platform and supports a pair of vertical striker plates spaced apart by a central, elastomeric block. The striker plates are confined within a compartment of the stationary base, and extend upward into a pathway defined by a lug depending from the moving platform. The lug contacts the top portion of a given striker plate and, as the plate is struck, it tends to pivot about its bottom edge toward the other plate, compressing the elastomeric block, while the other plate is held from moving away from the block. The assembly is bidirectional, with each striker plate being yieldable toward the other as it is encountered by the moving lug. In the event that the moving element possesses more energy than the maximum stopping energy of the elastomeric block, the first encountered striker plate will pivot to such position that the lug will overtravel the striker plate and pass over the elastomeric block until it comes to rest against the stationary, nonpivoting striker plate.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a robot having a relatively stationary base and a relatively moving base, improved means for controlling deceleration and stopping of said moving base, comprising: (a) a lug affixed to, and depending from, said moving base, said lug defining a lug path while moving; (b) an elastomeric block supported on said stationary base, said base having means for rigidly backing said block, said block being located in line with said lug path and interposed between said lug and said means for rigidly backing said block; (c) a striker plate having an impact surface and an edge defined around said surface, said plate being located next to said block and edge-wise supported on said stationary base with a portion of said impact surface extending into said lug path between said elastomeric block and said lug; and (d) means for permitting substantially pivoting of said striker plate about its supported edge as said plate is contacted by said lug. 2. In a robot having a relatively stationary base and a relatively moving base, improved means for controlling bidirectional deceleration and stopping of said moving base, comprising: (a) impact lug means affixed to, and depending from, said moving base defining a lug path while moving; (b) a base compartment having a pair of rigid opposing sidewalls; (c) an elastomeric block disposed in said base compartment between said walls and aligned with said lug path; and (d) a pair of striker plates, each having an impact surface and an edge defined around said surface, each said plate supported in said compartment on at least one edge, adjacent a respective one of said walls and disposed between said walls and said elastomeric block, and wherein a portion of said impact surface of each plate extends into said lug path; whereby said plates are alternatively pivotally movable in opposing directions toward one another against said elastomeric block, and said plates are rigidly held in opposing directions away from one another, so that, as a respective one of said plates is contacted by said impact lug and pivotally moved in one direction against said block, the non-contacted plate is rigidly held from pivoting in the same direction.
