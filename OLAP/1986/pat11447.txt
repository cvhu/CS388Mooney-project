There is provided a device for programming motions and operational forces or torques of a robot, and a device for carrying out the method. The device includes a handle grip-sensor unit which includes a known sensor of forces and/or torques of the type which defines a load pick-up plate connected via spokes to a peripheral ring and via upright supports to a rigid base part. The peripheral ring is connected to an inner wall of a hollow body whose outer wall is shaped to match the contours of the human hand. The base part is rigidly connected either to an inertial platform or to an end link of the robot. The output of the sensor is connected to link driving means of the robot via a data-processing unit which converts the output signals from the sensor into data corresponding to forces or torques applied by the operator to the handgrip-sensor unit. The data-processing unit includes an algorithm which converts the output signals from the sensor into drive commands for the joint drives of the robot and adjusts the system of coordinates of the handgrip-sensor unit to the system of coordinates of movements of an actuator on the end link of the robot.
Claims We claim: 1. In a device for programming motions, forces, and torques of an articulated robot having an end link provided with an actuator, including driving means for imparting translational and rotary movements to the end link, and control means for applying control commands to the driving means to move the last link according to a system of coordinates, the improvement comprising a hand grip sensor unit assembled of a force momentum sensor having a deformable measuring part and a rigid base part, and a hollow spherically configured body formed of a rigid plastic material with an opening therein for the base part of the sensor and an inner surface portion rigidly connected to the measuring part of the sensor, said spherical body being assembled of two rigidly connected hemispheres, said opening being formed in one hemisphere defining a center axis normal to the separation plane of the two hemispheres, an annular groove formed in the inner surface portion extending in the separation plane of the two hemispheres and the measuring part of the sensor having a ring shaped portion which fits snugly into said annular groove, and the measuring part of said sensor includes a load pick-up plate connected to said ring by uniformly distributed spokes and further being connected to said base part of the sensor by straight supports which are directed at right angles to said spokes so that the measuring center point of the entire hand grip-sensor unit is located in the center point of the spherical hollow body and in the separation plane of the two hemispheres.
