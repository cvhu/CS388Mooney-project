An automated robotic quick change force controlled arbor device particularly to apply a sanding disk to surface finish metal and an automatic replacement of the disk.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated robotic force controlled force polishing apparatus, having in combination a polishing apparatus, an arbor mounted abrasive disk carried by said apparatus, sliding means supporting said apparatus, a controlled power source operating said sliding means, means carrying a plurality of stacks of said disks, a disk escapement mechanism in connection with a disk retainer. means aligning a stack of said disks with said escapement mechanism, a sensor indicating a completion of said alignment, said sensor causing said escapement mechanism to release a disk to said retainer, and means causing said apparatus to receive said disk as a replacement for said released disk. 2. The structure of claim 1, wherein said sliding means comprises a pair of air operated cylinders, a housing, said cylinders disposed in said housing in a side by side arrangement, a pair of upstanding walls within said housing supporting said cylinders, a pair of transversely spaced shafts extending parallel to said cylinders respectively outwardly thereof extending through said upstanding walls, a bearing assembly adjacent each of the ends of said shafts, a bearing plate extending between each of the transversely opposed of said bearing assemblies, a sliding plate member, mounting blocks upstanding from said bearing plates supporting said sliding plate member and said sliding plate member supporting said polishing apparatus, a top wall of said housing having an elongated opening therein, said mounting blocks extending through said opening having longitudinal movement therein, said cylinders having pistons respectively secured to said bearing plate, one of said cylinders having its piston moving a bearing plate with its respective bearing assemblies and the sliding plate supported thereby, and the others of said cylinders retracting the other of said bearing plates and the bearing assemblies related thereto counterbalancing the weight of said polishing apparatus in its vertical position. 3. The structure of claim 1, wherein arbor having said abrasive disk releasably mounted therein, an inner collet having tool gripping fingers to engage the arbor of said abrasive disk, a collet enclosing said inner collet enclosing to apply a gripping force to said fingers or being withdrawn therefrom to release said fingers, and mean including pneumatic pressure operating said collet. 4. The structure of claim 1, wherein said sliding means comprises a housing, a pair of air cylinders in said housing in parallel arrangement, means supporting said cylinders, a pair of shafts parallel to and respectively outwardly of said cylinders extending through and supported by said supporting means, said shafts supporting bearing assemblies adjacent their ends and slidable thereon, the transverse pairs of said bearing assemblies having bearing plates therebetween, means supporting said polishing apparatus being supported by said bearing plates, said cylinders respectively having their pistons secured to opposite of said bearing plates, a controlled pressure air supply respectively operating each of said cylinders, whereby one of said cylinders moves a bearing assembly and said sliding member and the other of said cylinders offsets the weight of said polishing apparatus by retracting its piston. 5. A polishing disk feeding apparatus in connection with a polishing apparatus, comprising a plurality of tubular magazines having their lower ends inserted into a magazine sleeve, an escapement mechanism carried by said apparatus, an indexing plate aligning a magazine with said escapement mechanism, a disk retainer, a magazine position sensor indicating that said alignment is completed, an arbor disk in a feed ready position, and means signaling such a position.
