A light weight conventional robot and method for use in connection with the surface preparation of large objects. The robot has a tool attached to an object flange which is supported by a collapsible member, allowing the tool to move to and fro. The member is pivotally mounted to a base so that the tool may be manipulated in all directions. There are at least three independently mountable blocks which allow the robot to be easily adapted to the work envelope without any change to the envelope itself. Tensile members connect the mounting blocks to the object flange to control the movement of the tool. The tensile members may be one continuous non-accumulating member or separate members which respectively allow the robot to move in two or three degrees of freedom, by varying the length of each member.
