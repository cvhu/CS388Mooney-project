An end effector having an individually positionable piston formed directly onto a movable pipe with one end of the movable pipe connected to a common plenum chamber and the other end to a bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup with the movable pipe forming an elongated air evacuation chamber to permit quick evacuation and pickup of an article located proximate the bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup and a stabilizer located proximate the bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup to act as a stop to prevent swaying of the article as the bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup is moved from one position to another.
Claims I claim: 1. An end effector housing carrying a pair of end effectors for picking up articles through air pressure differential across the articles comprising: a plenum chamber; a first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup for directly contacting a first article to be picked up, said bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup having a central passage therein; a first stabilizer located proximate said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup to act as a stop to prevent an article carried by said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup from moving with respect to said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup as said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup is moved from place to place with said first stabilizer and said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup located on the same side of an article to be picked up; a first movable pipe having a first end connected to said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup, said first movable pipe having a second end and an intermediate region; a first flexible hose having a first end and a second end with said first end connected to said plenum chamber and said second end connected to said second end of said first movable pipe to form an elongated air evacuation chamber for rapid air evacuation from said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup; a second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup for directly contacting a first article to be picked up, said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup having a central passage therein; a second stabilizer located proximate said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup to act as a stop to prevent an article carried by said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup from moving with respect to said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup as said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup is moved from place to place with said second stabilizer and said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup located on the same side of an article to be picked up; a second movable pipe having a first end connected to said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup, said second movable pipe having a second end and an intermediate region; a second flexible hose having a first end and a second end with said first end connected to said plenum chamber and said second end connected to said second end of said second movable pipe to form an elongated air evacuation chamber for rapid air evacuation from said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup; a first annular piston located around and secured to said intermediate region of said first movable pipe; a first housing having a chamber therein, said first annular piston slidable in said chamber of said first housing with said first annular piston coacting with said chamber of said first housing to define an upper and a lower compartment in said chamber of said first housing so that when air pressure in the upper compartment of said first housing exceeds the air pressure in the lower compartment of said first housing, the first annular piston slides in said chamber of said first housing to move said first movable pipe in a first direction and when the air pressure in the lower compartment of said first housing exceeds the air pressure in the upper compartment of said first housing, the first annular piston slides in said chamber of said first housing to move said first movable pipe in a second direction opposite said first direction; a second annular piston located around and secured to said intermediate region of said second movable pipe; and a second housing having a chamber therein, said second annular piston slidable in said chamber of said second housing with said second annular piston coacting with said chamber of said second housing to define an upper and a lower compartment in said chamber of said second housing so that when air pressure in the upper compartment of said second housing exceeds the air pressure in the lower compartment of said second housing, the second annular piston slides in said chamber of said second housing to move said second movable pipe in a first direction and when the air pressure in the lower compartment of said second housing exceeds the air pressure in the upper compartment of said second housing, the second annular piston slides in said chamber of said second housing to move said second movable pipe in a second direction opposite said first direction with said first flexible hose connected to said first movable pipe and said second flexible hose to said second movable pipe to permit lifting articles from a surface by rapidly drawing air through said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup and said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup to thereby quickly provide a pressure differential across an article when an article to be lifted is located proximate said bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cups so that said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup and said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup can simultaneously pick up different articles for transport to a second location. 2. The end effector housing of claim 1 wherein said first stabilizer located proximate said first bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup is carried by said first movable pipe and said second stabilizer located proximate said second bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup is carried by said second movable pipe with each of said stabilizers located peripherally outward of said bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cup. 3. The end effector housing of claim 2 including a detachable housing for connecting said end effector housing to a movable arm for positioning said bellows-shaped collapsible vacuum cups proximate articles to be picked up.
