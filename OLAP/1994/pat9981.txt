Nonlinear control method is provided for a closed-loop trajectory in a control system of the form x=.function.(x)+u through a sliding surface, s, chosen such that s=e+.lambda.e=, where e is the trajectory, and .lambda. is a positive constant using a control law of the form ##EQU1## which exploits terminal attractors of the form ##EQU2## where .alpha. is a constant greater than zero, .beta..sub.n, .beta..sub.d =(2i+1), where i belongs to the set of positive integers chosen for .beta..sub.n and .beta..sub.d, and .beta..sub.d >.beta..sub.n for convergence in finite time. For a system in which an initial S.sub.i is zero, a control law is used of the form ##EQU3## which yields a control equation ##EQU4## where .delta..sub.n, .delta..sub.d =(2i+1), wherein i belongs to the set of positive integers chosen for .delta..sub.n and .delta..sub.d, and .delta..sub.d >.delta..sub.n for retaining convergence in finite time.
