The gripper mechanism includes two fingers hingeably attached to a support and operable by means of a spring to grasp an object with a predetermined amount of force and a solenoid to open the fingers and release the object The gripper mechanism is enclosed by a substantially rectangular box-like enclosure which includes a plurality of compliant guides to align and support an object retrieved from an object storage location by the finger gripper mechanism. Each of these four guides consist of an elongated L-shaped guide finger that is attached to the enclosure by a spring mechanism to enable the guide finger to translate in directions that are normal to the opening in the enclosure. The end of the guide fingers adjacent the opening in the enclosure support the object as it is being retrieved and are tapered in order to provide a funneling capability to account for misalignments between the object that is retrieved and the precise center lines of the enclosure. The spring mechanism also functions to automatically reposition the object once it clears the object storage location to a position that is substantially centered within the enclosure.
Claims We claim: 1. In an object handling system that includes a robotic manipulator for transporting objects, an object retrieval apparatus, located at an end of said robotic manipulator, for retrieving an object from an object storage location comprising: means for gripping said object to securely hold said object; means for translating said gripping means in a direction to remove said object from its object storage location; means for supporting said object as it is being removed from said object storage location to reduce a force required to be applied to said object by said gripping means to hold said object, comprising: a plurality of rails aligned parallel to each other and configured to form a pocket into which said translating means moves said gripping means when said gripping means moves in a direction to remove said object from its object storage location, wherein each of said rails has a first end, proximate to said object storage location, tapered to funnel said object from said object storage location into contact with said plurality of rails; and means, connected to said supporting means, for automatically positioning said object, once removed from said object storage location into said supporting means, substantially in alignment with a predetermined locus on said object retrieval apparatus. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said automatically positioning means comprises: a plurality of springs, each of which is attached to a corresponding one of said rails, deformable from a preloaded position substantially in alignment with said predetermined locus on said object retrieval apparatus by said object being loaded into said supporting means from said object storage location and which apply a force to said object in a direction opposite said deformation to place said object substantially in alignment with said predetermined locus on said object retrieval apparatus once said object is removed from said object storage location. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 further comprising: means for enclosing said supporting means and said automatically positioning means to provide a rigid frame of reference for said supporting means and said automatically positioning means; and wherein each of said plurality of springs have a first end and a second end, where said first end is attached to said enclosing means and said second end is attached to said corresponding rail. 4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said object comprises a substantially rectangular box-like structure, said plurality of rails comprise four rails, aligned to contact a corresponding one of four edges of said substantially rectangular object as said substantially rectangular object is withdrawn from said object storage location. 5. In an object handling system that includes a robotic manipulator for transporting objects, an object retrieval apparatus, located at an end of said robotic manipulator, for retrieving an object from an object storage location comprising: means for gripping said object to securely hold said object; means for translating said gripping means in a direction to remove said object from its object storage location; and means for automatically positioning said object as it is removed from said object storage location to a position substantially in alignment with a predetermined locus on said object retrieval apparatus, comprising: a plurality of rails aligned parallel to each other and configured to form a pocket into which said translating means moves said gripping means when said gripping means moves in a direction to remove said object from its object storage location, wherein each of said rails has a first end, proximate to said object storage location, and tapered to funnel said object from said object storage location into contact with said plurality of rails. 6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said automatically positioning means further comprises: a plurality of springs, each of which is attached to a corresponding one of said rails, deformable from a preloaded position substantially in alignment with said predetermined locus on said object retrieval apparatus by said object being loaded into said automatically positioning means from said object storage location, and which apply a force to said object in a direction opposite said deformation to place said object substantially in alignment with said predetermined locus on said object retrieval apparatus once said object is removed from said object storage location. 7. The apparatus of claim 6 further comprising: means for enclosing said automatically positioning means to provide a rigid frame of reference for said automatically positioning means; and wherein each of said plurality of springs have a first end and a second end, where said first end is attached to said enclosing means and said second end is attached to said corresponding rail. 8. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said object comprises a substantially rectangular box-like structure, said plurality of rails comprise four rails, aligned to contact a corresponding one of four edges of said substantially rectangular object as said substantially rectangular object is withdrawn from said object storage location.
