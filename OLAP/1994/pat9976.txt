A segmented tool rack having a plurality of individual bays to retain tool heads for an automated selection by a robotic arm, the tool heads being positively locked in the tool rack and upon selection by a robotic arm, the tool head remains in locked position until locked-onto the robotic arm at which time it is unlocked from the tool rack avoiding the possibility of an accidental dropping of a tool head and further, the tool head remains locked in position on said rack in the event of a loss of power.
Claims What is claimed is 1. In connection with an automatic tool changing system, a tool rack releasably holding tool heads, having in combination a plurality of tool holding segments, a bay member disposed in one of said segments, a tool holder adapted to be releasably received in said bay member, a tool head secured to said tool holder, a wrist member adapted to have attachment to a robot arm, said wrist member being adapted to overlie said tool holder, latch members respectively at each side of said tool holder, means urging said latch members into latching position, operative means moving said latch members to unlatching position to receive said wrist member, means retaining said tool holder in said bay member while latch members are in unlatching position, said operative means releasing said latching members to latch said wrist member and release said tool holder, whereby said robot arm lifts said wrist member and tool holder from said bay member for application to a work effort. 2. The structure of claim 1, wherein said latch members each comprise an angled plate member having an upstanding end wall and a bottom plate, a recess in said tool holder at each end thereof to receive said bottom plates, a key hole opening in each of said bottom plates, vertical bores in said tool holder in alignment with said key hole openings in said bottom plates of said latch members when moved to unlatched positions, coil springs engaging said end walls of said plate members urging said latch member to latch positions, said wrist member having posts disposable into said bores, said posts having annular grooves adjacent their outer ends, and in latched position, said annular grooves are respectively disposed into said key hole openings and secured thereby. 3. The structure of claim 1, wherein said operative means comprises a cylindrical air conduit connection at each side of said bay member, said connections each embody a pneumatic cylinder, a piston in each of said cylinders, outwardly facing plates at outer ends of said pistons, said plates respectively engaging said latch members, pressurized air lines running to said pneumatic cylinders, and said pistons actuated by said pressurized air lines move said latch members to unlatching position. 4. The structure of claim 1, including a pressurized air line to said tool rack, a conduit having an air nozzle carried by said rack, said air line connected to said conduit directing an air stream across said rack. 5. The structure of claim 1, including resilient cushion means disposed between said bay member and the underlying rack segment. 6. The structure of claim 1, including coil springs underlying said bay member supported upon said rack segment cushioning the impact of a robot arm and wrist descending upon for attachment to said tool holder. 7. In connection with a quick change tool system, a tool holding rack, having in combination a plurality of tool holding segments, a bay member mounted onto a tool holding rack segment, a tool holder removably disposed in said bay member, said tool holder having a tool secured thereto, said bay member having a pair of facing spaced apart pneumatic cylinders, said cylinders each having a piston, said pistons having a facing relationship, a pressurized air line having a common source of pressurized air running to said cylinders, said cylinders having facing plate members movable by said pistons, said tool holder having opposed latching members respectively mating with said facing plate members, means urging said latch members into latching position, said air line pressurized causing said pistons to move said latch members into unlatching position, a wrist member having attachment to a robot arm adapted to be disposed to overlie said tool holder for engagement therewith with said latch members in unlatching position, and means depressurizing said air line releasing said latch members to be urged to latch position locking the engagement of said wrist to said tool holder. 8. In connection with an automatic tool changing system, a tool holding rack, having in combination a plurality of tool holding segments, a bay member adapted to be received in a segment, a tool holder adapted to be received in said bay, a tool carried by said tool holder, a wrist member adapted to have attachment to a robot arm, said wrist member adapted to overlie said tool holder, latch members respectively at each side of said tool holder, means urging said latch members into latching position, said bay member carrying a pneumatic cylinder adjacent each of said latch members, a piston in each of said cylinders respectively actuating said latch members, an air line connecting to a pressurized source of air running to said cylinders, means pressurizing said hit line to actuate said pistons to urge said latch members to unlatching positions, said wrist member having means engaging said latch members in unlatching position, said means depressurizing said air line to release said latch members to latching position to lockingly engage said wrist member in attachment to said tool holder, whereby said robot arm lifts said wrist member and the attached tool holder and tool into an operating work position.
