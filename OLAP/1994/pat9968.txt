A robotic manufacturing unit with automatic tool changer, including a stand defining a working space and accommodating a working surface, an output member adapted to controllably move in three-dimensional space supported above the stand, a tool-holding and changing member attached to the output member and adapted to clampingly retain shanks of carriers of tools, a tool tray adapted to accommodate a plurality of tools mounted on tool carriers and, in coordination with the tool holding and changing member, to move from a position of rest, in which the tray is located outside of the working space, to a position of tool pickup and return, in which the tray is substantially located within the working space. The tool-holding and changing member and the shanks fit into one another and have non-circular cross-sections uniquely and reproducibly defining, when the shanks are clampingly retained, the relative angular positions of the tool-holding and changing member and the shanks.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic manufacturing unit with automatic tool changer, comprising: a stand defining a working space and accommodating a rigid, substantially plane working surface; means, supported by said stand above said working surface, and having an output member adapted to controllably move in three-dimensional space; a tool-holding and changing member attached to said output member and adapted to clampingly retain shanks of carriers of tools, said tool-holding and changing member having an internal recess having a V-block-like cross-section produced by two plane surfaces including a defined angle, said tool shanks having two longitudinally extending plane surfaces including an angle substantially identical with said defined angle of said V-block-like cross-section; a tool tray adapted to accommodate a plurality of tools mounted on tool carriers and, in coordination with said tool holding and changing member, to move along guide means from a position of rest, in which said tray is located outside of said working space, to a position of tool pickup and return, in which said tray is substantially located within said working space and above said working surface; whereby upon tool pick-up by said tool-holding and changing member, said member moves down upon and over said tool shank, means being provided to press the two plane surfaces of said tool shank against the two plane surfaces of said V-block-like cross-section, thereby ensuring said unique and reproducible definition of said relative angular positions, and wherein the relative axial positions of said tool-holding and changing member and said shanks are ensured by flange means. 2. A fixturing system for use with a robotic manufacturing unit having a stand defining a working space and accommodating a rigid, substantially plane working surface; means, supported by said stand above said working surface, and having an output member adapted to controllably move in three-dimensional space; a tool-holding and changing member attached to said output member and adapted to clampingly retain shanks of carriers of tools; and a tool tray adapted to accommodate a plurality of tools mounted on tool carriers and, in coordination with said tool holding and changing member, to move along guide means from a position of rest, in which said tray is located outside of said working space, to a position of tool pickup and return, in which said tray is substantially located within said working space and above said working surface; wherein said tool-holding and changing member and said shanks fit into one another and have non-circular cross-sections uniquely and reproducibly defining, when said shanks are clampingly retained, the relative angular positions of said tool-holding and changing member and said shanks; said fixturing system comprising: a body block attachable to said working surface by vacuum suction and incorporating a vacuum chamber to provide a vacuum reservoir for said vacuum suction and a compressed-air chamber for actuating spring-loaded plunger means to provide a clamping force acting on a clamping jaw; first normally closed valve means to retain the vacuum in said vacuum reservoir once attained; second normally closed valve means to release said vacuum for detaching said body block from said working surface; third normally closed valve means for retaining said compressed air in said compressed-air chamber once introduced thereinto for producing said clamping force and for releasing said compressed air for eliminating said clamping force; a handling block having shank means adapted to be held by said tool-holding and changing member; first vacuum connectors to temporarily attach said body block to said handling block by vacuum suction; second vacuum connectors to evacuate said vacuum chamber; a compressed-air connector for supplying said compressed-air chamber; first actuator means to open normally closed second valve means; and second actuator means to open said normally closed third valve means; wherein said body block is located on said fixture tray and can be moved therefrom to be placed onto said working surface by the use, in conjunction with said tool-holding changing member, of said handling block. 3. The manufacturing unit as claimed in claim 1, wherein said means is an XY positioner to the slide of which has been attached an angular-position-controllable motor linked via rack-and-pinion means to said output member and producing in same a translatory movement in the Z-axis direction, and wherein said output member is an arm carrying said tool-holding and changing member. 4. The manufacturing unit as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a fixture tray adapted to accommodate at least one fixture for holding workpieces during the manufacturing process and, in coordination with said tool holding and changing member, to guidedly move from a position of rest, in which said tray is located outside of said working area, to a position of fixture pick-up and return, in which said tray is substantially located within said working area and above said working surface. 5. The manufacturing unit claimed in claim 1, wherein said tool shank is provided on at least one of said plane surfaces with at least one aperture constituting the inlet of a duct leading via said tool shank to said flange means, and said tool-holding and changing member is provided on at least one of said plane surfaces with at least one aperture constituting the outlet of a duct coming from the outside of said tool-holding and changing member, and wherein, in assembly of said tool shank and said tool-holding and changing member, said inlet and outlet apertures are substantially aligned.
