The principal object of the invention is to provide a novel system for assembling green tires according to the two-stage process, together with a programmable control which allows the system to perform most of its functions automatically. The system assembles a first stage tire carcass essentially automatically, then removes and transfers completed carcasses automatically to a unique tire assembly drum, onto which the carcasses are automatically loaded. The assembly drum then acts to form each carcass into the desired toroidal shape. Second stage belt-tread stock assemblies are, in the meantime, completed and then automatically transferred into position surrounding the shaped carcasses, joined thereto, and the joined first and second stage assemblies are stitched together forming a green tire. The completed green tires are then taken automatically from the tire assembly drum and launched onto a unique discharge chute device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In a tire building system a carcass building drum, a carriage supporting said carcass building drum for rotation about its central axis, servo motor means on said carriage and connected to rotate said carcass building drum, means including a way defining a carcass building path and supporting said carriage for movement along the path, a plurality of programmable automatic carcass component servers arranged seriatim along one side of said way, each said server being adapted to deliver a tire carcass component to said drum, programmable carriage motor means for moving said carriage along said way and stopping said carriage successively in predetermined positions precisely aligned with components on said servers and to a carcass unloading position for automated sequential transfer of components from said servers onto said carcass building drum in a predetermined order, bead ring assembly placers supported on said carriage at the ends of said carcass building drum for holding and manipulating bead ring assemblies to be incorporated into a carcass, placer motor means for moving said placers toward the ends of said carcass building drum to set bead ring assemblies onto the ends of components overlapping the ends of said carcass building drum whereby a tire carcass of generally cylindrical shape and having inwardly extending bead areas at its ends is assembled and presented at the unloading position, and a programmable controller connected to control said carriage motor means, said placer motor means and said servers in sequential fashion to automatically construct a first stage tire carcass. 2. A system as defined in claim 1, further including carcass transfer mechanism including programmable drive motors for causing said mechanism to grasp a completed carcass on said carcass building drum at the carcass unloading position, means under control of said programmable controller for withdrawing said carcass building drum from a carcass grasped by said transfer mechanism, said transfer mechanism motors being controlled by said programmable controller to cycle through a transfer sequence in which said transfer mechanism removes a completed carcass away from said carriage. 3. A system as defined in claim 2, including a tire assembly drum located adjacent said transfer mechanism and spaced from the carcass unloading position, said programmable controller actuating said transfer mechanism motors to load the completed carcass onto said tire assembly drum. 4. A system as defined in claim 3, including radially expandable means on said tire assembly drum and operated under control of said programmable controller for engaging the interior of a carcass placed thereon and sealing to the bead areas of the carcass, transforming means operated by said programmable controller for introducing pressurized air into the interior of the sealed carcass and for moving the bead areas of the carcass toward each other to shape the carcass generally into a toroid once the carcass is secured and sealed to said tire assembly drum. 5. The system defined in claim 4, further comprising means for building a belt-tread assembly including a belt-tread building drum supported in alignment with said tire assembly drum, a transfer ring having a plurality of radially movable interior shoes for grasping a belt-tread assembly on said belt-tread building drum, size control servomotor means for moving said shoes of said transfer ring, a track supporting said transfer ring for movement between a pick-up station at said belt-tread building drum and a delivery station at said tire assembly drum, transport motor means for moving said transfer ring along said track between said pick-up and delivery stations, said programmable controller being connected to said size control servomotor means and to said ring transport motor means to cause said transfer ring to remove a belt-tread assembly from said belt-tread building drum and carry said assembly to said delivery station surrounding a carcass on said tire assembly drum. 6. A system as defined in claim 1, wherein said component servers include at least one server assembly for applying ply material from a continuous source of ply material onto said carcass building drum, the continuous source of ply material being in the form of a continuous supply roll, the server assembly comprising: an endless conveyor belt, feeding means for feeding the ply material from the source onto said conveyor belt, knife means for cutting the ply material resting on said conveyor belt, conveyor drive means controlled by said programmable controller for advancing said conveyor belt toward a ply delivery station at which said carcass building drum is aligned with a length of ply material on said conveyor belt, timed operation of said conveyor drive means determining the length of ply material carried past said knife means, applicator means operated by said programmable controller for moving said conveyor belt against said carcass building drum to bring the length of ply material on said belt into contact with said carcass building drum. 7. A tire building system as defined in claim 1, further including power operated stitching means controlled by said programmable controller for stitching the carcass components together on said carcass building drum after all components are assembled thereon. 8. A tire building system as defined in claim 1, further comprising said carriage including a headstock and a tailstock thereon providing support for said carcass building drum and power operated mean controlled by said programmable controller for displacing said tailstock from said carriage to allow said carriage building drum to be held temporarily in cantilever fashion by said headstock, a pair of bead ring assembly placer rings supported by said carriage, one adjacent each end of said drum, and controlled by said programmable controller for receiving a bead ring assembly and cooperating with said carcass building drum to move the bead ring assemblies automatically into coaxial alignment with said drum when said tailstock is displaced from said carriage and then to load the bead ring assembly onto said bead ring assembly placers. 9. A tire carcass building machine as defined in claim 1, further comprising means for folding the edge portions of carcass components overlapping the ends of said carcass building drum, said folding means including a pair of selectively inflatable turn-over bladders rotatably supported one adjacent each end of said drum, means for supplying air under pressure into said bladders under control of said programmable controller during placement of carcass components on said drum to support carcass component edge portions extending beyond the ends of said drum, means for deflating said bladders under control of said programmable controller prior to supplying bead ring assemblies to the opposite ends of said drum, means for deflecting the component edge portions inward toward the deflated bladders under control of said programmable controller as said placer means set bead ring assemblies around the deflected component edge portions, and means for supplying air to re-inflate said bladders and means for guiding the re-inflated bladders over and around the bead ring assemblies, under control of said programmable controller, to enclose such assemblies inside the component edge portions. 10. A tire building system as defined in claim 1, further comprising a stitcher roller approximately equal in length to said carcass building drum, means supporting said stitcher roller on said carriage spaced from said carcass building drum, the axes of said roller and said drum being parallel, and means for moving said stitcher roller into contact with carcass components on said drum under control of said programmable controller while said drum is rotated to smooth the components and stitch them to each other.
