An impasto pattern representing a desired character or mark is formed on a stretchable support, typically sportswear fabric by extruding a high viscosity liquid silicone rubber composition to the support through a nozzle of a robotic applicator having a picture drawing function to form a predetermined pattern of impasto extrudate on the support, and curing the extrudate.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for forming an impasto pattern, comprising the steps of: extruding a high viscosity liquid silicone rubber composition which is a thermosetting or ultraviolet-curable, one part, self-adhesive silicone rubber composition to a support through a nozzle of a robotic applicator having a picture drawing function to form a predetermined pattern of impasto extrudate on the support, and curing the extrudate to form an impasto pattern of silicone rubber representing a desired character or mark wherein said support is stretchable. 2. A method as in claim 1, wherein the stretchable support is comprised of fabric. 3. A method for forming an impasto pattern, comprising the steps of: extruding a high viscosity liquid silicone rubber composition which is a thermosetting or ultraviolet-curable, one part, self-adhesive silicone rubber composition to a support through a nozzle of a robotic applicator having a picture drawing function to form a predetermined pattern of impasto extrudate on the support, and curing the extrudate to form an impasto pattern of silicone rubber representing a desired character or mark wherein the stretchable support is selected from the group consisting of baseball uniforms, sports uniforms, T-shirts, golf wear, swimming suits, wet suits, racing suits, swimming caps and diving masks. 4. A method for forming an impasto pattern, comprising the steps of: extruding a high viscosity liquid silicone rubber composition which is a thermosetting or ultraviolet-curable, one part, self-adhesive silicone rubber composition to a support through a nozzle of a robotic applicator having a picture drawing function to form a predetermined pattern of impasto extrudate on the support, and curing the extrudate to form an impasto pattern of silicone rubber representing a desired character or mark, wherein the stretchable support is selected from the group consisting of baseball uniforms, sports uniforms, T-shirts, golf wear, swimming suits, wet suits, racing suits, swimming caps and diving masks, whereby the impasto pattern is firmly adhered to the stretchable support so as not to be removed from the stretchable support by washing.
