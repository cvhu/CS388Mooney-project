A main controller (55) causes a vision controller (36) to determine the exact location of plies (24) for a composite article in response to images from video cameras (35). The main controller then causes a robot controller (40) to direct a robot (42-46) to pick up the plies and move to a neutral position. The main controller causes the vision controller to determine that the plies were in fact picked up. If so, the main controller causes the robot controller to direct the robot to move the plies to the mold while the vision controller looks for the next ply to be picked up, in overlapped fashion. Failure to properly locate the plies and failure to verify that the plies were picked up causes an automatic retry to locate the plies or verify ply pick up.
Claims I claim: 1. A system for manufacturing composite articles from a plurality of plies, comprising: a source of plies to be laid up; a mold on which the plies are to be laid up in order to form a composite article; a vision subsystem including at least one video camera for providing image signals of an area of said source containing a ply to be laid up into said mold to form the composite article being made, and first signal processing means interconnected with said at least one video camera and responsive to coordinate signals provided thereto indicative of the expected position of the ply to be laid up for initiating a subroutine to process said image signals to provide alignment signals indicative of the actual position of the ply to be laid up; a robot subsystem including a robot movable in a plurality of axes and operable to pickup and release the ply to be laid up in response to command signals provided thereto, and second signal processing means interconnected with said first signal processing means and said robot and responsive to robot go signals provided thereto to order said robot to move to selected positions, and to provide robot waiting signals indicating that said robot has reached one of said selected positions; and third signal processing means interconnected with said first signal processing means and with said second signal processing means for providing a run vision signal to cause said first signal processing means to respond to said coordinate signals and said image signals from said at least one video camera to generate said alignment signals indicative of the actual position of the ply to be laid up and to alternatively provide a success signal indicating that the actual position of the ply to be laid up has been determined and to provide a done signal without providing said success signal if said first signal processing means is unable to determine the actual position of the ply to be laid up; said third signal processing means being further operative in response to said success signal to provide signals causing said robot subsystem to request said alignment signals and to move to the ply to be laid up, to pick up the ply to be laid up and to move the ply to be laid up to said mold and release the ply; said third signal processing means being further operative in response to said done signal in the absence of said success signal to provide said run vision signal and a second try signal to reinitiate said vision subsystem subroutine to determine the actual location of the ply to be laid up; said third signal processing means being further operative in response to said done signal in the absence of said success signal and in the presence of said second try signal to provide signals to cause said vision subsystem to shut down and assume a quiescent state. 2.
