A probe and socket assembly (10) for serving as a mechanical interface. The assembly comprising a socket (11) having a housing (14) adapted for connection to a first supporting structure and a probe (12) which is readily connectable to a second structure and is designed to be easily grappled and manipulated by a robotic device for insertion and coupling with the socket. Cooperable automatic locking means (35, 49) are provided on the probe shaft (43) and socket housing (14) for automatically locking the probe in the socket when the probe is inserted a predetermined distance. A second cooperable locking means (92, 25) on the probe shaft (43) and housing (14) are adapted for actuation after the probe has been inserted the predetermined distance. Actuation means (80, 62) mounted on the probe are responsive to the grip of the probe handle by a gripping device, such as a robot for conditioning the probe for insertion and are also responsive to release of the grip of the probe handle (51) to actuate the second locking means to provide a "hard" lock of the probe in the socket.
