Computer tape cassette storage units store a number or computer tape cassettes during periods of nonuse and are particularly adapted for use in an automated tape cassette archiving and retrieval system. The storage units include at least one shelf unit having a substantially horizontally disposed shelf for supporting a row of computer tape cassettes on edge. Structures are provided so as to minimize (if not eliminate) the possibility that the tape cassettes will become dislodged from the shelf units in the event of mechanical shocks and/or vibrations (e.g., which may occur in an automated system do to a robotic manipulator coming into physical contact with the storage unit). Such structure may take the form of a forward lip against which a portion of the tape cassettes abuts and/or structures which shift the centers of gravity of the tape cassettes rearwardly toward the rear wall of the shelf units upon which they are supported.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A storage unit for storing a number of data storage cassettes and for presenting individual ones of the data storage cassettes at an access position where the cassettes may be grasped and removed from the storage unit, said storage unit comprising: a plurality of storage columns, each column comprising a plurality of vertically stacked shelf units each including generally horizontally disposed cassettes compartments for storing a number of data storage cassettes on edge in a row such that in each column said data storage cassettes are arranged in a vertical storage plane, each of said shelf units including; (i) a horizontal bottom wall supporting each of said data storage cassettes on one side edge, (ii) an open front so as to enable individual ones of said storage cassettes to be grasped and removed from the shelf units, and (iii) a retaining element projecting upwardly from said bottom wall for retaining each cassette on said bottom wall and so substantially preventing said tape cassettes from becoming dislodged from said shelf units by shock, wherein said storage unit further comprises, a frame defining a central axis for mounting said plurality of columns a radial dimension from said central axis so that said plurality of columns are rotatable about said central axis; a motor drive unit operatively coupled to said frame for rotating said columns about said central axis so that a selected one of said columns and individual ones of said data storage cassettes stored therein may be moved into said access position; and an automated master control unit electrically interconnected to said motor drive unit, said master control unit issuing a control signal to said motor drive unit which responsively causes said motor drive unit to effect preselected annular movement of said columns about said central axis so as to thereby controllably move said selected one of said plurality of columns into said access position to thereby present said individual ones of said data storage cassettes in said selected one of said columns at said access position, whereby said individual ones of said data storage cassettes may be grasped and removed from said selected one of said columns. 2. A storage unit for storing a number of data storage cassettes and for presenting individual ones of the data storage cassettes at an access position where the cassettes may be grasped and removed from the storage unit, said storage unit comprising: a plurality of storage columns, each column comprising a plurality of vertically stacked shelf units each including generally horizontally disposed cassette compartments for storing a number of data storage cassettes on edge in a row such that in each column said data storage cassettes are arranged in a vertical storage plane, each of said shelf units including; (i) a horizontal bottom wall supporting each of said data storage cassettes on one side edge, (ii) an open front so as to enable individual ones of said storage cassettes to be grasped and removed from the shelf units, and (iii) a retaining element projecting upwardly from said bottom wall for retaining at least one of said cassettes and so substantially preventing said tape cassettes from becoming dislodged from said shelf unit by shock, wherein said storage unit further comprises, a frame defining a central axis for mounting said plurality of columns a radial dimension from said central axis so that said plurality of columns are rotatable about said central axis; a drive unit which includes a motor having an output coupled operatively to said frame for rotating said frame, and thus said columns, about said central axis so that a selected one of said columns and individual ones of said data storage cassettes stored therein may be moved into said access position; and a master control unit electrically interconnected with said drive unit, said master control unit issuing a command signal to said drive unit for effecting preselected angular movement of said columns about said central axis to thereby controllably move said selected one of said plurality of columns into said access position to thereby present said individual ones of said data storage cassettes in said selected one of said columns at said access position, whereby said individual ones of said data storage cassettes may be grasped and removed from said selected one of said columns. 3. A storage unit for storing a number of data storage cassettes and for presenting individual ones of the data storage cassettes at an access position where the cassettes may be grasped and removed from the storage unit, said storage unit comprising: a plurality of storage columns, each column comprising a plurality of vertically stacked shelf units each including generally horizontally disposed cassette compartments for storing a number of data storage cassettes on edge in a row such that in each column said data storage cassettes are arranged in a vertical storage plane, each of said shelf units including; (i) a horizontal bottom wall supporting each of said data storage cassettes on one side edge, (ii) an open front so as to enable individual ones of said storage cassettes to be grasped and removed from the shelf units, and (iii) a retaining element projecting upwardly from said bottom wall for retaining at least one of said cassettes by interacting with a lower position of each cassette arranged on said bottom wall and so substantially preventing said tape cassettes from becoming dislodged from said shelf units by shock, wherein said storage unit further comprises, a frame defining a central axis for mounting said plurality of columns a radial dimension from said central axis so that said plurality of columns are rotatable about said central axis; a motor drive unit operatively coupled to said frame for rotating said columns about said central axis so that a selected one of said columns and individual ones of said data storage cassettes stored therein may be moved into said access position; and an automated master control unit electrically interconnected to said motor drive unit, said master control unit issuing a control signal to said motor drive unit which responsively causes said motor drive unit to effect preselected angular movement of said columns about said central axis so as to thereby controllably move said selected one of said plurality of columns into said access position to thereby present said individual ones of said data storage cassettes in said selected one of said columns at said access position, whereby said individual ones of said data storage cassette may be grasped and removed from said selected one of said columns. 4. A storage unit for storing a number of data storage cassettes and for presenting individual ones of the data storage cassettes at an access position where the cassettes may be grasped and removed from the storage unit, said storage unit comprising: a plurality of storage columns, each column comprising a plurality of vertically stacked shelf units each including generally horizontally disposed cassette compartments for storing a number of data storage cassettes on edge in a row such that in each column said data storage cassettes are arranged in a vertical storage plane, each of said shelf units including; (i) a horizontal bottom wall supporting each of said data storage cassettes on one side edge, (ii) an open front so as to enable individual ones of said storage cassettes to be grasped and removed from the shelf units, and (iii) a retainer projecting upwardly from said bottom wall for retaining said cassettes and so substantially preventing said tape cassettes from becoming dislodged from said shelf units by shock, wherein said storage unit further comprises, a frame defining a central axis for mounting said plurality of columns a radial dimension from said central axis so that said plurality of columns are rotatable about said central axis; a drive unit which includes a motor having an output coupled operatively to said frame for rotating said frame, and thus said columns, about said central axis so that a selected one of said columns and individual ones of said data storage cassettes stored therein may be moved into said access position; and a master control unit electrically interconnected with said drive unit, said master control unit issuing a command signal to said drive unit for effecting preselected angular movement of said columns about said central axis to thereby controllably move said selected one of said plurality of columns into said access position to thereby present said individual ones of said data storage cassettes in said selected one of said columns at said access position, whereby said individual ones of said data storage cassettes may be grasped and removed from said selected one of said columns.
