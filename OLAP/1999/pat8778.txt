A system for maintaining a substantially fixed distance between a localized surface of the heart and the distal end of a surgical device for use in endoscopic surgical procedures. The system comprises a stabilizer for minimizing localized motion of the heart in attached communication with a sensor for sensing localized motion of the heart in a region proximal the stabilizer and a controller in electrical communication with the sensor for processing data indicative of the localized motion of the heart in a region proximal the stabilizer. The processor is in electrical communication with a controller for a robotic arm that holds an instrument for use in an endoscopic surgical procedure, said instrument having a proximal and distal end, and said robotic arm in electrical communication with the controller. The robotic arm repositions the instrument in response to signals received from said controller to maintain a substantially same relative configuration between the localized surface of the heart and the distal end of the instrument.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for maintaining a substantially fixed distance between a localized surface of the heart and a surgical device having a distal end for use in endoscopic surgical procedures, the system comprising: a stabilizer for minimizing localized motion of the heart; a sensor for sensing localized motion of the heart in a region proximal the stabilizer; a controller in electrical communication with the sensor for processing data indicative of the localized motion of the heart in a region proximal the stabilizer; a robotic arm for holding an instrument for use in an endoscopic surgical procedure, said instrument having a proximal and distal end, said robotic arm in electrical communication with the controller; and wherein said robotic arm repositions the instrument in response to signals received from said controller to maintain a substantially fixed distance between the localized surface of the heart and the distal end of the instrument.
