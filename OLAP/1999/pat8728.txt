A sleeve for providing referencing between an autochanger storage rack and a data cartridge caddy before, during and after installation of the data cartridge caddy into the autochanger storage rack. The sleeve provides accurate alignment and referencing in the X, Y and Z directions so that it is relatively easy for a user to install the data cartridge caddy into the autochanger storage rack. The sleeve also maintains the data cartridge caddy in a predetermined referenced position so that the data cartridge handling system of the autochanger is able to assume that the data cartridge caddy and all of the data cartridges in the data cartridge caddy are in predetermined locations.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A data cartridge caddy-to-storage rack referencing system that permits a user to install a data cartridge into a storage rack and provides accurate alignment of data cartridges within that data cartridge caddy to an autochanger once the data cartridge caddy is installed in the storage rack of the autochanger, said data cartridge caddy-to-storage rack referencing system comprising: a caddy guide bottom plate for providing preliminary Z direction referencing between said data cartridge caddy and said storage rack prior to installing said caddy into said storage rack; a caddy guide rail for providing preliminary and intermediate Y direction referencing between said data cartridge caddy and said storage rack prior to and during installation of said data cartridge caddy into said storage rack; at least one cartridge guide tab for providing intermediate Z direction referencing between said data cartridge caddy and said storage rack during installation of said data cartridge caddy into said storage rack; Z referencing tabs that correspond with Z referencing slots for providing final Z direction referencing between said data cartridge caddy and said storage rack and between said data cartridge caddy and said autochanger once said data cartridge caddy is installed in said storage rack; at least one Y referencing fin that engages at least one Y referencing slot for providing final Y direction referencing between said data cartridge caddy and said storage rack and between said data cartridge caddy and said autochanger once said storage cartridge caddy is installed in said storage rack; and at least one X referencing pad that engages at least one X referencing surface for providing final X direction referencing between said data cartridge caddy and said storage rack and between said data cartridge caddy and said autochanger once said data cartridge caddy is installed in said storage rack. 2. The data cartridge caddy-to-storage rack referencing system according to claim 1, wherein said final Z direction referencing also includes at least one caddy hook the engages at one ledge, providing additional final Z direction referencing. 3. The data cartridge caddy-to-storage rack referencing system according to claim 2, wherein said final Y direction referencing also includes at least one vertical tab with said at least one caddy hook that engages a slot, providing additional final Y direction referencing. 4.
