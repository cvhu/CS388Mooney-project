An automated order picking system assembled from known, available components and that includes a manager computer to receive orders for goods from a customer and to break the order down into requested full pallets of multiple ordered layers of goods; layers of goods ordered by the customer; compatible ordered layers of goods that can be combined into full pallets; and compatible cases of ordered goods that can be formed into layers and into full pallets of multiple layers of goods; and vertical cells for receiving, storing and delivering cases of the goods. The vertical cells comprise towers having mutually facing tower sections that receive goods delivered to feed conveyors by gantry robots having end effectors capable of handling the goods and the tower sections passing the goods back and forth as the goods are moved downwardly for placement on the discharge conveyor under the control of a programmable logic computer. The full pallets, full layers and cases of goods are conveyed to a palletizer to be organized into the requested orders.
Claims We claim: 1. An automated material handling system comprising a conveyor system; a case handling system which handles cases of goods, said case handling system being disposed on said conveyor system and delivering said cases of goods to said conveyor system, and said case handling system including a case storage area which has said cases of goods stored therein; a full layer handling system which handles full layers of cases of goods, said full layer handling system being disposed on said conveyor system and delivering said full layers of cases to said conveyor system, and said full layer handling system including a full layer storage area which has said full layers of cases of goods stored therein; a control system, said control system being coupled to said case handling system and controlling the delivery of said cases of goods from said case handling system to said conveyor system, and said control system being also coupled to said full layer handling system and controlling the delivery of said full layers of cases of goods from said full layer handling system to said conveyor system; and a palletizer, said palletizer being disposed on said conveyor system and receiving said cases of goods and said full layers of cases of goods from said conveyor system, and said palletizer placing said cases of goods and said full layers of cases of goods on receiving pallets in selected patterns. 2. An automated material handling system according to claim 1, wherein said conveyor system comprises a feed conveyor and a discharge conveyor; and wherein said case handling system comprises a plurality of vertically extending towers commonly disposed on said feed conveyor and said discharge conveyor, said plurality of towers including a first tower which receives a first subset of said cases of goods from said feed conveyor and which delivers said first subset of said cases of goods to said discharge conveyor, and a second tower which receives a second subset of said cases of goods from said feed conveyor and which delivers said second subset of said cases of goods to said discharge conveyor. 3. An automated material handling system according to claim 1, wherein goods contained in said first subset of said cases of goods are different than goods contained in said second subset of said cases of goods, such that said first and second towers are dedicated to goods of a different nature.
