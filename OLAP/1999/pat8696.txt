An apparatus and method are described for stripping the photoresist from a wafer while in a substantially parallel manner, another wafer is being transferred between a load lock chamber and a transfer chamber, where the processing occurs. Further, a system is described whereby two load lock chambers are employed so that processing of wafers can continue uninterrupted by a delay caused by the need to open, empty, reload and re-equilibrate a single load lock chamber. Still further, a system is described for performing multi-step dry-stripping applications requiring different conditions for two or more of the steps wherein the steps may be performed simultaneously or sequentially. Finally, a system combining a dry-stripping module and a wet-cleaning module is described which combination system permits the continuous, fully-automated dry-stripping and wet-cleaning of wafers and, upon completion of the entire processing cycle, returning wafers to their original wafer cassettes.
