A method for temporarily connecting a body half and a door half of a hinge, said body half of said hinge including connecting means for receiving said door half of said hinge including connecting means for receiving the body half, one of said connecting means including a portion having disposed proximate the end thereof at least one groove for receiving a resilient flexible retainer; said method including the steps of; (a) fastening the hinge when assembled to a vehicle and a door so as to fasten the door with the vehicle temporarily; (b) painting the vehicle and door together while temporarily connected; (c) subjecting the vehicle and door and the resilient flexible retainer to heat such as that found in a curing process for a painting process for vehicles; (d) separating said body and door halves of said hinge by removing the retainer and separating said halves; (e) separating said door from said vehicle by separating the body half and the door half of said hinges.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are as follows: 1. A method for processing a vehicle body and a door attached thereto, comprising the steps of: providing a vehicle body having a body hinge portion defining at least one opening; providing a door having a door hinge portion defining at least one opening; providing a hinge pin having a head at one end thereof and at least two circumferential grooves near a second end thereof; providing a resilient flexible nylon ring; aligning said at least one opening of said body hinge portion with said at least one opening of said door hinge portion; then passing said hinge pin through said at least one opening of said body hinge portion and said at least one opening of said door hinge portion, such that said openings are located axially between said head and said at least two circumferential grooves; placing said resilient flexible nylon ring in the one of said at least two circumferential grooves that is nearest said second end, thereby hingedly connecting said door to said vehicle body; then coating said vehicle body and said door with paint while said door and vehicle body remain hingedly connected; then heating said vehicle body, door and resilient flexible nylon ring, thereby curing said paint and rendering said nylon ring brittle; then shattering said brittle nylon ring and removing said hinge pin from said at least one opening of said body hinge portion and said at least one opening of said door hinge portion, thereby disconnecting said door from said vehicle body; and then moving said door relative to said vehicle body, thereby separating said door from said vehicle body. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising performing the following steps after said moving step: (f) mounting necessary hardware in the vehicle body and in the door while the door is separated from the vehicle body; and (g) hingedly connecting said door with said vehicle body by re-aligning the openings of said hinge portions and inserting said hinge pin into said hinge openings and securing a metal ring clip in said groove nearest said second end of said hinge pin.
