An automated data storage library for storing and accessing a plurality of data storage media stored in a plurality of storage slots. A plurality of accessors access the data storage media between the storage slots and data recording device(s), an operator interface allows an operator to designate one of the accessors as active, and a library manager is interconnected with the accessors and with the operator interface to set operation modes of the accessors. The library manager sets the operation mode of one of the accessors to the active mode (A) in an initial decision, first (1), based on the relative conditions of the accessors, the conditions having three levels (a) fully available, (b) degraded, and (c) not available, and, if all the accessors are in the same level of condition, second (2), an arbitrarily selected one of the accessors, and (B) in an override decision, based on the active accessor if designated at the operator interface, or, if not designated, on the one of the accessors last in the active mode.
