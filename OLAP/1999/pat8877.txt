A method of precisely aligning and positioning a first portion of a first element with respect to a corresponding portion of a second element comprises the following steps: a) providing the first portion with a regular polygonal recess having N faces, a first circle with a given diameter being inscribed by said N faces of said polygonal recess; b) providing the corresponding portion of the second element with N freely rotating cylindrical rollers, said rollers being positioned in such a way as to be equally angularly spaced and inscribed in a second circle whose diameter is substantially equal to the diameter of the first circle; c) moving one of the elements with respect to the other in such a way as to introduce the N cylindrical rollers into said polygonal recess wherein each of the rollers substantially faces a corresponding vertex of the polygonal recess; and d) rotating one of said portions with respect to the other portion of said elements through an angle substantially equal to 180/N.degree. once the N cylindrical rollers are in the polygonal recess in order to precisely align the two elements with respect to each other.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for precisely aligning and positioning a first portion of a first element with respect to a corresponding portion of a second element comprising the following steps: a) providing the first portion with a regular polygonal recess having N faces, a first circle with a given diameter being inscribed by said N faces of said polygonal recess; b) providing the corresponding portion of the second element with N freely rotating cylindrical rollers, said rollers being positioned in such a way as to be equally angularly spaced and inscribed in a second circle whose diameter is substantially equal to the diameter of the first circle; c) moving one of the elements laterally with respect to the other in such a way as to introduce the N cylindrical rollers into said polygonal recess wherein each of the rollers substantially faces a corresponding vertex of the polygonal recess; and d) rotating one of said portions with respect to the other portion of said elements only through an angle substantially equal to 180/N.degree. once the N cylindrical rollers are in the polygonal recess in order to precisely align the two elements with respect to each other. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein said recess is substantially triangular in shape, and wherein the step of rotating comprises rotating said one portion through an angle of rotation substantially equal to 60.degree..
