A two-axis Cartesian robot comprising a vertically disposed Y-axis support having a traverse carriage selectively vertically movably mounted thereon. An X-axis support is movably mounted on the carriage. A reversible drive motor is mounted on the carriage and has a driven shaft extending therefrom upon which is mounted a planetary gear drive including an X-axis drive gear and a Y-axis drive gear which are in engagement with gear racks on the X-axis and Y-axis supports, respectively. A Y-axis brake is provided for selective engagement with the Y-axis drive gear for selectively preventing rotation of the Y-axis drive gear and an X-axis brake is provided for selective engagement with the X-axis drive gear for selectively preventing rotation of the X-axis drive gear. A workpiece manipulator is secured to the X-axis support for movement therewith.
