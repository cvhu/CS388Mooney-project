A method and apparatus for path planning and execution of movements of multiple mobile objects, such as robotic manipulators (64, 66), in a common workspace. Path planning at a relatively coarse scale yields, for each object, path definitions (24) in configuration space (c-space), which is an n-dimensional space, where there are n degrees of freedom of movement of each object. The coarse path definitions are interpolated to provide primary control signals (54) to execute object movements, in combination with collision avoidance control signals (56) derived from an artificial force field model (46) that generates repulsion forces based on mutual proximity of the objects. Path planning includes determining which subregions or cells of c-space are subject to potential collision, and selecting multiple trial path segments until a path is found around those cells. For execution, the coarse scale path parameters, are expanded to a finer scale by interpolation (40), and the artificial force field model generates additional control signals (56) corresponding to the repulsion forces needed to maintain separation of the objects in the workspace.
