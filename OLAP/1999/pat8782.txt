Disclosed is an automated data storage library in which a library accessor, arranged for accessing data recording media stored in storage bins, may also exchange electronic components of the library. The media are provided with access engagement surfaces for engagement by the library accessor(s). A plurality of removable mounts, having access engagement surfaces matching the data recording media access engagement surfaces, are provided for individually mounting electronic components, such as data storage drives and communication jumpers. Component slots are provided in the library for individually supporting the removable mounts, and mating low insertion force connectors are provided respectively on the removable mounts and ones of the component slots for removably connecting the electronic components to the library. Thus, a library accessor may engage selected removable mounts to change communication jumper locations and may change the data storage drives between library controllers, and replace a failed RAID data storage drive with a spare drive. Actuators may be operated by a library accessor to release and engage the low insertion force connectors to effectively provide zero insertion force connections.
