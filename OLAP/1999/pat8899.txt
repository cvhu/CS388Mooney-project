To provide a compact parts feeding apparatus capable of reducing the parts stock in the line, and facilitate the exchange between different kinds of devices, a first transfer unit 200A of a transferring and positioning arrangement 200C of a parts feeding apparatus 200, transfers a tray T carrying parts PB upward in a first direction Z1 from a conveyor arrangement 14. A positioning unit 200D positions the tray T carrying the parts PB in a determined position within the assembly range of an assembling body 10 of the first transfer unit 200A. A second transfer unit 200B descends in a second direction Z2 opposite to the first direction, to transfer the positioned tray T to the first transfer unit 200a or to discharge the tray T after it has been emptied of parts onto the conveyor arrangement 14.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A parts feeding apparatus for feeding parts, which are carried on a tray, to an assembling body for assembly, comprising: conveyor means for conveying said parts carrying tray to and from said assembling body; and transferring and positioning means for transferring and positioning said parts carrying tray; wherein said transferring and positioning means includes: a first transfer unit for transferring said parts carrying tray upward in a first direction from said conveyor means; a positioning unit for positioning said parts carrying tray from said first transfer unit into a determined position within an assembling range of said assembling body; and a second transfer unit for transferring said parts carrying tray positioned in said determined position, downward in a second direction reversed from said first direction, to said first transfer unit or for discharging said tray emptied of said parts to said conveyor means; wherein said conveyor means includes: an introducing conveyor arranged for feeding said first transfer unit with said parts carrying tray; and a discharging conveyor for discharging said tray emptied of said parts from said second transfer unit; and wherein said introducing conveyor and said discharging conveyor are arranged one over the other, and wherein the direction for said introducing conveyor to introduce said tray and the direction for said discharging conveyor to discharge said tray are made to intersect the moving directions of said tray including said first direction and said second direction in said transferring and positioning means.
