A wafer transfer system is described for transferring a wafer while at substantially the same time another wafer is being processed. The wafer transfer system comprises, in one embodiment, a transfer chamber having a wafer transfer blade, a load lock chamber coupled to the transfer chamber, an atmospheric robot for loading and unloading the wafer into the load lock chamber, and a slider coupled to the wafer transfer blade for moving the wafer transfer blade between the transfer chamber and the load lock chamber. According to a preferred embodiment, the slider utilizes a magnetic coupling mechanism. In a further embodiment, a device comprising a transfer chamber coupled to a plurality of plasma sources capable of simultaneously or sequentially providing different plasma structures within the transfer chamber, is described.
Claims What is claimed: 1. A device for processing a plurality of wafers comprising: a transfer chamber within which processing of said plurality of wafers takes place; a load lock chamber coupled to said transfer chamber; a plurality of independent temperature controlled stages located within and coupled to said transfer chamber, said stages being disposed at a predetermined radius from a hub concentrically located within and operatively coupled to said transfer chamber, each of said plurality of stages being capable of supporting one of said plurality of wafers during processing; a transfer blade located within and operationally coupled to said transfer chamber, said transfer blade having a retracted and an extended position; in said retracted position said transfer blade is located at said predetermined radius, in said extended position said transfer blade is in said load lock chamber, said transfer blade being capable of transferring said plurality of wafers one at a time from said load lock chamber to said transfer chamber or from said transfer chamber to said load lock chamber while others of said plurality of wafers are being processed on said plurality of stages within said transfer chamber; a plurality of fins having a first end and a second end said first end, of each of said fins being coupled to said hub, said second end of each of said fins being located at said predetermined radius and communicating with one of said plurality of stages, said plurality of fins being capable of transferring one of said plurality of wafers from said transfer blade or one of said plurality stages to another of said plurality of stages or back to said transfer blade; a robot coupled to said load lock chamber, said robot having a plurality of platens, each of which said plurality of platens being capable of supporting one of said plurality of wafers and transferring said wafer to and from said load lock chamber; a wafer holder having a plurality of shelves, said wafer holder being located within said load lock chamber, each of said plurality of shelves being capable of communicating with said robot; a plurality of plasma sources coupled to said transfer chamber, each of said plasma sources being located above one of said plurality of stages; and, a plurality of gas inlet tubes, each of said gas inlet tubes being connected to one of said plurality of plasma sources, the remote end of each of said plurality of gas inlet tubes being connected to one of a plurality of gas sources, each of said gas sources being capable of providing a different gas to said plasma source. 2. The device of claim 1 wherein, said plurality of shelves comprises 50 shelves for holding wafers to be processed or wafers which have been processed and 6 shelves for holding dummy wafers.
