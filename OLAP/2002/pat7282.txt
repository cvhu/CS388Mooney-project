A process for insert molding at least a portion of a flexible webbing material within at least a portion of a plastic injection molded part produces a product having a plastic injection molded part with a contour formed by a front surface and a rear surface, and a flexible webbing material having at least a portion embedded within the injection molded plastic part, while a remaining portion of the flexible webbing material extends externally with respect to the injection molded plastic part. An injection molding die is provided for insert molding the portion of the flexible webbing material within at least a portion of the plastic injection molded part. The die defines a chamber for receiving molten plastic during an injection molding step. The chamber is defined by the die having a surface for forming the contour of a front surface of at least one part to be injection molded, and another portion of the chamber having a surface for forming the contour of a rear surface of the at least one part to be injection molded. The chamber is formed by at least two separable portions of the die moveable away from one another along a parting line. A seal is provided along at least a portion of the parting line of the chamber where a flexible webbing material extends internally within the chamber. The seal is a high temperature resistant material selected to have sufficient flexibility to prevent damage to the flexible webbing material during the sealing step.
Claims What is claimed is: 1.

The process of claim 1 further comprising the step of: forming a unitary body from the plastic injection molded part and flexible webbing material to define a vehicle pocket for attachment to an interior of a motor vehicle. 6. The process of claim 1 further comprising the step of: providing the flexible webbing material with at least a portion of inelastic webbing material and a portion of elastic webbing material. 7. The process of claim 1 further comprising the step of: providing the flexible webbing material with at least a portion of woven, cylindrical, rope material. 8. The process of claim 1 further comprising the step of: providing the flexible webbing material with at least a portion of flat, planar, woven, material with a rectangular cross-section. 9. The process of claim 1 further comprising the step of: selecting the high temperature resistant material with sufficient flexibility to prevent damage to the flexible webbing material from a group consisting of silicon B, high temperature epoxy, and high temperature urethane. 10. A product manufactured by the process of claim 1 comprising: a plastic injection molded part having a contour formed by a front surface and a rear surface; and a flexible webbing material having at least a portion to be embedded within the injection molded plastic part, while at least a portion of the flexible webbing material extends externally with respect to the injection molded plastic part. 11. The product of claim 10 further comprising: the flexible webbing material extending externally of the plastic injection molded part along an interface between the front surface and the rear surface of the plastic injection molded part. 12. The product of claim 10 further comprising: the plastic injection molded portion defining a frame having at least one frame member with first and second portions spaced from one another, and the flexible webbing material connected to and extending between the first and second portions of at least one frame member providing a flexible webbed surface extending therebetween. 13. The product of claim 10 further comprising: the plastic injection molded portion defining a frame member mountable on a support surface, the frame member having first and second portions spaced from one another, and a third portion extending between and connecting the first and second portions with respect to one another in a single, unitary, integral piece, and the flexible webbing material insert molded within the third portion along an entire longitudinal length and along at least a portion of a longitudinal length of the first and second portions of the frame member to define part of an openable flexible web pocket between the first, second, and third portions of the frame member when the frame member is mounted with respect to the support surface. 14. The product of claim 10 further comprising: a unitary body formed from the plastic injection molded part and flexible webbing material to define part of a pocket for attachment to an interior of a motor vehicle. 15. The product of claim 10 further comprising: the flexible webbing material having at least a portion of inelastic webbing material and a portion of elastic webbing material. 16.
