Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of BTAK. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding BTAK. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of BTAK expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of BTAK are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A compound up to 50 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 45, or 46 wherein said compound specifically hybridizes with a nucleic acid encoding BTAK and inhibits the expression of BTAK. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1, which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3, wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5, wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7, wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2, wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of BTAK in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1, so that expression of BTAK is inhibited. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11, further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11, wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
