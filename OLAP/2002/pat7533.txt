The invention provides a method of performing x-ray crystallography on samples by using a robot to select the target sample, to position the sample for x-ray crystallography, and to deposit the sample, all without transferring the sample to another device, such as a goniometer. This method allows high throughput, automated crystallography, thereby providing a high volume of samples to be tested while lessening the need for human intervention.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of performing crystallography, comprising using a robot to select a sample, using said robot to selectively position the sample, maintaining the sample in an artificial environment, and performing x-ray crystallography on the sample without decoupling the sample from said robot. 2. The method of claim 1, additionally comprising the step of using said robot to selectively release the sample after crystallography is completed. 3. The method of claim 1, additionally comprising the steps of providing an environmental container for storing the sample in an artificial environment, and selectively removing the sample from said environmental container before said step of performing x-ray crystallography. 4. The method of claim 3, additionally comprising the step of selectively replacing the sample into said environmental container after said step of performing x-ray crystallography. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein said step of maintaining the sample in an artificial environment comprises the steps of selectively directing a stream of gas over the sample, and controlling the temperature of said stream of gas to regulate the temperature of the sample. 6. The method of claim 2, additionally comprising the step of using said robot to selectively re-position the sample prior to the step of selectively releasing the sample.
