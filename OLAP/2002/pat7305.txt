A system for identifying and managing information stored in a plurality of physical volumes (e.g., tape cartridges) in an information storage system includes a plurality of labels. Each label is configured for physical attachment to a physical volume and includes an electromagnetic transducer for storing data associated with the physical volume and/or the information contained therein. The means for storing is non-volatile, re-writable, and readable without requiring physical contact with the label.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for identifying and managing information stored in a plurality of physical volumes in an information storage system, wherein said physical volumes are contained in an automated physical volume storage system comprising a plurality of physical volume storage locations and a transfer means for moving physical storage volumes from storage locations to use locations, and wherein said transceiver means is coupled to said transfer means, said system comprising: a plurality of labels, each label associated with a corresponding one of the plurality of physical volumes, each label including a passive electromagnetic transponder having a re-writable non-volatile memory configured to store data associated with the information stored in the corresponding physical volume; an active electromagnetic transceiver means for electromagnetically reading and modifying said data from a selected label without requiring physical contact with said selected label; and a second transceiver means for reading said data from said selected label and for modifying said data in said selected label without requiring physical contact with said selected label, wherein at least one of said uses location comprises a physical volume drive, and wherein said second transceiver means is coupled to said physical volume drive to enable modification of said data in said selected label in conjunction with modification of said information stored in the physical volume to which said selected label is attached. 2. A system for identifying and managing information stored in a plurality of physical volumes in an information storage system, comprising: a plurality of labels, each label associated with a corresponding one of the plurality of physical volumes, each label including an electromagnetic transponder having a non-volatile memory configured to store data associated with the information stored in the corresponding physical volume; a transceiver for electrormagnetically reading said data from a selected label without requiring physical contact with said selected label; and means, coupled to said transceiver for determining the relative positioning of said transceiver and said selected label based on attributes of a signal received by said transceiver from said transponder. 3. The system of claim 2, wherein said electromagnetic transponder is a passive transponder. 4. The system of claim 3, wherein said transceiver means comprises an active electromagnetic transceiver, said transceiver reading said passive transponder with an incident electromagnetic signal, wherein said passive transducer returns said data signal in response to said incident electromagnetic signal. 5. The system of claim 4, wherein said non-volatile memory is re-writable. 6. The system of claim 5, wherein said transceiver means further comprises write means for modifying said data in said selected label without requiring physical contact with said selected label. 7. The system of claim 6, wherein said physical volumes are contained in an automated physical volume storage system comprising a plurality of physical volume storage locations and a transfer means for moving physical storage volumes from storage locations to use locations, and wherein said transceiver means is coupled to said transfer means. 8. A system for identifying and managing information stored in a plurality of physical volumes in an information storage system, wherein said physical volumes are contained in an automated physical volume storage system comprising a plurality of physical volume storage locations and a transfer means of moving physical storage volumes from storage locations to use locations, and wherein said transceiver means is coupled to said transfer means, said system comprising: a plurality of labels, each label associated with a corresponding one of the plurality of physical volumes, each label including a passive electromagnetic transponder having a re-writable non-volatile memory configured to store data associated with the information stored in the corresponding physical volume; an active electromagnetic transceiver for electromagnetically reading and modifying said data from a selected label without requiring physical contact with said selected label, said transceiver reading said transponder with an incident electromagnetic signal, wherein said transponder returns said data signal in response to said incident electromagnetic signal; means, coupled to said transceiver, for determining the relative positioning of said transceiver and said selected label based on attributes of a signal received by said transceiver from said transponder; and a second transceiver means for reading said data from said selected label and for modifying said data in said selected label without requiring physical contact with said selected label, wherein at least one of said use locations comprises a physical volume drive and wherein said second transceiver means is coupled to said physical volume drive to enable modification of said data in said selected label in conjunction with modification of said information stored in the physical volume to which said selected label is attached.
