The invention relates to methods of preparing plasmid pools by growing colonies in discrete wells of a semi-solid or gelatinous medium. This method may facilitate colony collection, reduce colony overgrowth, reduce contamination by adventitious microorganisms, and increase the efficiency of plasmid screening techniques.
Claims I claim: 1. A method for culturing a plasmid library, comprising combining a plasmid library comprising a plurality of microorganisms, each expressing one of a plurality of plasmids, with a culture medium comprising a gelling agent, dividing the culture medium between at least ten receptacles, incubating the receptacles, and separating the microorganisms from the culture medium. 2. The method of claim 1, further comprising isolating DNA from the microorganisms. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the culture medium comprises a selection agent. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the gelling agent is selected from agar or agarose. 5. A method for culturing a plasmid library, comprising combining a plasmid library comprising a plurality of microorganisms, each expressing one of a plurality of plasmids, with a culture medium, adding a gelling agent to the culture medium, dividing the culture medium between at least ten receptacles, incubating the receptacles, and separating the microorganisms from the culture medium. 6. The method of claim 5, further comprising isolating DNA from the microorganisms. 7. The method of claim 5, wherein the culture medium comprises a selection agent. 8. The method of claim 5, wherein the gelling agent is selected from agar or agarose.
