This invention relates to the discovery of the association of certain nucleic acid sequences and proteins with breast cancer, the use of such sequences as a diagnostic indicator and treatments based on the association.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for the detection of breast cancer in a cell population comprising breast cells suspected of being cancerous, the method comprising analyzing at least one breast cell to determine if the breast cell overexpresses a protein that specifically binds to polyclonal antibodies raised against a protein encoded by SEQ ID NO:5, wherein overexpression of the protein in said breast cell as compared to normal breast cells is an indicator of breast cancer. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the cell is analyzed by quantitation of the protein. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the breast cell is a human cell. 4. A method for detecting the presence of breast cancer in human tissue said method comprising: (i) isolating a biological sample comprising breast cells from a human being tested for breast cancer, (ii) contacting the biological sample with an antibody which selectively binds to a protein encoded by SEQ ID NO:5; and (iii) detecting the existence of overexpression of a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a protein that specifically binds to polyclonal antibodies raised against a protein encoded by SEQ ID NO:5 wherein overexpression of the protein in said breast cells as compared to normal breast cells is an indicator of breast cancer. 5. The method of claim 4, wherein the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. 6. The method of claim 4, wherein the antibody is a polyclonal antibody. 7. The method of claim 2, wherein quantitation of the protein is by immunoassay.
