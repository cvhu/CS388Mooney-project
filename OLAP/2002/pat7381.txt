A method of operating a target system wherein small changes in input variables produce small changes in output variables in a manner permits system learning on a time dependent basis. The rate of change of the system output is directly dependent upon the product of the rate of change of the system input and a matrix consisting of input variables and antecedent and consequent parameters. A preferred performance criterion is obtained through the approximation of the said matrix to a weighted-augmented pseudo-inverse Jacobian. Off-line, the system undergoes a series of iterations using a wide range of input variables wherein the actual outputs are compared to the desired outputs and optimized values for the antecedent and consequent parameters are obtained and passed back to the said matrix for use in the subsequent iteration.
