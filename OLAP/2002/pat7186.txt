A method and apparatus for controlling the steering of a trailing section of a multi-sectioned vehicle is described. The trailing section follows the path of the first section. Data is acquired by a controller from sensors on the various sections. The controller then processes this data, generating a configuration needed for the controller-steered wheels to follow a path approximately equivalent to the path taken by the first steered section. Power is then applied by some means to steer these controller-steered wheels, forcing them into the desired configuration. The complexity of the control system can be varied with different algorithms providing alternative steering patterns as desired. This system can be extended with more trailing sections without necessitating more than minor changes to the control algorithms.
