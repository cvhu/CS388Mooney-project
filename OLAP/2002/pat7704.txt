A workpiece positioner including a pair of generally vertical laterally displaced and opposing workpiece holder supports and a pair of workpiece holders. Each the pair of workpiece holders includes a first and second workpiece holder which are operably associated with one of the workpiece holder supports such that the opposing first workpiece holders are generally coaxially aligned and the second workpiece holders are generally coaxially aligned and the workpiece holders rotate about a first generally horizontal common axis with respect to the vertical workpiece holder supports, the first workpiece holders and the second workpiece holders, respectively, are disposed at least partially on an opposite side of a plane which runs generally perpendicular to the vertical workpiece holder support and through the horizontal common axis.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A workpiece positioner, which includes: a pair of generally vertical disposed laterally displaced and opposing workpiece holder supports; and a pair of workpiece holders operably connected to said workpiece holder supports, said pair of workpiece holders including a first set of workpiece holders and a second set of workpiece holders, wherein each said set of workpiece holders includes a first workpiece holder and second workpiece holder which are operably associated with one of said workpiece holder supports such that sad first workspace holder are opposing and generally coaxially aligned with said respective second workpiece holders and said workpiece holders rotate about a first generally horizontal common as with respect to said vertical workpiece holder supports, further said first set of workpiece holders are rotatably driven about a second common axis and said second set of workpiece holders are rotatably driven about a third common axis which when said first and said second set of workpiece holders are in an operating position are disposed at least partially on an opposite side of a plane which runs generally perpendicular to said vertical workpiece holder support and through said horizontal common axis. 2. The workpiece positioner of claim 1, wherein said workpiece holders are interconnected by a support tying member which is configured to provide a minimal clearance region between two workpieces operably disposed on and between said workpiece holders, wherein said support tying member runs through said first generally horizontal axis has a first portion forming an acute angle with respect to said horizontal plane and a second portion forming an obtuse angle with respect to said horizontal plane. 3. The workpiece positioner of claim 2, wherein said support tying member is further characterized to extend through said minimal clearance region in a manner to serve as a shield between workpieces. 4. The workpiece positioner of claim 1, which further includes workpiece holder drive means for selectively rotating at least one said workpiece holder in each said set and independently rotating each workpiece about said second common axis and said third common axis. 5. A workpiece positioner for use with an associated robot, which includes: a pair of generally vertical disposed laterally displaced and opposing workpiece holder supports; and a pair of workpiece holders operably connected to said workpiece holder supports, said pair of workpiece holders including a first set of workpiece holders and a second set of workpiece holders, wherein each said set of workpiece holders includes a first workpiece holder and second workpiece holder which are operably associated with one of said workpiece holder supports such that said first workpiece holders are opposing and generally coaxially aligned with said respective second workpiece holders and said workpiece holders rotate about a first generally horizontal common axis with respect to said vertical workpiece holder supports, further said first set of workpiece holders are rotatably driven about a second common axis and said second set of workpiece holders are rotatably driven about a third common axis and which when said first and said second set of workpiece holders are in an operating position are disposed at least partially on an opposite side of a plane which runs generally perpendicular to said vertical workpiece holder support and through said horizontal common axis, wherein when said workpiece positioner is disposed adjacent the robot, said first workpiece holders and said second workpiece holders rotate in a manner such that at least one said first workpiece holders and said second workpiece holders occupies a loading position below said plane while said other of said first workpiece holders and said second workpiece holders occupies an work position adjacent the robot above said plane. 6. The workpiece positioner of claim 5, wherein said workpiece holders are interconnected by a support tying member which is configured to provide a minimal clearance region between two workpieces operably disposed on and between said workpiece holders, wherein said support tying member runs through said first generally horizontal axis has a first portion forming an acute angle with respect to said horizontal plane and a second portion forming an obtuse angle with respect to said horizontal plane. 7. The workpiece positioner of claim 6, wherein said support tying member is further characterized to extend through said minimal clearance region in a manner to serve as a shield between workpieces. 8. The workpiece positioner of claim 5, which further includes workpiece holder drive means for selectively rotating at least one said workpiece holder in each said set and independently rotating each workpiece about said second common axis and said third common axis.
