A method for performing radiological-image-guided percutaneous surgery with a system which includes a radiological image generating device for generating an image of a target anatomy of a patient, and a needle insertion mechanism disposed adjacent the image generating device and having a needle adapted to be inserted into the patient. The method includes the steps of: determining a needle trajectory of the needle by positioning the image generating device for aligning, in the image generated by the image generating device, a desired skin insertion site of the patient with a target region of the target anatomy; locking the needle in a direction of the needle trajectory; and repositioning the image generating device to obtain a lateral view of the needle trajectory for viewing an insertion depth and path of the needle during its insertion into the patient. Moreover, a motion transmission mechanism includes an output shaft and an output shaft driver which has two rotational components having respective contact faces between which the output shaft is pressed for frictional engagement therewith. The frictional engagement creates a force between the output shaft and the rotational components which is parallel to the rotational axis of the rotational components for allowing the rotational components to impart a translational motion to the output shaft by virtue of their rotational motion.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for performing radiological-image-guided percutaneous surgery with a system which includes a radiological image generating device for generating an image of a target anatomy of a patient to be operated on, and a needle insertion mechanism having a needle adapted to be inserted into the patient, the method comprising: determining a needle trajectory of the needle by positioning the image generating device for aligning a desired skin insertion site on the patient with a target region of the target anatomy in an image generated by the image generating device; locking the needle along the needle trajectory, the locking being performed by pressing the needle between first and second contact faces of rotational components provided in the needle insertion mechanism such that an axial force directed parallel to a rotational axis of the rotational components effects frictional engagement between the contact faces and the needle, and such that as the rotational components rotate about the rotational axis, the frictional engagement effects a translational motion of the needle; and repositioning the image generating device to obtain a lateral view of the needle trajectory for viewing an insertion depth and path of the needle during insertion thereof into the patient. 2. The method for performing radiological-image-guided percutaneous surgery according to claim 1, wherein the locking is carried out by the needle insertion mechanism and at least portions of the needle insertion mechanism comprise radiolucent material so as to permit x-rays to pass through the needle insertion mechanism and permit a substantially unobstructed fluoroscopic image. 3. A system for performing radiological-image-guided percutaneous surgery, comprising: a radiological image generating device for generating an image of a target anatomy of a patent to be operated on, the image generating device being positionable to generate an image of the target anatomy from a plurality of directions, whereby, in the image generated by the image generating device, a desired skin insertion site can be aligned with a target region of the target anatomy, to determine a needle trajectory to be followed through the patient; and a needle insertion mechanism disposed adjacent the image generating device and having a needle adapted to be inserted into the patient, said needle insertion mechanism comprising radiolucent material so as to allow x-rays to pass therethrough and permit a substantially unobstructed fluoroscopic image, and being constructed and arranged to lock the needle in a direction of the needle trajectory determined with said radiological image generating device. 4. The system according to claim 3, wherein the needle insertion mechanism comprises: a first rotational component defining a first contact face and being constructed and arranged to rotate about a rotational axis; and a second rotational component coaxial with the first rotational component and defining a second contact face facing the first contact face and spaced therefrom, the needle being spaced from the rotational axis and further being pressed between the contact faces thereby applying an axial force to each of the contact faces directed parallel to the rotational axis, the axial force effecting a frictional engagement of the needle with the contact faces, the second rotational component further being rotatable about the rotational axis such that, when the rotational components rotate about the rotational axis, the friction engagement of the needle with the contact faces effects a translation motion of the needle.
