Novel nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins involved in the synthesis and assembly of core lipopolysaccharide in P. aeruginosa; and novel proteins encoded by the nucleic acid molecules are described. Methods are disclosed for detecting P.aeruginosa in a sample by determining the presence of the proteins or a nucleic acid molecule encoding the proteins in the sample.
Claims We claimed: 1. A purified and isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein involved in the synthesis and assembly of core lipopolysaccharide in P. aeruginosa which comprises (a) a nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein T can also be (b) a nucleic acid sequence fully complementary to the sequence as claimed in (a); or (c) a nucleic acid molecule differing from the nucleic acid sequence as claimed in (a) or (b) in codon sequences due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. 2. A recombinant molecule for transformation of a host cell comprising the nucleic acid molecule as claimed in claim 1 and an expression control sequence operatively linked to the nucleic acid molecule. 3. A transformant host cell including the recombinant molecule as claimed in claim 1. 4. A kit for detecting the presence of the nucleic acid molecule as claimed in claim 1 in a sample comprising a nucleotide probe that hybridizes with the nucleic acid molecule under stringent hybridization conditions which use 6.0.times. sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45.degree. C., followed by a wash of 2.0.times.SSC at about 50.degree. C.
