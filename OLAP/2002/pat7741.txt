An improved welding robot has the power fed to the welding nozzle through a slip-ring assembly so that the power cable does not have to rotate as the welding nozzle rotates during a circular welding process.
Claims What I claim is: 1. A welding robot comprising a welding nozzle, said welding nozzle containing a welding electrode; an electrical slip-ring assembly with slip-rings mutually rotatable about a common concentric axis, maintaining electrical contact during rotation, and being conductively connected to said welding electrode; said welding nozzle being coupled to a flexible gas supply tube; said electrical slip-ring assembly being connected to an electrical power supply cable; wherein said slip-ring assembly feeds electrical power to said welding electrode, in use, from said supply cable with said cable remaining in a substantially fixed position when said welding nozzle is caused to rotate about said axis. 2. A welding robot comprising a welding nozzle, a welding electrode being contained within said nozzle; a mount rotatable about an axis, an electrical slip-ring assembly with slip-rings mutually rotatable about said axis, which is a common concentric axis, and being conductively connected to each other during rotation and to said welding electrode, said slip-ring assembly being insulatingly mounted on said mount; said welding nozzle being coupled to a flexible gas supply tube; said electrical slip-ring assembly being connected to an electrical power supply cable; wherein said slip-ring assembly feeds electrical power to said welding electrode, in use, from said supply cable with said cable remaining in a substantially fixed position when said welding nozzle is caused to rotate about said axis. 3. A slip-ring assembly comprising an insulating mounting member for attachment to a welding robot, conductive slip-rings being held on the mounting member for mutual rotation about an axis which in use coincides with an axis of rotation of the robot, an attachment for attaching an input power cable on one slip-ring, a power feed for feeding power from the other slip-ring to the welding electrode in use, and a compression bias to hold the slip-rings in mutual electrical contact during rotation.
