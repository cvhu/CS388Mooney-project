The invention provides novel polynucleotides isolated from cDNA libraries of human fetal liver-spleen and fetal liver as well as polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides. The polypeptide is a human chemokine receptor that is a member of a family of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains. Other aspects of the invention include vectors containing polynucleotides of the invention and related host cells as well a processes for producing chemokine receptor polypeptides, and antibodies specific for such polypeptides.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated polynucleotide comprising: (a) a polynucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3; (b) the complement of (a); or (c) the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. 2. The isolated polynucleotide of claim 1 wherein said polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 3. 3. The isolated polynucleotide of claim 2 wherein said polynucleotide comprises DNA. 4. The isolated polynucleotide of claim 3 wherein said polynucleotide is SEQ ID NO: 2. 5. A vector comprising the polynucleotide of claim 1. 6. A host cell comprising the vector of claim 5. 7. A process for producing a polypeptide comprising culturing the host cell of claim 6 under conditions that allow expression of the polypeptide encoded by said polynucleotide in said vector. 8. An isolated polynucleotide comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. 9. The full complement of the polynucleotide of claim 2 or 8.
