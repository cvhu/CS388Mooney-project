A method for feeding containers into an analytical instrument whereby a sample handler moves and positions racks, containing sample tubes, into, within and out of the analytical instrument. The sample handler has an in-feed and out-feed that advance sample tube racks using a walking beam mechanism. The racks are seated within the in-feed and are transported onto a cross-feed. The cross-feed moves the racks to a position behind the out-feed where the walking beam mechanism moves the tube racks out of the analytical instrument.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for feeding containers sitting in a rack, having a left side and a right side and a tab on each of said right and left sides, into an instrument, said instrument comprising a sample handler comprising an infeed having a first walking beam mechanism, an outfeed having a first set of right and left side walls from which said rack may be suspended by said tabs and a second walking beam mechanism comprising a movable tray having a second set of right and left side walls from which said rack may be suspended by said tabs and a first pair of detents on opposite side walls of said first and second set of side walls, and a cross-feed adjacent said infeed and outfeed, inputting said rack into said infeed, transferring said rack from said infeed to a first position on said cross-feed using said first walking beam mechanism, transporting said rack on said cross-feed from said first position adjacent said infeed to a second position on said cross-feed adjacent said outfeed, and activating said second walking beam mechanism to move a portion of said tray above said cross-feed to capture said rack within said side walls of said tray. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said tray has a second pair of detents on opposite side walls of said first and second sets of side walls separated from said first pair of detents by a ridge and said method further comprises transferring said rack from said first pair of detents to said second pair of detents using said second walking beam mechanism.
