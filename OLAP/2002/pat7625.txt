Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Inhibitor of DNA binding-1. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Inhibitor of DNA binding-1. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Inhibitor of DNA binding-1 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Inhibitor of DNA binding-1 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 11, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 47, 52, 58, 59, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, or 86 which inhibits the expression of human Inhibitor of DNA binding-1. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Inhibitor of DNA binding-1 in cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Inhibitor of DNA binding-1 is inhibited. 11. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 12. The composition of claim 11 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 13. The composition of claim 11 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
