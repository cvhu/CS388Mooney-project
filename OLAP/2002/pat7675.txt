A method and an industrial robotic device for uniformly applying coatings at appropriate thickness and pitch upon a surface moves a spray applicator foam dispenser between two parallel tracks. The uniform application of foam at each pass is assured, by accelerating the speed of the foam dispenser at the end of each pass, by providing respective curved uphill distal ends of the tracks, so that the spray applicator foam dispenser moves up the curved distal ends and returns quickly while changing speed tilt and direction at the end of each pass.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of making an in situ, filed applied surface membrane upon a roof surface comprising the steps of: applying by a spray a first layer of spontaneously rising and curable polyurethane foam upon a roof surface; during said spontaneously rising and curing of said polyurethane foam, applying a second layer of a reinforced open mesh layer having fibers therein over said polyurethane foam; permitting said polyurethane foam to rise through and over said fibers of said reinforced open mesh layer, thereby imbedding said mesh therebetween; applying a coating over said first and second layers; and, allowing said curable polyurethane foam to cure into a hardened state and become inseparable and monolithic. 2. The method of making an in situ, filed applied surface membrane upon a roof surface as in claim 1 further comprising the step of applying said reinforced open mesh layer from a continuous roll, wherein a free end of said second layer of reinforced open mesh is fed from said continuous roll under a rotating roller which contacts an upper portion of said spray applied first layer of spontaneously rising and curable polyurethane foam upon said roof surface.
