This invention provides methods of obtaining pest resistance genes that are improved over naturally occurring genes for use in conferring upon plants resistance to pests. The methods involve the use of DNA shuffling of pest resistance genes to produce libraries of recombinant pest resistance genes, which are then screened to identify those that exhibit the improved property or properties of interest.
