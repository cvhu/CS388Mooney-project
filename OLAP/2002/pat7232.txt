The present invention provides an integrated, fully automated, high-throughput system for two-dimensional electrophoresis comprised of gel-making machines, gel processing machines, gel compositions and geometries, gel handling systems, sample preparation systems, software and methods. The system is capable of continuous operation at high-throughput to allow construction of large quantitative data sets.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated computer-controlled method for isolating one or more selected macromolecules in a gel, the gel having been subjected to a two-dimensional electrophoresis process, the method comprising: (a) laying only the gel smoothly on a scanning platform in the absence of an attached backing material; (b) scanning the gel to generate a gel image or replica thereof; (c) analyzing the gel image or a replica thereof, said analyzing step including comparing spot patterns in the gel image with master 2-D patterns to establish spot identities; and (d) isolating a selected macromolecule with a spot excision device in an automated fashion following the analysis of the gel image by removing a portion of the gel containing the selected protein based on said analyzing step. 2. An automated computer-controlled method as set forth in claim 1, wherein said analyzing step includes generating spot abundance data. 3. An automated computer-controlled method as set forth in claim 2, wherein said analyzing step includes generating spot position data. 4. An automated computer-controlled method as set forth in claim 3, wherein said analyzing step includes subtracting image background. 5. An automated computer-controlled method as set forth in claim 4, further comprising the step of storing the spot patterns in the gel image, the established spot identities, the spot position and abundance data in a database.
