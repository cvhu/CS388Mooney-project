The present invention relates to a wire harness retainer stud adhesively bonded to an automobile body panel. This stud is used to mount a wire harness to automobile body panels. The stud contains a contact adhesive and an uncured adhesive. The contact adhesive is used to mount the stud to the body panel until the stud and panel are heated to cure the uncured adhesive, thereby bonding the stud to the panel. A method of, and apparatus for, automated assembly of the stud is also disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an automated equipment environment, an apparatus for automated assembly of a retainer stud to a panel with a robotic arm, the stud having a circular flat plate having a shaft face and a seal face, the faces parallel to one another, a shaft disposed upon the shaft face of the plate having slip engaging means for communicating with a retainer clip, a resilient annular seal having a plate surface and an adhesive surface, the surfaces parallel to one another, the plate surface attached to the seal face of the plate, the annular seal having a central cavity, a contact adhesive coating on the adhesive surface of the seal for mounting the stud on the panel, an uncured adhesive in the central cavity of the seal which when cured will bond the seal to the panel, the contact adhesive protected by a removable backing wafer attached to the stud by the contact adhesive, the wafer being larger than the plate and the seal of the stud, the apparatus for automated assembly of a retainer stud comprising: a housing; a stud guide mounted to the housing forming a longitudinal passage between the housing and the stud guide, the stud guide having a longitudinal slot and an opening, the slot and opening communicating with the passage, the slot and passage designed to allow movement of the stud and wafer assemblies through the passage to the opening, the plate and the seal of the stud and wafer assembly in the passage and the shaft of the stud extending outward through the slot, the opening being larger than the plate and the seal but smaller than the wafer; a tube attached to the top of the housing and stud guide to feed stud and wafer assemblies into the passage; a plurality of mount guides extending rearward from the housing; a carriage slidably mounted on the mount guides; a spring mounted on each of the mount guides to bias the carriage to a predetermined location; an air cylinder mounted between the housing and the carriage for moving the carriage in opposition to the springs; a locating guide; a pair of end stops mounted on the locating guide to define the motion limits of the carriage; a lower retaining nest mounted to the carriage and extending through the passage to retain a stud and wafer assembly in the passage behind the opening in the stud guide with other stud and wafer assemblies stacked above the stud and wafer assembly behind the opening in the stud guide when the carriage is against one end stop, the lower retaining nest moves out of the passage, allowing the empty wafer to pass through the passage when the carriage is moved against the other end stop after the stud has been removed from the wafer through the opening by the robotic arm; an upper retaining nest mounted to the carriage and extending through the passage to retain the stud and wafer assemblies in the passage above the opening in the stud guide when the lower retaining nest has been moved out of the passage to allow the empty wafer to pass through the passage, the upper retaining nest moves out of the passage when lower retaining nest moves into the passage, allowing a stud and wafer assembly to drop down in the passage behind the opening in the stud guide. 2. In an automated equipment environment, an apparatus for automated assembly of a retainer stud to a panel with a robotic arm, the stud having a circular flat plate having a shaft face and a seal face, the faces parallel to one another, a shaft disposed upon the shaft face of the plate having clip engaging means for communicating with a retainer clip, a resilient annular seal having a plate surface and an adhesive surface, the surfaces parallel to one another, the plate surface attached to the seal face of the plate, the annular seal having a central cavity, a contact adhesive coating on the adhesive surface of the seal for mounting the stud on the panel, an uncured adhesive in the central cavity of the seal which when cured will bond the seal to the panel, the contact adhesive protected by a removable backing wafer attached to the stud by the contact adhesive, the wafer being larger than the plate and the seal of the stud, the apparatus for automated assembly of a retainer stud comprising: a housing; a stud guide mounted to the housing forming a longitudinal passage between the housing and the stud guide, the stud guide having a longitudinal slot and an opening, the slot and opening communicating with the passage, the slot and passage designed to allow movement of the stud and wafer assemblies through the passage to the opening, the plate and the seal of the stud and wafer assembly in the passage and the shaft of the stud extending outward through the slot, the opening being larger than the plate and the seal but smaller than the wafer; a tube attached to the top of the housing and stud guide to feed stud and wafer assemblies into the passage; a plurality of mount guides extending rearward from the housing; a carriage slidably mounted on the mount guides; an air cylinder mounted between the housing and the carriage having a non-actuated position and an actuated position, the air cylinder, when actuated, moves the carriage rearward, away from the housing; a spring mounted on each of the mount guides to move the carriage forward, toward the housing, when the air cylinder is in the non-actuated position; a locating guide; a forward pair of jam nuts mounted on the locating guide to stop the forward motion of the carriage in the non-actuated position; a rearward pair of jam nuts mounted on the locating guide to stop the rearward motion of the carriage in the actuated position; a lower retaining nest mounted to the carriage and extending through the passage to retain a stud and wafer assembly in the passage behind the opening in the stud guide with other stud and wafer assemblies stacked above the stud and wafer assembly behind the opening in the stud guide when the air cylinder is in the non-actuated position, the lower retaining nest moves out of the passage, allowing the empty wafer to pass through the passage when the air cylinder is in the actuated position after the stud has been removed from the wafer through the opening by the robotic arm; an upper retaining nest mounted to the carriage and extending through the passage to retain the stud and wafer assemblies in the passage above the opening in the stud guide when the air cylinder is in the actuated position, the upper retaining nest moves out of the passage when the air cylinder is in the non-actuated position, allowing a stud and wafer assembly to drop down in the passage behind the opening in the stud guide.
