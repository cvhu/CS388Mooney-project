Improved process and apparatus for assembling component parts by means of rivets or similar fasteners in which computer controlled robotic machining centers present selected tools in predetermined special position on opposing sides of the components which are held stationary in a fixture. The robots prepare the rivet holes at multiple selected locations, followed by repositioning of roboticly controlled tools at each hole location for the installation of the fasteners. Throughout hole preparation and fastener installation novel end effectors maintain a symmetrical balance of forces on the components in a manner which avoids stressing and deformation of the components, holding fixture and end assembly.
