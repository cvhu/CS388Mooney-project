An improved apparatus and method for feeding a large volume of electrical components to a vision controlled robotic placement apparatus is provided. Electrical components in a reeled pocketed carrier tape are indexed along a dereeling component feeder to a pick up station. Forward advance of the carrier is stopped when an optical sensor in the feeder senses that a depending pocket in the carrier tape is generally positioned at the pick up station. The vision control system on the robot is relied upon to locate the pocket at the pick up station and to locate the individual components presented in the pocket. The components are robotically unloaded from the carrier one at a time and placed on a printed circuit board assembly at a second station with the guidance of the vision control system. As the last component is picked up for placement, the vision control system signals the carrier tape drive to index the next pocket to the pick up station. In accordance with the invention, multiple parts may be presented in each pocket. The carrier tape and feeder are less precise and much less expensive because the vision system is relied upon to perform the location functions required for accurate robotic parts acquisition and placement.
Claims We claim: 1. In an arrangement for automatically moving electrical components from a first station to a second station, said arrangement including: a first station whereat a plurality of electrical components are delivered for movement; component feeder means for supplying electrical components to said first station, said feeder means including a reeled carrier supply of electrical components having a continuous carrier tape with spaced apart component-receiving pockets defined therein extending the length thereof, electrical components disposed in said pockets; and indexing means for positioning one pocket at a time at said first station; a second station spaced from said first station whereat electrical components moved from said first station are positioned; robotic mover means including a robot arm having a free end; gripper means for gripping an electrical component mounted on said free end, said gripper means being actuable between a closed gripping position and an open release position; gripper control means for actuating said gripper means between said open and closed positions; and arm drive means for moving the free end and gripper means between said first station and said second station; vision system control means for obtaining visual information at the first and second stations, analyzing said information and directing the robot arm drive means and gripper control means on the basis of said analyzed visual information; and the improvement in said component feeder means comprising: each pocket including a plurality of similar electrical components disposed therein in a single orientation; said indexing means including a carrier tape drive path extending through said first station, tape drive means for moving the carrier tape along said drive path toward the first station actuable between an on position and an off position, drive control means for actuating the tape drive means between said on and off positions, optical sensing means disposed adjacent said drive path at said first station for sensing when a pocket is located at said first station, whereupon said drive control means actuates the tape drive means to said off position in response thereto; and said drive control means actuating the tape drive to said on position in response to a direction from said vision system control means. 2. The arrangement of claim 1, wherein said tape drive means includes a tape drive motor and a pair of tape drive wheels positioned for frictional engagement with said carrier tape along the drive path, said drive wheels being rotatable in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction by means of said tape drive motor. 3. The arrangement of claim 1, wherein said optical sensing means includes an optical proximity sensor disposed at the first station along the underside of said tape drive path for sensing a depending pocket extending from the carrier tape in said drive path at the first station. 4. The arrangement of claim 1, further including illumination means in said indexing means disposed below said tape drive path adjacent the first station for back lighting a pocket positioned at the first station. 5. A method for automatically moving electrical components from a first station to a second station, said method including the steps of providing a first station whereat a plurality of electrical components are delivered for movement; providing a reeled carrier supply of electrical components including a continuous carrier tape having spaced apart component receiving pockets defined therein extending the length thereof with electrical components in said pockets; intermittently driving said carrier tape along a drive path extending through the first station to position one pocket at a time to said first station; providing a second station spaced from said first station whereat electrical components moved from said first station are positioned; and providing a vision system controlled robotic placement means including gripper means for gripping an electrical component from a pocket at the first station and moving it to the second station and positioning and releasing the electrical component at the second station; the improvement in said intermittent driving step comprising; providing a plurality of electrical components in each pocket; optically sensing the presence of a pocket generally at the first station; stopping the carrier tape in response to said optical sensing to provide a pocket generally at the first station; using the vision system control to locate the pocket and the electrical components in the pocket at the first station; robotically moving the electrical components in the pocket at the first station one at a imte until the last electrical component is being moved; and starting the carrier tape in response to a signal from the vision system control that the last electrical component is being moved to drive the next pocket to the first station.
