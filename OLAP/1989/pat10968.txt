Automated manufacturing equipment (10) such as robot arms for performing a manufacturing operation on a work piece (12) have a relatively stationary host machine (14) with central programmable logic means (16) which receive various parametric inputs (26) and thereby control movement and operation of a machine element (18) suspended at the end of an articulated arm (20) for positioning with respect to the work piece in response to the control signals. A small programmable logic controller (30) disposed for movement with the machine element receives inputs and performs local AND/OR logic on a number of input signals from transducers (28) measuring various parameters associated with movable machine elements. The local I/O device then performs selective AND/OR ladder logic functions on the transducer output signals and outputs a single resultant signal as a function thereof in real-time to the central logic means.
