An apparatus and method is described for inserting pins in holes wherein either the pin or the hole is chamfered or beveled. One part is vibrated with respect to the other in a plane orthogonal to the direction of insertion. One part is incrementarlly moved in the direction of insertion. When interference caused by the contact is sensed, the magnitude of the interference is determined and used to reposition the center-line of the one part in the orthogonal plane until the pin is fully inserted.
Claims We claim: 1. Apparatus for inserting a part having a cylindrical projecting end into a hole in another part, wherein either the hole or the projection is beveled, comprising: (a) gripper means for holding one part adjacent the other with the projecting end nearest the hole and generally aligned therewith; (b) shaker means for vibrating one part in relation to the other part in a plane orthogonal to the direction of insertion of said projecting end into said hole; (c) controller means for moving one part with respect to the other in the direction of insertion until contact is made between the end of the projection and the edge of said hole; (d) sensor means for sensing such contact and generating an interference signal proportional thereto; (e) signal processor means for processing said signal and coupling said signal to said controller means, which controller means, in response to said signal, repositions one part in said orthogonal plane in a direction which reduces or eliminates said interference until the projection is completely inserted in the hole. 2. Apparatus for inserting one projecting part into an opening in another part, said opening having a central axis defining a center line wherein one part is vibrated with respect to the other in a plane orthogonal to the direction of insertion comprising: (a) mans for repetitively moving one part an increment in the direction of insertion; (b) means for repetitively sensing contact interference between the two parts and generating a signal proportional to the magnitude and sense thereof; and (c) means for repetitively repositioning the center line of the opening in one part with respect to the other in the orthogonal plane in response to said generated signal and thereafter incrementally moving said one part in the direction of insertion until the projecting part is fully inserted.
