A control processor in a robotic system treats optically sensed locations along the seam path ahead of the tool, which are classified in relation to elapsed distances and identified in 3-D coordinates and 3-axes tool orientation, to apply in real time and under feedforward a control signal representing the error between anticipated tool position and anticipated sensed location on the path. In the process, the anticipated sensed location is obtained by interpolation between acutally sensed locations. A taught path is recovered from the robot. The control processor operation is also based on elapsed distances and related to actual tool position provided by the robot.
