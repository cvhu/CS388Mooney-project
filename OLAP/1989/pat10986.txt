A walking beam conveyor (54) delivers drill bits (B), one at a time, into a feed position. A pushrod (52) moves a drill bit (B) from the feed position into the nosepiece (36) of a robot arm (28). The drill bit (B) enters the nosepiece (36) shank end first. The shank (84) enters into and is gripped by a collet (38) in the nosepiece (36). A stylus (66) is then lowered down onto the point end portion of the drill bit (B) and the drill bit (B) is rotated about its axis until the stylus (66) drops down to the bottom of the drill bit flute (70). Rotation is immediately stopped and the robot arm (28) is retracted and swung into a position of alignemnt with a drill bit holder (18) of a sharpening machine. The robot arm (28) is then extended to place the drill bit (B) into a collet (C) in the holder (18). The collet (C) is operated to grasp the drill bit (B) and the collet (38) in the nosepiece (36) is operated to release the drill bit (B). The holder (18) then moves in position to in turn move the point of the drill bit (B) into contact with a surface of a rotating grinding wheel (14). The drill bit (B) was rotated while in the nosepiece (36) to in that manner orient the point surfaces of the drill bit for proper contact with the grinding wheel (14). Oversized and undersized drill bits (B), and drill bits (B) with excessive material buildup, are detected and rejected.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Mechanism for sharpening drill bits, comprising: a grinding machine including a rotary grinding wheel, a drill bit holder for receiving a drill bit, point end first, and moving it against the grinding wheel during a grinding cycle, said drill bit holder including a holder collet comprising a plurality of angularly spaced jaws, said jaws together defining a central drill bit receiving opening, spring means normally biasing the jaws apart, to establish an opening position for such collet, in which the drill bit receiving opening is larger than a drill bit to be received in it, means for squeezing the jaws of the collet, in opposition to the spring force, for moving the jaws together, to reduce the size of the opening, said opening having a designed minimum size which is reached when the jaws are squeezed an amount sufficient that they contact each other; a robotic feeder for feeding drill bits into the drill bit holder, including a drill bit carrier having a carrier collet which is movable between open and closed positions, said carrier collet being in axial alignment with the holder collet when the carrier is in its drill bit inserting position, and means for extending and retracting the carrier collet along its axis, when it is in axial alignment with the holder collet, said carrier collet having an open position of a size which provides frictional engagement of the collet with a drill bit to be sharpened, resulting in a drill bit staying in the carrier collet until it is pulled relatively out from the carrier collet, means for moving the drill bit carrier between a drill bit receiving position and a drill bit inserting position, whereby, if a drill bit to be sharpened is inserted by the robotic feeder into the drill bit holder, and the holder collet is squeezed to close it, and such holder collet reaches the minimum size of the opening without gripping the drill bit, due to the drill bit being undersized, the frictional fit of the drill bit in the carrier collet will causes the drill bit to stay with the carrier; sensor means operable to detect an undersized drill bit in the carrier, when the carrier is being moved back from its drill bit inserting position to its drill bit receiving position; and reject means operable by detection of an undersized drill bit in the carrier, for removing the undersized drill bit, so that a new drill bit can be inserted into the carrier collet, for delivery to be sharpening machine. 2. Mechanism according to claim 1, wherein the drill bit carrier comprises an elongated arm assembly and means for swinging the arm assembly in position about a generally vertical axis, and wherein the drill bit receiving position is at one end of the swing path and the drill bit inserting position is at the opposite end of the swing path. 3. Mechanism according to claim 2, wherein the sensor means for detecting an undersized drill bit in the carrier is of a type and is positioned to detect the presence of a drill bit in the carrier collet during swinging movement of the arm assembly from its drill bit inserting position back to its drill bit receiving position. 4. Mechanism according to claim 3, wherein the reject means comprises a gripper mechanism positioned above and endwise outwardly of the carrier collet when the carrier is in its drill bit receiving position, and means for lifting the arm assembly and moving an undersized drill bit in the carrier collet into a position to be gripped by the gripper means, and means for actuating the gripper means to grasp the drill bit when it is so positioned, and means for retracting the carrier collet away from the drill bit. 5. Mechanism for sharpening drill bits, comprising: a grinding machine including a rotary grinding wheel, a drill bit holder for receiving a drill bit to be sharpened, point end first, and moving it against the grinding wheel during a grinding cycle, said drill bit holder including a holder collet and a bushing positioned between the holder collet and the grinding wheel, said bushing including an opening sized to be only slightly larger in diameter than the diameter of the drill bit to be sharpened, whereby an oversized drill bit will not extend into and through the bushing; a robotic feeder for feeding drill bits into the drill bit holder, including a drill bit carrier having a carrier collet having a closed position in which it tightly grips a drill bit in the carrier collet, and an open position in which the drill bit can be pulled relatively out from the carrier collet; and means responsive to a drill bit in the carrier collet which is oversized and thus cannot fit into the opening in the bushing in the drill bit holder, for moving the carrier and the oversized drill bit therein away from the drill bit holder and into a reject position; and means at the reject position for removing the oversized drill bit from the carrier collet. 6. Mechanism according to claim 5, wherein the drill bit carrier comprises an elongated arm assembly including an elongated housing and an elongated arm which is retractable and extendible into and out from the elongated housing, and the carrier collet is at the outer end of the arm, and said robotic feeder includes means for extending the arm towards the drill bit holder, while a drill bit is in the carrier collet and such drill bit is in axial alignment with the bushing in the holder, and sensor means for detecting when the arm has reached a fully extended position and has inserted the drill bit through the bushing and into a position for grinding, said sensor means being inoperable when there is an oversized drill bit in the collet holder which cannot fit through the bushing, because the inability of the drill bit to extend through the bushing prevents the arm from reaching its fully extended position; and control means including timer means for retracting the arm and moving it and the oversized drill bit into the reject position, in response to the arm not reaching its fully extended position within a predetermined time following the start of arm extension. 7.
