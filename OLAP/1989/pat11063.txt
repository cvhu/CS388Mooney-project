Arrangements for detecting the presence of an opaque object in an area, such as a person in a robotic work cell. Multiple light sources, light reflecting surfaces, light boxes with hole patterns or fiber optic light sources are spaced around the perimeter of the area and imaged by a camera. The change of the camera signal from its normal condition is used to interrupt power to safeguard personnel and/or machinery.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An arrangement for detecting the presence of an opaque object within a predetermined area and effecting a power interruption comprising: at least one light source means mounted on a structure; camera means for imaging said light source and converting said image to a video signal; recording means for recording a normal signal pattern of said video signal generated by said camera means; detecting means for detecting when said pattern is indicative of a significant loss of light received from said at least one light source; and control means for interrupting a flow of power upon detecting when said pattern is indicative of a significant loss of light received from said at least one light source. 2. An arrangement as defined in claim 1, wherein said light source means comprises a reflective surface illuminated by a light source. 3. An arrangement as defined in claim 2, including additional control means to vary reflectance or illumination. 4. An arrangement as defined in claim 9, wherein said light source means comprises means having at least one light source and having at least one hole to provide a light pattern for imaging. 5. An arrangement as defined in claim 1, wherein said light source means comprises at least one light source; a fiber optic bundle for collecting light from said light source; an opposite end of each fiber of said fiber optic bundle being placed to provide a light pattern for imaging. 6. An arrangement as defined in claim 1, wherein said light source means comprises a plurality of light sources.
