A stream calibration arrangement for visually determining the position and orientation of a sprayed material stream. Use of a stream calibration fixture to determine adjustments to an adjustable spray gun mount to realign a spray stream without altering the taught path of a robot carrying the spray gun. Alternatively, the stream is realigned by altering the taught robot path and requiring no gun mount adjustment. Stream realignment is also carried out automatically with and without gun mount adjustments. Machine vision is used for automatic stream realignment.
