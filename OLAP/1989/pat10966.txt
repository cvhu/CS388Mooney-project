The vane adjusting machine for increasing or decreasing the flow through a turbine nozzle includes a bending tool for attachment to a wrist of a robot arm whose operation and function is controlled by computer hardware and software. The bending tool preferably includes a floating head assembly and an interchangeable jaw sub-assembly. In operation, a turbine nozzle is subjected to an airflow test. Subsequently, the turbine nozzle is mounted on a rotatable work surface and a first vane is initialized to a bending station location. The bending tool controlled by the computer then locates and bends the first vane to a desired orientation based on the airflow test results. On completion of the bending of the first vane, the bending tool is removed from proximity with the first vane, and the computer controls the rotation of the worktable to position a second vane at the bending station location. Each vane on the turbine nozzle is subsequently bent to the desired orientation and, if desired, the turbine nozzle is subjected to a second airflow test to verify that the desired airflow characteristics have been achieved.
