An automatic robot structure includes a fixed location support 10 which carries three locational arms 12, 14, 16, being hingedly connected to each other at their location of convergence to support a workhead 20, the driving motors 12a, 14a, and 16a each being independently operable to drive its respective arm in an axial direction, each of the arms being rigid in the sense that no part of the arm is hingedly connected to another part, so that the forces derived from a payload weight subject the arms primarily only to compression and or tension.
Claims I claim: 1. A robotic manipulator for automatically positioning a workhead comprising: a support structure; three arms having their remote end portions hingedly connected together at a single location which is at least relatively close to the point of intersection of the axes of the three arms, said location being adjacent the workhead connected to said three arms, and having their proximate end portions carried in gimbaled relation from said support structure at spaced apart locations thereat together defining the points of a triangle; means for driving each arm axially and independently to move said workhead to different positions, said driving means being carried by said support structure and being fixed in location at said support structures, said workhead being in rigid relation to one of said three arms and spaced from said single location; each arm being substantially straight from its remote end portion to its proximate end portion and rigid for its length in the sense that no part of the arm is hingedly connected to another part so that the forces derived from the payload weight and movement subject said arms primarily only to compression and/or tension. 2. A manipulator according to claim 1 wherein: said proximate end portion of each said arm comprises an exteriorly-threaded element and, said driving means for each said arm includes electrically driven means rotating on said threaded element to move said arm axially without rotation of said arm. 3. A manipulator according to claim 2 wherein: at least said threaded end portions are hollow to minimize the weight of each said arm. 4. A robotic manipulator for automatically positioning a workhead comprising: a support structure; three arms having their remote end portions hingedly connected together at a single location which is at least relatively close to the point of intersection of the axes of the three arms, said location being adjacent the workhead connected to said three arms, and having their proximate end portions carried in gimbaled relation from said support structure at spaced apart locations thereat together defining the points of a triangle; means for driving each arm axially and independently to move said workhead to different locations, said driving means being carried by said support structure and being fixed in location at said support structure; each arm being substantially straight from its remote end portion to its proximate end portion and rigid for its length in the sense that no part of the arm is hingedly connected to another part so that the forces derived from the payload weight and movement subject said arms primarily only to compression and/or tension; at least one additional arm of the same character as the other three arms and having a support and drive arrangement corresponding to the arms, the remote end of said at least one additional arm being hingedly connected to said workhead at a location apart from the connection location of said other arms to said workhead so as to permit attitude positioning of said location positioning effected by said other three arms. 5. A robotic manipulator for automatically positioning a workhead comprising: a support structure; three arms having their remote end portions hingedly connected together at a single location which is at least relatively close to the point of intersection of the axes of the three arms, said location being adjacent the workhead connected to said three arms, and having their proximate end portions carried in gimbaled relation from said support structure at spaced apart locations thereat together defining the points of a triangle; means for driving each arm axially and independently to move said workhead to different locations, said driving means being carried by said support structure and being fixed in location at said support structure; each arm being substantially straight from its remote end portion to its proximate end portion and rigid for its length in the sense that no part of the arm is hingedly connected to another part so that the forces derived from the payload weight and movement subject said arms primarily only to compression and/or tension; a fourth arm and a fifth arm, both of the same character as the other three arms and having support and drive arrangements corresponding to the other three arms, the remote ends of both said fourth and fifth arms being hingedly connected to said workhead at locations spaced apart from each other, and spaced apart from the connection location of said other arms to said workhead, so as to permit attitude positioning of said workhead independently of said locational positioning effected by said other three arms. 6. A manipulator according to claim 5 wherein: said connection locations to said workhead form a triangle in which the three arm connection is vertically spaced from the connection location of said fourth and said fifth arms, so that movement of said fourth and fifth arms axially together effects a tilting movement of said workhead about one axis and differential axial movement between said fourth and fifth arms effects swiveling of said workhead about another axis. 7. A manipulator according to claim 5 including a sixth element extending from said support structure to said workhead and being rotatable to rotate a working device carried by said workhead about a third axis normal to the axes of tilt and swivel. 8. A robotic manipulator for automatically positioning a workhead comprising: a support structure; three arms having their remote end portions hingedly connected together at a single location which is at least relatively close to the point of intersection of the axes of the three arms, said location being adjacent the workhead connected to said three arms, and having their proximate end portions carried in gimbaled relation from said support structure at spaced apart locations thereat together defining the points of a triangle; means for deriving each arm axially and independently to move said workhead to different locations, said driving means being carried by said support structure and being fixed in location at said support structure; each arm being substantially straight from its remote end portion to its proximate end portion and rigid for its length in the sense that no part of the arm is hingedly connected to another part so that the forces derived from the payload weight and movement subject said arms primarily only to compression and/or tension; said proximate end portion of each said arm comprises an exteriorly-threaded element and, said driving means for each said arm includes electrically driven means rotating on said threaded element to move said arm axially without rotation of said arm; at least said threaded end portions are hollow; said arms are hollow for their length to an opening located at a point relatively close to said hinge location; and workhead driving means extending through at least one of said hollow arms and connected to said workhead. 9. A manipulator according to claim 8 wherein: said workhead driving means comprises a rotatable element.
