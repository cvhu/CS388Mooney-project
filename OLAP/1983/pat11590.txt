The computer robot arm chess game assembly is provided with a chess board, magnetized chess pieces, auxiliary parking locations for the chess pieces, and an articulated radially moving robot arm. The robot arm can perform all the functions of an opponent including setting up the chess board, captures, promotions, castling, etc. The chess board and parking locations include magnetic members to not only activate resilient switches but further to spatially position the chess pieces for accurate location to assist the robot arm. Among the other interesting features, the robot arm can show emotional characteristics which can be accompanied by appropriate sounds and lights contemporaneous with a significant occurrence during the progress of the chess game.
