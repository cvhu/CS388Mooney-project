The CAP-PAP Test is a double-staining, single-slide microscopic method. An in vitro diagnostic medical device for manual and automatic staining and interpreting of the Pap smear for cervical cancer screening, cervical dysplasia and for follow-up therapy can be developed using this double-staining, single-slide microscopic method. Abnormal cervical cells are labeled with an intracellular acid phosphatase derived pigment (azo-dye) to improve visibility of abnormal cervical cells on conventionally stained Pap smears. The enzyme marker improves human perception and/or sensitivity of automatic instruments when distinguishing cell a abnormality and interpretation of Pap smears. Increased accuracy of CAP-PAP-vs-Pap test is expected to reduce false negative readings of the conventional Pap test. A rapid manual version of the test that is low cost, does not require additional personnel training and is instantly applicable in all cytopathology laboratories is provided. The invention further provides a diagnostic kit, an automatic stainer and an automatic evaluation device for performing the double-staining, single-slide microscopic method.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for in vitro labeling of abnormal cervical cells with an acid phosphatase enzyme reaction product that increases visibility of said cells on Pap smears, comprising the steps of: a) scrapping cervical epithelium by an abrasive device, b) obtaining an analytical specimen composed of cervical cells from more than one layer of cervical epithelium, c) spreading said specimen over a microscopic slide to form a smear of separated cells, d) exposing said smears to air fixation before transporting to a laboratory, e) exposing said smears to fixation with a solution containing at least citrate acetone or formaldehyde at room temperature, f) incubating said smears, after fixation, with an incubation mixture containing at least a diazonium salt and a naphthol phosphate in water, for time, temperature and pH, optimal for said acid phosphatase reaction to complete, g) exposing said smears, after incubation, to staining with a modified Papanicolaou staining method, h) mounting said smears after completion of said Papanicolaou staining, and i) investigating said smears, after mounting, under a microscope using new criteria for classification of smears stained by the CAP-PAP test, whereby said method allow a human observer, or a machine, to diagnose said specimens into categories of negative, nonnegative or positive for cervical dysplasia and/or cervical cancer. 2. A kit which comprises a carrying box comprising: a) labeled bottles containing reagents for use in a method for in vitro labeling of abnormal cervical cells with an acid phosphatase enzyme reaction, b) control slides, comprising (1) microscopic slides with HeLa cells smeared on, and (2) microscopic slides stained with HeLa cells, and c) written instructions for using said reagents to perform said method on analytical specimens obtained from healthy women or patients, and d) written instructions for using said HeLa smears for quality control and/or quality assurance of said method. 3. An assembly of instruments comprising at least a) an automatic mechanical device to combine all steps of a method for in vitro labeling of abnormal cervical cells with an acid phosphatase enzyme reaction into a continuous stepwise procedure, comprising: i) a train to carry unstained smears throughout a series of stations, and ii) a series of stations providing technical facility for performance of every step of the staining procedure, and iii) a motor to move said train with smears throughout said stations and said staining procedure, whereby said devices are combined into an automatic staining device for processing said marker and making said smears instantly available for human evaluation and classification into categories; and b) an assembly of microscopic image analysis devices comprising at least: i) a high resolution microscope, ii) an image analyzer, and iii) an image recognition software, whereby these instruments and software compose an image analysis system, where the microscope produces an image of said smears and projects it into the image analyzer, where the image recognition software automatically compares said image with prerecorded data necessary for classification of images into negative/nonnegative/positive categories, and produces results of this comparison, and whereby, a composition of said automatic staining device and said image analysis system composes a workstation for performing said method steps from staining to evaluation, automatically and without human participation (robotic).
