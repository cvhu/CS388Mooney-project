An automated machine tool is provided and includes a frame having a first workpiece transfer station at a first location on the frame; at least two self-contained processing units, each of the units including structure for holding the workpiece for processing and structure for performing a process on the workpiece; and structure for sequentially indexing the processing units to the first workpiece transfer station for transferring workpieces to and from each of the processing units.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An automated machine tool comprising: a frame comprising a first workpiece transfer station at a first location on the frame and a second workpiece transfer station at a second location on the frame spaced from the first location; at least two self-contained processing units mounted on the frame for movement between the first and second workpiece transfer stations, each of the processing units capable of holding and performing a process on a workpiece; a workpiece transfer device mounted to the frame for movement between the first and second workpiece transfer stations to transfer workpieces to and from the processing units at the transfer stations; and an annular carrier mounted to the frame for rotation about an axis, the workpiece transfer device being mounted on the carrier for rotation about the axis with the carrier between the first and second workpiece transfer stations. 2. An automated machine tool comprising: a frame comprising a first workpiece transfer station at a first location on the frame and a second workpiece transfer station at a second location on the frame spaced from the first location; at least two self-contained processing units mounted to the frame for movement between the first and second workpiece transfer stations for the transfer of workpieces to and from each of the processing units; a workpiece transfer device mounted to the frame for movement between the first and second workpiece transfer stations to transfer workpieces to and from the processing units at the transfer stations; a splash guard mounted to the frame between the processing units and the workpiece transfer device; and a safety guard mounted to the frame such that the workpiece transfer device is positioned between the safety guard and the splash shield. 3. An automated machine tool comprising: a frame comprising a first workpiece transfer station at a first location on the frame; at least two self-contained processing units, each capable of holding and performing a process on a workpiece; a support mounted on the frame for rotation about an axis, said support carrying said processing units; a motor; a first tooth belt driven by the motor; and a second tooth belt affixed to the support and driveably engaged with the first tooth belt to rotate the support about the axis. 4. An automated machine tool comprising: a frame comprising a first workpiece transfer station at a first location on the frame; at least two self-contained processing units, each capable of holding and performing a process on a workpiece; a support mounted on the frame for rotation about an axis, said support carrying said processing units, the support being movable around the axis to sequentially move the processing units to the first workpiece transfer station for the transfer of workpieces to and from each of the processing units; and a first strip of hook and loop material on said support and a second strip of hook and loop material on at least one of said processing units, said first and second strips sandwiched between said support and said at least one of said processing units and releasably mounting the at least one processing unit on said support. 5. The machine tool of claim 4 wherein said first and second strips are made from Velcro.RTM. material.
