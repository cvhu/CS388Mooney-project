An automated peptide design and synthesis method is provided, wherein peptides are synthesized on interior, inward facing surfaces of reservoirs formed in a solvent resistant substrate. Novel substrates, as well as novel solutions for storing protected carboxyl terminal amino acids, are also provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A polyolefinic substrate which is solvent resistant and capable of forming --COOH groups upon oxidation with nitric acid, the substrate having one or more reservoirs therein, wherein each of said reservoirs opens on a single surface of said substrate, and wherein at least a portion of an interior, inward facing, surface of a reservoir therein has been activated for the anchoring of a protected carboxyl terminal amino acid thereto by reacting sequentially with (1) an acid capable of forming carboxyl groups on said interior surfaces of said reservoirs, (2) a carbonyldiimidazole, and (3) a polyamine. 2. The solvent resistant substrate of claim 1, wherein said substrate is in a microtiter format. 3. The solvent resistant substrate of claim 1, wherein the reservoir therein has been activated by reacting sequentially with (1) nitric acid at about 90-100.degree. C. for about two hours, (2) a carbonyldiimidazole, and (3) a polyamine. 4. The solvent resistant substrate of claim 1, wherein the carbonyldiimidazole is N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole. 5. The solvent resistant substrate of claim 1, wherein the polyamine is polyethyleneimine or polypropyleneimine. 6. The solvent resistant substrate of claim 1, wherein the substrate comprises polyethylene, polypropylene or a polyallomer. 7. The solvent resistant substrate of claim 1, wherein the substrate comprises polyethylene, polypropylene, polymethylpentene or a polyallomer.
