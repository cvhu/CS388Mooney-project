Disclosed is a combined pass through and load/unload system for automated data storage libraries. Separate portals open into each of the libraries. A pivoting robot supports a housing which is capable of supporting at least one removable multi-cartridge magazine, and pivots about a pivot axis. An actuator withdraws or extends the housing toward or away from the pivot axis. A pass through controller operates the pivoting robot to position the housing at a portal and operates the actuator to extend the housing into the portal so that the library may load and/or unload the data storage media into or out of the removable magazine(s) in the housing. The controller then operates the actuator and robot to withdraw the housing out of the portal. The controller may position the housing at the bulk load/unload position so an operator may unload and/or load magazines from the housing. The controller may position the housing at the portal of the other library to allow the transfer of media thereto. Each library may have a pass through controller and the other library may position and extend the housing into its portal, whereby the picker of the other library may unload the data storage media.

The pass through system of claim 2, additionally comprising a door sensor indicating that said lockable door has been closed, so that an operator upon completing a bulk load/unload may close said lockable door, said pass through controller responding to said door sensor to lock said lockable door. 4. The pass through system of claim 1, additionally comprising a position sensor coupled to said pass through controller, for indicating that said pivoting robot is properly positioned at each of said positions, said pass through controller operating said actuator to extend said housing only if said sensor indicates said pivot robot is correctly positioned at the position indicated by the command responded to by said pass through controller. 5. The pass through system of claim 1, for passing data storage media from one of said libraries to the other of said libraries, said pass through controller responding to a "library load/unload" command for one of said libraries to operate said pivoting robot to position said housing at said portal of said one library and operating said actuator to extend said housing away from said pivot axis into said portal, whereby said picker of said one library may load said data storage media into said at least one removable magazine in said housing, said pass through controller responding to a "library load/unload completed" command for said one library to operate said actuator to withdraw said housing out of said portal toward said pivot axis and to operate said pivoting robot to position said housing at said portal of said other library and operating said actuator to extend said housing away from said pivot axis into said portal of said other library, whereby said picker of said other library may unload said data storage media of said at least one removable magazine in said housing and may load other said data storage media into said at least one removable magazine, and said pass through controller responding to a "library load/unload completed" command for said other library to operate said actuator to withdraw said housing out of said portal toward said pivot axis. 6. An automated data storage system, comprising: a first automated data storage library, said library having at least one picker with at least one gripper and having a library controller for operating said at least one picker; a second automated data storage library, said library having at least one picker with at least one gripper and having a library controller for operating said at least one picker; a first portal opening into said first automated data storage library; a second portal opening into said second automated data storage library; and a pass through system located between said first portal and said second portal for transporting data storage media between said first and said second automated data storage libraries and for bulk loading data storage media into or out of said libraries, said pass through system including: a housing capable of supporting at least one removable magazine, each said removable magazine for holding a plurality of said data storage media; a pivoting robot supporting said at least one housing, said pivoting robot rotating about a pivot axis between a first position directed at said first portal, a second position directed at said second portal, and a bulk load/unload position between said first and said second positions; an actuator supported by said pivoting robot, said actuator withdrawing said housing toward said pivot axis and extending said housing away from said pivot axis; and a pass through controller operating said pivoting robot and said actuator, said pass through controller responding to a "library load/unload" command for one of said libraries to operate said pivoting robot to position said housing at said portal of said one library and operating said actuator to extend said housing away from said pivot axis into said portal, whereby said picker of said one library may load and/or unload said data storage media into or out of said at least one removable magazine in said housing under the control of said one library controller, said pass through controller responding to a "library load/unload completed" command from said one library controller to operate said actuator to withdraw said housing out of said portal toward said pivot axis. 7. The automated data storage system of claim 6, comprising a pass through controller for each of said automated data storage libraries, said one library pass through controller operating said pivoting robot and said actuator for "library load/unload" commands for said one library, said one library relinquishing control of said pivoting robot and said actuator upon a "library load/unload completed" command from said one library and upon the occurrence of a "library load/unload" command for the other of said libraries. 8. The automated data storage system of claim 7, additionally comprising a lockable door at said bulk load/unload position of said pass through system housing, and wherein said pass through controller of one of said libraries additionally responds to a "bulk load/unload command" for said one library to operate said pivoting robot to position said housing at said bulk load/unload position, and to unlock said door, whereby an operator may remove and replace said at least one removable magazine from said housing and/or said data storage media therefrom, and, said pass through controller, before positioning said housing at said bulk load/unload position for a bulk unload operation, or subsequent to positioning said housing at said bulk load/unload position for a bulk load operation, to operate said pivoting robot to position said housing at said portal of said one library and operating said actuator to extend said housing away from said pivot axis into said portal, whereby said picker of said one library may load and/or unload said data storage media into or out of said at least one removable magazine in said housing under the control of said library controller of said one library. 9.
