A method and apparatus for automatically milking animals such as cows which includes one or more milking compartments, each milking compartment having a milking robot including teat cups which are supported by a robot arm member. A detector that generates beams and uses their reflections for determining the position of the teats of an animal in a milking compartment is disposed on a robot arm construction spacially separated from the robot arm member. The robot arm construction is maneuverable up and down and side-to-side and is mounted so that its beams can scan the animal's teats from different directions. The milking robot is capable of connecting the teat cups to the animal's teats selectively simultaneously or non-simultaneously and automatically uncoupling the teat cups from the animal's teats either simultaneously or non-simultaneously.
Claims I claim: 1. A method of automatically milking an animal, such as a cow, using a milking robot which includes teat cups, the method comprising automatically and simultaneously coupling the teat cups to the animal and automatically decoupling said teat cups individually and non-simultaneously from the teats of the animal, whereby the teat cups are individually uncoupled. 2. A method of automatically milking an animal such as a cow, using a milking robot which includes teat cups, the method comprising automatically coupling teat cups non-simultaneously to the animal's teats and subsequently automatically decoupling said teat cups from the animal's teat simultaneously. 3. A method of automatically milking an animal such as a cow using a robot having four robotic arms each of which supports a teat cup which is connected thereto via an extendable flexible member, said robot further comprising a detector for locating the positions of the animal's teats, said detector being disposed on a robot arm construction spaced from said robotic arms, the method comprising the steps of: locating the positions of said animal's teats by moving said robot arm construction into the vicinity of said teats and detecting their positions by said detector; moving said robot arm construction with said detector disposed thereon so that said detector is spaced and separated from said robotic arms and the teat cups supported thereby, said robot arm construction together with said detector being omni-directionally moved in the vicinity of said teats while generating beams from said detector directed at different angles towards said teats and determining the positions of said teats from the reflections of said beams; automatically coupling said teat cups to the animal's corresponding said teats at their respective positions as determined by the reflections of said beams; withdrawing said robotic arms from said teat cups while maintaining a connection between said teat cups and their respective robotic arms by the extendable flexible members; and automatically uncoupling said teat cups from said teats and withdrawing said teat cups to their corresponding robotic arms by moving them thereto by said extendable flexible members as the milking of the animal is concluded. 4. A method in accordance with claim 3 wherein said step of coupling said teat cups to corresponding said teats is accomplished by said robotic arms substantially simultaneously and said step of uncoupling said teat cups from said teats by moving said teat cups to their corresponding robotic arms by said extendable flexible members is not accomplished simultaneously. 5. A method in accordance with claim 3, wherein the coupling of said teat cups to corresponding said teats by said robotic arms is not accomplished simultaneously and wherein the uncoupling of said teat cups from said teats by moving said teat cups to said robotic members by said extendable flexible members is accomplished substantially simultaneously. 6. A method of automatically milking an animal such as a cow, using a robot having four robotic arms each of which supports a teat cup and is connected thereto via an extendable flexible member, said robot further comprising a detector for locating the teats of the animal which is disposed on a robot arm construction spaced from said robotic arms, the method comprising the steps of: locating the positions of the teats of said animal by moving said robot arm construction into the vicinity of said teats and detecting their respective positions by said detector; moving the teat cups by said robotic arms to under their positions as determined by the detector; automatically and simultaneously coupling said teat cups to corresponding said teats; withdrawing said robotic arms from said teat cups while retaining connections between said teat cups and their respective said robotic arms by the extendable flexible members; and automatically uncoupling said teat cups non-simultaneously from said teats and withdrawing said teat cups to their corresponding said robotic arms by said extendable flexible members as a milking of said animal is concluded. 7. A method of automatically milking an animal such as a cow using a robot having four robotic arms each of which supports a teat cup and is connected thereto via an extendable flexible member, said robot further comprising a detector for locating the teats of the animal which is disposed on a robot arm construction spaced from said robotic arms, the method comprising the steps of: locating the positions of the teats of said animal by moving said robot arm construction in the vicinity of said teats and detecting their respective positions by said detector; moving the teat cups by said robotic arms to under their respective positions as determined by said detector; automatically and non-simultaneously coupling said teat cups to their corresponding said teats; withdrawing said robotic arms from said teat cups while retaining connections between said teat cups and their respective robotic arms by the extendable flexible members, and automatically uncoupling said teats cups simultaneously from said teats and withdrawing said teat cups to their corresponding robotic arms by said extendable flexible members as the milking of said animal is concluded. 8. An apparatus for automatically milking animals, such as cows comprising: a milking compartment, a milking robot including teat cups for being connected to an animal in said compartment, said teat cups being supported by a robot arm means; a detector that generates beams and uses their reflections for determining the positions of teats, said detector being disposed on a robot arm construction spacially separated from said robot arm means, said robot arm construction comprising omni-directing means for maneuvering said detector so that said detector's beams can be aimed at different angles with respect to the teats of the animal to be milked in said compartment, said omni-directing means comprising scanning means for performing a scanning motion in different directions, said milking robot comprising means for automatically connecting said teat cups to the teats of the animal selectively simultaneously or non-simultaneously and for automatically uncoupling said teat cups from the teats of the animal selectively simultaneously or non-simultaneously.
