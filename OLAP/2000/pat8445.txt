A fiber placement machine undergoes a plurality of axes of motion in locating a delivery head (containing a compaction roller) perpendicular to a mandrel, with relative movement between the head and the mandrel along a predetermined path, which may be over a complex compounded shape. The machine includes a temperature controlled creel where rovings (or tows) of fibrous material are stored on spools and are fed from the creel to the delivery head. The delivery head processes the tows into a band and applies the band on the surface of the mandrel by means of the roller compaction.
