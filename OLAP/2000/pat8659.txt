Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of PTEN. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding PTEN. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of PTEN expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of PTEN are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound 8 to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to the 3' UTR of a nucleic acid molecule encoding human PTEN, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human PTEN SEQ ID NO:1. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 45, 46, 47, 42 or 44. 4. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43 or 47. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 13. The composition of claim 12 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 14. The composition of claim 12 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 15. A method of inhibiting the expression of PTEN in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of PTEN is inhibited. 16. An antisense oligonucleotide up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human PTEN comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 20 and which inhibits the expression of human PTEN, SEQ ID NO: 1. 17. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 16 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide-comprises at least one modified internucleotide linkage. 18. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 17 wherein the internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 19. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 16 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 20. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 19 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 21. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 16 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 22. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 21 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 23. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 16 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 24. A composition comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 16 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 25. A method of inhibiting the expression of PTEN in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells of tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 16 that expression of PTEN is inhibited.
