A system for identifying and managing information stored in a plurality of physical volumes (e.g., tape cartridges) in an information storage system includes a plurality of labels. Each label is configured for physical attachment to a physical volume and includes an electromagnetic transponder for storing data associated with the physical volume and/or the information contained therein. The electromagnetic transponder is non-volatile, re-writable, and readable without requiring physical contact with the label. The system includes a robotic hand assembly for manipulating the physical volumes. Fine positioning of the robotic hand assembly with respect to the physical volume is done based on a signal returned from the electromagnetic transponder.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an automated physical volume system, a method for aligning a robotic hand assembly with a selected physical volume, the method comprising the steps of: coarsely positioning the robotic hand assembly adjacent the selected physical volume, wherein the selected physical volume includes an electromagnetic transponder having a non-volatile memory configured to store data associated with the selected physical volume, and wherein the robotic hand assembly includes transceiver means for electromagnetically reading said data from said transponder without requiring physical contact with the selected physical volume; transmitting an electromagnetic signal from said transceiver toward said electromagnetic transponder; receiving a return signal from said electromagnetic transponder at said transceiver; and adjusting the relative positioning of the robotic hand assembly and the selected physical volume based on said return signal from said electromagnetic transponder. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said step of adjusting further comprises the step of: adjusting the relative positioning of the robotic hand assembly and the selected physical volume to maximize a magnitude of said return signal received at said transceiver means.
