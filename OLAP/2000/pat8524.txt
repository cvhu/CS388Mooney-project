Compounds are provided which inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and thus are useful for lowering serum lipids and treating atherosclerosis and related diseases. The compounds have the structure ##STR1## wherein R.sup.1 to R.sup.7, Q, X and Y are as defined herein.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for preventing, inhibiting or treating atherosclerosis; pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia; hyperglycemia (1) by causing reduced absorption of dietary fat through MTP inhibition or (2) by lowering triglycerides through MTP inhibition of (3) by decreasing absorptiion of free fatty acids through MTP inhibition; or obesity secondary to malabsorption of dietary fat, or a method of lowering serum lipid levels, cholesterol and/or triglycerides, or preventing and/or treating hyperlipidemia, or hypercholesterolemia in a mammalian species, which comprises administering to a patient in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound which has the structure ##STR734## wherein R.sup.1 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, arylalkyl wherein alkyl has at least 2 carbons, heteroarylalkyl wherein alkyl has at least 2 carbons, cycloalkyl, or cycloalkylalkyl, all optionally substituted through available carbon atoms with 1, 2, or 3 groups selected from halo, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, aryl, arylalkyl, alkylmercapto, arylmercapto, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl; R.sup.5 and R.sup.6 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, all optionally substituted through available carbon atoms with 1, 2, or 3 groups selected from hydrogen, halo, alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, arylalkyl, aryloxy, heteroarylalkyl, alkylthio, arylthio; with the proviso that when R.sup.5 is CH.sub.3, R.sup.6 is not hydrogen; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. 2. The method as defined in claim 1 where the compound employed is N-[1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-benzamide; N-[1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-pentamide; 4-methoxy-.alpha.-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl]benz eneacetamide; N-[1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-methoxybenzamide; N-[1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-methylbenzamide; N-[1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-pyridinamide; N-1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-N-methyl-benzamide, and the monhydrochloride salts of each thereof.
