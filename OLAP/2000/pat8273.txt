The present invention relates to an assay apparatus for detecting a product in a sample. The assay apparatus comprises a fluid pathway with an input for the sample and an input for a reagent with a detectable moiety which transports the sample to a detecting means via a barrier arranged to prevent a product-reagent complex passage but allow passage to the reagent and the sample. The complex is formed through interaction of the reagent and any of the product in the sample. The apparatus also including supply means for supplying a substance adapted to breakdown the complex into a detectable moiety which can flow through the barrier to the detecting means.
Claims We claim: 1. An assay apparatus for detecting an analyte of interest in a fluid sample, the apparatus comprising a fluid pathway including: a first input, for introducing the sample into the fluid pathway; a second input, for introducing one or more reagents and microbeads having one or more ligand binders thereon into the fluid pathway, each reagent including a label and being an analogue of the analyte of interest or having specificity for the analyte of interest, and each ligand binder having specificity for the analyte of interest; a mixing coil downstream from the first and second inputs, wherein the sample, the one or more reagents and the microbeads are mixed, and one or more of reagent complexes, analyte complexes or reagent/analyte complexes are formed on the microbeads; a third input for introducing eluting substances into the fluid pathway; valve means downstream from the mixing coil operably connected to one or more incubation loops, wherein the valve means allows fluid to be diverted from the fluid pathway into an incubation loop for a period of isolation, and then to be returned to the fluid pathway; a barrier section downstream from the third input and the valve means, the barrier section including a barrier configured to retain the microbeads and any complexes thereon, while allowing passage of any unbound sample and reagent, and to retain the microbeads and any complexes or partial complexes thereon, while allowing passage of any unbound label, the partial complexes and unbound label being obtained when an eluting substance is introduced into the fluid pathway; a detecting means downstream from the barrier, for detecting the unbound label; and an outlet, downstream from the detecting means. 2.
