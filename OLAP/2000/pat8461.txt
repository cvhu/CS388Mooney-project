A method for making the alignment means of an optical apparatus. The apparatus comprising a substrate defining one or more aligned cavities, a primary optical path for accommodating the passage of a light beam, and an upper cavity in the substrate which is aligned to a predetermined degree of precision and in direct communication with the primary optical path. The beam steering means directs the beam. The hybrid inter-optical alignment precision occurring when a beam steering mechanism is micromachined with respect to a crystallographic orientation of the substrate is used for precise beam steering.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for making an alignment means for aligning an optical element within a cavity comprising the steps of: providing a sacrificial pad disposed on a lower surface of said substrate for delineating the approximate extent of the lower most dimensions of said lower cavity; providing an etch resistant film disposed over said sacrificial pad and said lower surface of said substrate; providing a hole through said etch resistant film, substantially centered on said sacrificial pad, said hole having lateral dimensions substantially equivalent to a cross section of said optical element; removing said sacrificial pad and subsequently etching said lower cavity, such that a rim of said etch resistant film substantially confines said optical element inserted therein.
