An apparatus for selecting individual packages from an accumulated package line, which measures one common dimension of a plurality of packages, combines the packages together in line contract, establishes an "actual line error" by comparing the actual overall length of the line to a theoretical length, and assigns portions of this actual line error to different packages in the line, depending on their location in the line.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for selecting individual packages from an accumulated package line comprised of plurality of packages in line contact along their lengths, said accumulated package line including at its opposing ends first and second end packages defining corresponding first and second outwardly opposing surfaces, the actual distance between said outwardly opposing surfaces defining said overall actual length of said accumulated package line, said accumulated package line also including at least one intermediate package located between said end packages, said apparatus comprising: a) means for determining one common dimension of a plurality of packages as a "nominal length" of each of said packages; b) means for accumulating said accumulated package line as a plurality of packages in line contact such that said common dimensions of said packages combine to comprise the actual line length of said accumulated package line; c) means for measuring the actual line length of said accumulated package line by measuring the distance between said first and second outwardly opposing surfaces; d) means for determining the difference between said actual accumulated package line length and the summation of the nominal line lengths of all the packages in the line as "actual line error"; e) means for assigning a portion of said actual line error to said intermediate package within said line; f) gripper means for picking up said intermediate package; and g) gripper control means for instructing a gripper to move to pick up said intermediate package, said gripper control means instructions at least partially responsive to said nominal length measurements and said portion of said actual line error assigned to said intermediate package. 2. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a reference stop surface and wherein said the measurement of said actual line length of said accumulated package line is done by urging said first opposing surface of said first package against said reference stop surface of known location and by measuring the distance of said second opposing surface of said second package relative to said reference stop surface. 3. The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the portion of said actual line error assigned to said intermediate package is directly dependent upon the number of packages between said reference stop surface and said intermediate package. 4. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said apparatus manipulates an accumulated package line having said intermediate package in direct contact with at least one of said end packages. 5. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said apparatus manipulates an accumulated package line having said intermediate package not being in direct contact with either of said end packages, instead having at least one package between the intermediate package and each of the end packages. 6. A method for selecting individual packages from an accumulated package line comprised of plurality of packages in line contact along their lengths, said accumulated package line including at its opposing ends first and second end packages defining corresponding first and second outwardly opposing surfaces, the actual distance between said outwardly opposing surfaces defining said overall actual length of said accumulated package line, said accumulated package line also including at least one intermediate package located between said end packages, said method comprising the steps of: a) determining one common dimension of a plurality of packages as a "nominal length" of each of said packages; b) subsequent to step "a", accumulating said accumulated package line as a plurality of packages in side-justified line contact such that said common dimensions of said packages combine to comprise the actual line length of said accumulated package line; c) measuring the actual line length of said accumulated package line by measuring the distance between said first and second outwardly opposing surfaces; d) determining the difference between said actual accumulated package line length and the summation of the nominal line lengths of all the packages in the line as "actual line error"; e) assigning a portion of said actual line error to said intermediate package within said line; f) instructing a gripper to move to pick up said intermediate package, said instructions at least partially dependent upon based on said nominal length measurements and said portion of said actual line error assigned to said intermediate package; g) accumulating another package to create a modified accumulated package line; h) measuring the actual line length of said modified accumulated package line; i) determining the difference between said actual modified accumulated package line length and the summation of the nominal line lengths of all the packages in the modified accumulated package line as a second "actual line error"; j) determining a weighted actual line error dependent upon said original actual line error determined in step "d" and said second actual line error determined in step "i"; and k) instructing a gripper to move to pick up another intermediate package, said instructions at least partially dependent upon based on said nominal length measurements and said portion of said weighted actual line error assigned to said intermediate package.
