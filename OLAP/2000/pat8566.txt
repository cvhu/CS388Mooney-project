A six degree of freedom structure forming a robotic manipulator, consisting of two five-bar linkages (30 and 80) set on rotatable base linkages (18 and 58); the output points (44 and 94) of the five-bar linkages (30 and 80) are attached to a rigid payload platform (48) by universal joints (46 and 96), respectively. Each linkage (30 and 80) on its rotatable bass can position its output point in three degrees of freedom, but since the two five-bar linkages (30 and 80) are tied together at the platform (48), five degree of freedom motion of the platform (48) results--three degrees of freedom in translation, and two of rotation. A seventh motor (100), mounted for example on one of the five bar linkages, provides power to rotate the platform about the axis defined by the two universal joints (46 and 96). The rotational torque is coupled through one of the universal joints (46 or 96).
Claims We claim: 1. A manipulator comprising of a pair of symmetrical 5 bar linkages, each said linkages having a waist link, a pair of proximal links each mounted on said waist link in spaced relationship for movement around spaced parallel axes each extending substantially perpendicular to said waist link, each of said proximal links having a motor for moving its proximal link about its axis of said pair of parallel axes, a pair of distal links one pivotably connected to each of said proximal links on its pivotal axis which is substantially parallel to said pair of axes and a pivotal connection interconnecting an end of each said distal links remote from said proximal links, a platform, a pair of universal joint type connectors connecting a pair of opposite sides of said platform with its adjacent free end of it adjacent said pair of 5 bar linkages, and a drive motor means driving at least one of said waist links for rotation about its longitudinal axis and a platform motor for driving one of said universal joint connectors. 2. The manipulator as defined in claim 1 wherein said drive motor means comprises a pair of motors one for driving each of said waist links.
