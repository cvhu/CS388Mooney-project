Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of SRC-3. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding SRC-3. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of SRC-3 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of SRC-3 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human SRC-3, wherein said antisense compound specifically hybridizes with and inhibits the expression of human SRC-3 and wherein said antisense compound has a sequence comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 10, 12, 17, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 47, 49, 18, 20, 22, 30, 34, or 38. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. The composition of claim 10 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 13. A method of inhibiting the expression of SRC-3 in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of SRC-3 is inhibited.
