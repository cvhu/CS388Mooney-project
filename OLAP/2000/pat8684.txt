The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antitense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 10. The antisense compound of claim 9 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 11. The antisense compound of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 12. A composition comprising the antisense compound of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 13. The composition of claim 12 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 14. The composition of claim 12 wherein the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. 15. A method of inhibiting the expression of Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-1 in human cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-1 is inhibited. 16. An antisense oligonucleotide up to 30 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding human Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-1 comprising at least an 8 nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 8, 16, or 22 and which inhibits expression of human Jun N-terminal Kinase Kinase-1. 17.
