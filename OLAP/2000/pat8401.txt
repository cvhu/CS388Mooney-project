A robotic device is provided for moving a shift lever of a vehicle including a shift actuator device drivingly connected to an elongated shift arm which is connected to a bracket assembly which is adapted to be mounted to a shift lever. The shift arm has a longitudinally extending elongated slot which is adjustably engaged by the shift actuator device.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic device for moving a shift lever of a vehicle, comprising: a shift actuator device adapted to be mounted in a seat of the vehicle; an elongated shift arm having a longitudinally extending elongated slot, said shift actuator adjustably engaging said elongated slot of said shift arm; and a bracket mechanism connected to said elongated shift arm and adapted to be attached to a shift lever. 2. A robotic device for moving a shift lever of a vehicle comprising: a shift actuator device; an elongated shift arm having a longitudinally extending elongated slot, said shift actuator adjustably engaging said elongated slot of said shift arm; and a bracket mechanism connected to said elongated shift arm and adapted to be attached to a shift lever. wherein said bracket mechanism includes a U-shaped bracket having a base portion attached to an end of said shift arm by a threaded fastener and a pair of arm portions pivotally supporting an adapter plate therebetween, said adapter plate being attached to a shift lever bracket adapted to be mounted to a shift lever of a vehicle. 3. The device according to claim 1, further comprising a thumb screw for adjustably connecting said shift arm said shift actuator device.
