A method and apparatus for exhausting gases out of multiple processing regions is provided and generally comprises first and second pumping channels disposed in first and second processing regions and connected to a pump via a common exhaust port.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An exhaust system for a tandem chamber set, comprising: (a) a monolithic chamber body comprising a first processing region and a second processing region that define a common chamber wall interposed between the processing regions; (b) a first pumping channel formed in the monolithic chamber body and disposed about the first processing region; (c) a second pumping channel formed in the monolithic chamber body and disposed about the second processing region; (d) a common exhaust channel simultaneously communicating with both the first and the second pumping channels to allow a substantially equal pressure in each of the first and second processing regions; and (e) a pair of conduits formed in the common chamber wall and coupling the common exhaust channel and the first and second pumping channels.
