The pass thru mechanism for automated cartridge library systems serves to interconnect two juxtaposed operationally independent automated cartridge library systems and provides a simple apparatus that makes use of gravity to obviate the need for complex mechanical mechanisms to pass the media cartridge between the juxtaposed automated cartridge library systems. In particular, the pass thru mechanism comprises a media cartridge receiver that accepts a media cartridge from an automated cartridge library robot and then deposits the media cartridge in a media cartridge positioning mechanism. The media cartridge positioning mechanism uses gravity to tumble the media cartridge down a ramp into a media cartridge transport that delivers the media cartridge to the robot located in the juxtaposed media cartridge receiving automated cartridge library system. The media cartridge positioning mechanism operates to reorient the media cartridge from a horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation while concurrently turning the media cartridge as it tumbles through its path to present the label end of the media cartridge to the robot that is located in the media cartridge receiving automated cartridge library system.
