Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of Smad7. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding Smad7. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of Smad7 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of Smad7 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. The An antisense compound up to 30 nucleobases in length comprising at least an 8-nucleobase portion of SEQ ID NO: 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 24, 25, 30, 33, 35, 38, 40, 11, 18, 20, 22, 27, 31, 36, 37, 39, 41 or 42 which inhibits the expression of human Smad7. 2. The antisense compound of claim 1 which is an antisense oligonucleotide. 3. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense compound of claim 3 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense compound of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense compound of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense compound of claim 2 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A method of inhibiting the expression of human Smad7 in human cells or tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense compound of claim 1 so that expression of human Smad7 is inhibited.
