A traverse carriage is vertically movably mounted on the Y-axis bearing way and a motor mount is provided on the traverse carriage for movement therewith. The traverse carriage has an X-axis bearing block provided thereon which movably supports an elongated and substantially horizontally disposed X-axis support. The X-axis support has an elongated, flat X-axis drive belt provided thereon positioned between the ends thereof. A drive motor is mounted on the motor mount and has a driven shaft extending horizontally therefrom which is operatively received by a differential drive means. The differential drive means includes an X-axis drive pulley and a Y-axis drive pulley. A Y-axis brake is provided for selective engagement with the Y-axis drive pulley for selectively preventing rotation of the Y-axis drive pulley. An X-axis brake is provided for selective engagement with the X-axis drive pulley for selectively preventing rotation of the X-axis drive pulley.
