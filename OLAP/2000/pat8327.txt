A substrate processing system that includes a deposition chamber having a reaction zone, a plasma power source for forming a plasma within the reaction zone and an impedance tuner electrically coupled to the deposition chamber. When initially formed, the plasma has a first impedance level that can be adjusted by the impedance tuner to a second impedance level. In a preferred embodiment, the impedance tuner is a variable capacitor.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for depositing a film on a substrate in a substrate processing chamber, said method comprising: introducing one or more process gases into a reaction zone of the substrate processing chamber; applying RF power to an electrode to form a plasma having a first impedance level from said one or more process gases in the reaction zone; tuning an RF matching network electrically coupled to the substrate processing chamber to the impedance of said plasma; and using an impedance tuner separate from said RF matching network and being electrically coupled to the processing chamber to adjust the impedance of said plasma. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said impedance tuner comprises a variable capacitor and wherein adjusting the impedance of the plasma includes changing the capacitance of said variable capacitor. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said RF power is applied to an electrode embedded within a substrate holder and said impedance tuner is electrically coupled between said electrode and a low frequency RF power source.
