A hue compass has triplet numerical values assigned to colors so that every possible color is identified with a unique triplet color identification number which represents the percentages of each primary color component present. Triplet values 100/0/0, 0/100/0, and 0/0/100 can be assigned to additive primaries blue-violet, green, and red, respectively. Their complementary colors yellow, magenta, and cyan can be assigned triplets 0/100/100, 100/0/100, and 100/100/0. Likewise, triplet values 100/0/0, 0/100/0 and 0/0/100 can be assigned to subtractive primaries yellow, magenta, and cyan, respectively. Their complementary colors, blueviolet, green, and red can be assigned 0/100/100, 100/0/100, and 100/100/0. A color robot can be employed to assign a triplet value for a given colored test object, whose color can be matched, e.g. by blending appropriate amounts of respective primary color pigments or dyes whose triplet color identification numbers are known.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of constructing a hue compass for objectively identifying any particular color with regard to its primary color content that includes the steps of locating a sequence of spaced color sites about the rim of a hue compass; positioning three primary colors at sites located about said disk compass which are at 120 degree intervals; locating respective secondary color sites for colors that are complements of said primary colors at stations diametrically opposite the associated said complementary primary color sites whereby each said secondary color site is situated midway between the remaining two primary color sites on the rim; assigning a triplet color identification number to each primary and secondary color site identifying relating to its percentage primary color content so that said first primary color site is identified 100/0/0, said second primary color is identified 0/100/0, and said third primary color site is identified 0/0/100 and the triplet sum of a primary color site identification number and its complementary secondary color site triplet identification number always equals 100/100/100; locating tertiary colors at sites equidistant between said primary color sites and the neighboring secondary color sites on the rim and assigning each tertiary color site a triplet color identification number that is an average of the adjacent primary and secondary color site triplet identification numbers whereby the sum of any two triplet identification numbers relating to color sites that are situated opposite each other on the rim of the compass equals 100/100/100. 2. The method of claim 1 that includes the step of further subdividing the circle between each tertiary color site and the neighboring primary or secondary color sites into spaced sites, each site representing an intermediate hue that is an admixture of the two colors adjacent and equidistant thereto and assigning a triplet color identification number to each said intermediate color that is an average of the color identification numbers of its adjacent color sites. 3. The method of claim 2 that includes the further step of joining opposed color sites positioned about the circle with diametrically aligned sets of color tone sites so that all such sets commonly share a center neutral site at the center of the hue compass, identifying the center neutral site with a triplet identification number 50/50/50 which represents medium neutral gray, and assigning a triplet color identification number to each color tone site in each color tone site that is an average of the triplet identification numbers of adjacent sites in said diametrically aligned set. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein for subtractive color synthesis the first primary color is yellow, the second primary color is magenta and the third primary color is cyan. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein for additive color synthesis the first primary color is blueviolet, the second primary color is green, and the third primary color is red. 6. A color chart for identifying a particular color with regard to its primary color content and which comprises a disk having a sequence of spaced color sites situated about its rim, with three primary color sites representing the three primary colors at 120 degree intervals about the rim, respective secondary color sites representing colors that are complements of said primary colors at sites diametrically opposite the associated complementary primary color sites whereby each said secondary color site is situated midway between the remaining two primary color sites on the rim, and tertiary color sites equidistant between said primary color sites and the neighboring secondary color sites on the rim of the disk between each tertiary color site and the neighboring primary or secondary sites each said further color site representing an intermediate hue that is an admixture of the two colors represented at sites adjacent and equidistant thereto; said primary, secondary, tertiary, and further color sites bearing a triplet color identification number relating to its percentage of primary color content so that the first, second, and third of the primary color sites are identified 100/0/0, 0/100/0 and 0/0/100, the first, second, and third of the complementary, secondary color sites have triplet identification numbers 0/100/100, 100/0/100, and 100/100/0, so that the triplet sum of any primary color site identification number and its complementary secondary color site identification number is always 100/100/100; said tertiary color sites each have a triplet color identification number that is an average of the adjacent primary and secondary color site triplet identification numbers whereby the sum of any two triplet identification numbers relating to the color sites that are situated diametrically opposite each other on the rim of the disk equals 100/100/100; and each said further color site has a triplet color identification number that is an average of the triplet color identification numbers of its equidistant adjacent color sites. 7. The color chart of claim 6 further including diametrically aligned sets of color tone sites that join diametrically opposed color sites on the rim of the disk, such that all such sets commonly share a neutral site at the center of the color chart, said neutral site bearing a triplet color identification number 50/50/50 to represent neutral gray, said color tone sites having triplet identification number that is an average of the triplet identification numbers of the equidistant tone sites adjacent thereto in said diametrically aligned set. 8. A color identification apparatus for automatically sensing the primary color components of an object and assigning triplet color identification numbers to uniquely identify the objects color in terms of the percentage value of each primary components wherein 100 represents full saturation of the components and 0 represents an absence of that component, with the triplet color identification numbers 100/0/0, 0/100/0, and 0/0/100 representing the primary components, and with 0/100/100, 100/0/100, and 100/100/0 representing respective complementary components, such that the triplet sum of any primary components and its complementary components, equals 100/100/100; and wherein other colors that are composed of one, two, or all three components are represented by triplets, N.sub.1 /N.sub.2 /N.sub.3 where N.sub.1, N.sub.2, and N.sub.3 are percentage values between 0% and 100%, whereby a neutral gray color value has the triplet number 50/50/50; the apparatus comprising: a source of white light illumination impingent upon said object; a color robot having first, second, and third primary color filters which are selectively interposed between the illuminated object and a sensor device in the color robot, and including means for providing an output value for each said primary color that is a percentage of the primary color light absorbed by the object; and a digital processing device which receives the output values from said color robot and computes the respective triplet color identification number therefor. 9.
