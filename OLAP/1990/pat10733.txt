The present invention relates to a wire harness retainer stud adhesively bonded to an automobile body panel. This stud is used to mount a wire harness to automobile body panels. The stud contains a contact adhesive and an uncured adhesive. The contact adhesive is used to mount the stud to the body panel until the stud and panel are heated to cure the uncured adhesive, thereby bonding the stud to the panel. A method of, and apparatus for, automated assembly of the stud is also disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of attaching a retainer stud to a panel using automation equipment, the retainer stud having a circular flat plate having a shaft face and a seal face, the faces parallel to one another, a shaft disposed upon the shaft face of the plate having clip engaging means for communicating with a retainer clip, a resilient annular seal having a plate surface and an adhesive surface, the surfaces parallel to one another, the plate surface attached to the seal face of the plate, the annular seal having a central cavity, a contact adhesive coating on the adhesive surface of the seal for mounting the retainer stud on the panel, an uncured adhesive in the central cavity of the seal which when cured will bond the retainer stud to the panel, the retainer stud attached to a backing wafer, said method comprising the steps of: feeding the retainer stud having a backing wafer to the automation equipment; gripping the shaft of the retainer stud with a robot arm of the automation equipment; removing the backing wafer from the retainer stud by movement of the robot arm; moving the retainer stud by the robot arm of the automation equipment to a location remote from where the backing wafer was removed; pressing the retainer stud and seal having contact adhesive and uncured adhesive onto the panel to compress the seal, causing the contact adhesive and uncured adhesive to contact the panel, and temporarily adhering the retainer stud to the panel by the contact adhesive on the seal; and heating the retainer stud and the panel in an automobile paint drying oven to cure the uncured adhesive and bonding the retainer stud to the panel.
