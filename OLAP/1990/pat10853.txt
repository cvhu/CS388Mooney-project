An advanced parallel seam-sealing system which includes a control console, computer deck, electronic keyboard and welding robot for automatically sealing electronic and other component packages. The welding robot is designed to have seven (7) degrees of motion. Parallel arms having roller electrodes move independent of each other in horizontal and rotational directions to continuously operate on a package or matrix of packages which are supported on a rotary table that has vertical, longitudinal and rotary motion. Six of the motions are driven through computer programmed commands and the vertical rotary table motion is electromechanically controlled and represents the seventh degree of motion. The multiple degrees of freedom allow the system to be used for sealing of multiple arrays of packages by this parallel seam-sealing technique, in a reliable, precise and fast operation.
