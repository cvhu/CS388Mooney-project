A robotic assembly system for the automatic assembly of a complex article such as a CRT display unit has a number of workstations positioned along an open conveyor system at each of which as assembly operation is performed by a conventional stand-alone robot. Each workstation is provided with a basic lift mechanism (36, 17, 21, 24, 28) which when operated lifts a pallet (4) supplied thereto from the relatively imprecise surface of the conveyor (1) into a predetermined horizontal plane above the conveyor where it is accurately located. A stand-alone robot, programmed to operate with reference to this constant datum position performs the assembly operation associated with that workstation. In order to assist the assembly operation, an air bearing table (17) is incorporated in the lift mechanism to provide the pallet, and any article carried by the pallet, with lateral compliance while held at the datum position. On completion of the assembly operation, the lift mechanism is retracted, lowering the pallet back onto the conveyor for transportation to the next workstation. The invention is particularly suited for assembly operations involving the handling of potentially hazardous components such as, for example, CRTs during the assembly of a display motor. A modification to the basic lift mechanism enables the assembly of a CRT into its surrounding bezel to be performed. The modification includes the addition of a further lift device (35, 38) which, when operated, lifts a platform (30) through an aperture (34) in the pallet into a second predetermined horizontal plane. To perform the assembly operation, a pallet (4) already supporting a part-cabinet (8) including its bezel surround (9) as a result of a previous assembly operation, is raised into the first datum position. The platform is then raised into the second datum position above the first. A stand-alone robot, programmed to operate with reference to the second datum places and releases a CRT face-plate down on the platform. The platform is then lowered back through the aperture in the pallet leaving the CRT supported in the bezel surround. The pallet is finally lowered onto the conveyor for transportation to the next workstation.
Claims Having thus described our invention, what we claim as new and desire to secure as Letters Patent is as follows: 1. A robotic assembly system in which pallets, on each of which an article is to be assembled, are transported by a conveyor from one workstation to the next, at each of which an assembly operation is to be performed by a robot, characterized in that at each workstation means are provided for stopping and coarsely positioning a pallet supplied thereto, and each said workstation includes a linear lift mechanism operable to engage and lift a pallet coarsely positioned thereat from the conveyor, along an axis, into a precisely located vertical position, said lift mechanism including compliant means operable to provide said pallet with lateral compliance in all directions within a plane which is substantially normal to said axis while supported by said mechanism in said vertical position, the system further including means at the workstation to cause said lift mechanism to lift and support the pallet in said vertical position for a subsequent assembly operation performed by a robot, the pre-programmed operating characteristics of which have been determined with reference to said vertical position of the pallet, and upon completion of the assembly operation to lower the pallet onto the conveyor for transportation out of the workstation. 2. A robotic assembly system as claimed in claim 1, in which said compliant means comprises an air bearing table structure having a lower base member and an upper table, said upper cable being supported in operation by air bearings located between the base member and the table. 3. A robotic assembly system as claimed in claim 2, in which said lift mechanism further includes a base support structure, a lifting device connected between said support structure and said base member of said air bearing table structure, operable to raise the air bearing structure to an upper position or to lower it to a lower position, and locating means of extending upwardly from the air bearing table which, when the table is in its lower position, is entirely below the plane of the conveyor at its associated workstation, but, when the table is in its upper position, extends beyond the plane of the conveyor surface, the construction and arrangement of said upwardly extending locating means being such that on raising from the lower to upper position it cooperatively engages with associated features on a pallet, coarsely positioned at said workstation, and lifts the pallet from the conveyor supported on said locating means, said precisely located vertical position to which the pallet is raised being defined by the upper position to which the air bearing table structure is raised. 4. A robotic assembly system as claimed in claim 3, in which said locating means comprises four vertical pins of equal length disposed in rectangular configuration, each having its upper end tapered to a conical point, each pallet being provided on its underside with four correspondingly positioned mating apertures, the size of the apertures being sufficient to accommodate the positional tolerances of a pallet coarsely positioned at the workstation thereby to ensure that, on raising the air-bearing table, the points of the locating pins will always enter the mating apertures. 5. A robotic assembly system as claimed in claim 4, adapted to assemble a CRT into its bezel surround, said bezel surround being carried face down on a pallet previously supplied along the conveyor to the workstation, the adaption including providing said lifting mechanism with a second lifting device operable to raise and lower a platform through an appropriately sized aperture in said pallet, its arrangement being such that when in its lowest position, the platform lies entirely below the plane of the conveyor surface and when at its highest position the platform is at a second precisely located vertical position above said first vertical position, said platform being provided with CRT receiving means for stably supporting a CRT placed face-plate down thereon and the dimensions of the platform being such that no portion of the platform extends laterally beyond the bounds of the face-plate of a CRT supported thereon, said control means being further operable in response to detection of said platform at the second vertical position to cause a robot, the pre-programmed operating characteristics of which have been determined with reference to said second vertical position, to place and release a CRT face-plate down on said CRT receiving means; further in response to detection of a CRT on said CRT receiving means and detection of said pallet at the first vertical position to retract the second lifting device to lower the CRT into the bezel surround supported at the first vertical position; and further, following full retraction of said second lifting device, to retract said first lifting device to lower the pallet carrying the bezel and CRT onto the conveyor for transportation out of the workstation. 6. A robotic assembly system as claimed in claim 5, in which the second lifting device is mounted on said lower base member of said air bearing table structure and extends upwardly through apertures in said air bearing table of sufficient magnitude not to impede the lateral compliance of said air bearing table. 7. A robotic assembly system as claimed in claim 5 or 6, in which said CRT receiving means comprises four identical resilient domes disposed in rectangular configuration on said platform. 8. A method for the automatic assembly of a CRT display unit includes the steps of: transporting a CRT bezel surround (or cabinet) face down along a conveyor system and stopping the bezel surround at an assembly station; at the assembly station, raising along an axis a first structure having lateral compliance in all directions within a plane which is substantially normal to said axis to lift a bezel positioned thereat into a first predetermined plane substantially normal to said axis; raising a second structure through the aperture defined by a CRT bezel located on said first structure into a second predetermined plane substantially normal to the said axis and located above the first plane; causing a robotic device to place and release a CRT tube face-plate down in a predetermined position supported on the raised second structure; lowering the second structure relative to the first structure in order to insert the CRT tube into the bezel surround; and lowering the first and second structure to replace the CRT bezel surround with CRT located therein onto the conveyor for transportation by the conveyor out of the assembly station.
