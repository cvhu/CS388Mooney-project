A robot manipulator uses multiple robot arms to grasp and move an object. The object is moved by the coordinated motion of the arms. Because of inaccuracies in the coordinated motion of the arms due to mechanical inaccuracies or to imperfections in the model used by the controller to evaluate the interaction of the arms with the environment, the actual motion of the arms may be slightly uncoordinated. This may result in the application of unwanted forces to the object which may distort or break the object, the arms, or both. A multiarm accommodation arrangement evaluates the forces applied by the arms to the object to determine the net forces, and generates position accommodation signals which are summed with the several mutually coordinated arm control signals to tend to cause the forces applied to the object to be zero or a desired finite value. In a particular embodiment of the invention, an outer loop provides position accommodation to control forces applied by the object to an external load.
