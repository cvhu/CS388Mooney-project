A horn type microwave antenna includes a main reflector and sub-reflector that are supported in proper spaced relationship by flexidigit robotic manipulators, multisection arms that are capable of positional changes, whereby the supports may be changed in position responsive to the application of control voltages. At least a portion of the manipulators include piezo electric actuators, permitting rapid adjustment of the reflectors' position.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In combination with a satellite, said satellite containing therewithin an RF receiver for receiving control signals from a remote source and having a wall defining an exterior boundary to said satellite, microwave horn means forming a microwave transmission passage through said wall; main reflector means for reflecting incident microwave energy; sub-reflector means for reflecting incident microwave energy; first elongated support means for supporting said main reflector means to said wall in spaced relationship to said sub reflector means and said horn means; second elongated support means for supporting said sub reflector means to said wall in spaced relation to said horn means and said main reflector means, said sub reflector means being positioned to reflect microwave energy between said main reflector mean and said horn means; the improvement wherein at least one of said first and second support means comprises: a flexidigit robotic manipulator for positioning a reflector means, said flexidigit robotic manipulator comprising: a multidigit arm, said arm containing a plurality of at least two sections including: a first course manipulator section and a second fine manipulator section, and with said fine manipulator section being coupled to and carried by said course manipulator section, each of which sections is positionable angularly and spatially to a predetermined degree with respect to an adjacent section, and said arm being capable of forming a plurality of curves to position an end thereof at selected locations, whereby said support means is changeable in position; and wherein said course manipulator section comprises further: a series of at least two platform means; said platform means being spaced apart with one of said platform means including means for holding said fine manipulator section and with each of said platform means having an axis; position control means for bearing the axial and torsional loads imposed on said platforms and positioning each of said platforms in said series relative to one another, said position control means comprising: stabilizer means disposed between adjacent ones of said platform means in said series of platform means, each said stabilizer means further comprising: at least three arm assemblies located spaced essentially evenly about the center of said platform means; each of said arm assemblies including further: a pair of arms, joint means and a pair of anchor means; each arm in said pair of arms being joined together at one end by said joint means to form an articulated arm with said joint means permitting universal movement between said arms of said arm pair and with the remaining ends of each arm in said pair being movably attached to respective adjacent ones of said platform means by a corresponding one of said associated pair of anchor means with each said anchor means being adapted to permit the associated pair of arms to rotate in a plane generally normal to the surface of said adjacent ones of said platform means; and actuator means spaced from said stabilizer means and being disposed between adjacent ones of said platform means in said series to platform means for moving a platform means relative to an adjacent platform means; said actuator means being capable of sustaining a longitudinally directed force applied by mechanical loading and being incapable of resisting rotational movement of one of said platform means relative to the adjacent one of said platform means applied by said mechanical loading; whereby axially directed forces and torsional forces applied to said position control means are separately selectively absorbed, respectively, by said actuator means and by said stabilizer means. 2. The invention as defined in claim 1 wherein said fine manipulator section further comprises: a plurality of disks arranged in serial order adjacent one another to form a support for a reflector means and with each pair of adjacent disks defining a region therebetween; each of said regions including a plurality of three actuators evenly spaced about the periphery of adjacent disks and being coupled thereto, said actuators each comprising a piezoelectric means responsive to a selected levels of voltage applied thereto for providing a corresponding changes in the length thereof, whereby corresponding locations on adjacent disks may be varied; and control voltage means for selectively applying voltages to said actuator means, whereby the attitude and orientation of said reflector means may be changed.
