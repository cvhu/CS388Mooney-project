A robotic case packing system arranges a row of articles entering on a conveyor into an arrangement corresponding to the arrangement of articles to be packaged, where an end effector of a robotic arm engages the individual articles and lifts them for placement into waiting cases. The end effector of a first embodiment includes opposed pairs of stationary and pivoting gripper elements for engaging each of the articles. The pivoting gripper elements are provided through the action of cylinders operating through a linkage connected to a lever for rotating a cam shaft on which is mounted a cam for engaging a cam follower on the pivoting gripper element. A second embodiment includes suction cups for engaging smooth tops of articles. To ensure that the cases to be packed are square and that the flaps are open, a box squaring mechanism engages and squares the cases, while the robotic arm is controlled to use the engaged articles to push the flaps of the cases to an open position using a zig-zag motion before inserting the articles.
