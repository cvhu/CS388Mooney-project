The field of the present invention is that of an apparatus and method of installing weather stripping in a door and like openings using a robot. The field of the present invention is also that of an end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot which installs weather stripping in a door and like openings.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. An end of arm tool (EOAT) for a robot used for installing a loop of weather stripping into a body opening, said EOAT in combination comprising: a frame; fork means having two fingers mounted to said frame for laterally surrounding and bracketing said weather strip; a guide roller rotatably mounted to said frame, said guide roller having a first position for engagement with said loop to align said weather stripping and said guide roller having a second position for nonengagement with said loop; an idler roller receiving said loop from said fork means mounted on said frame for supporting said loop generally opposite said guide roller in said first position of said guide roller; and a pressure roller rotatively mounted on said frame for receiving said loop from said guide roller and guiding said loop and tracing the opening of said body whereby said loop is affixed to the opening of said body. 2. An EOAT as described in claim 1 wherein said fingers are tapered with a portion of said fingers most adjacent to said frame being closer together to each other than a portion of said fingers furthest away from said frame. 3. An EOAT for a robot used for installing a loop of weather stripping into a body opening, the weather stripping having a U-shaped carrier with interior barbs nd inboard and an outboard legs, both of said legs having outer surfaces, said EOAT in combination comprising: a frame; a guide roller rotatably mounted to said frame, said guide roller having a first position for engagement with said loop to align said weather stripping and said guide roller having a second position for nonengagement with said loop, said guide roller having a major transverse dimension for projection within said carrier with a taper on both sides of said major dimension contacting said barbs and to transversely align said weather stripping and wherein said guide roller does not touch said outer leg surfaces of said carrier; an idler roller mounted on said frame for supporting said loop generally opposite said guide roller in said first position of said guide roller; and a pressure roller rotatively mounted on said frame for receiving said loop from said guide roller and guiding said loop and tracing the opening of said body whereby said loop is affixed to the open of said body. 4. An EOAT described in claim 3 wherein said taper on an said guide roller adjacent said outboard leg urges outboard leg of said carrier to bend an outboard direction. 5. An EOAT for a robot used for installing a loop of weather stripping into a body opening, said EOAT in combination comprising: a frame; a guide roller rotatably mounted to said frame, said guide roller having a first position for engagement with said loop to align said weather stripping and said guide roller having a second position out of engagement with said loop; an idler roller mounted on said frame for supporting said loop generally opposite said guide roller in said first position of said guide roller; and a pressure roller rotatably mounted on said frame along a first axis being spring biased on both sides of said first axis and said pressure roller being provided for receiving said loop from said guide roller and guiding said loop and tracing the opening of said body whereby said loop is affixed to the opening of said body. 6. An EOAT for a robot used for installing a loop of weather stripping into a body opening, said weather stripping having a carrier transversely connected with a bulb, said EOAT in combination comprising: a frame; a guide roller rotatably mounted to said frame, said guide roller having a first position for engagement with said loop to align said weather stripping and said guide roller having a second position for nonengagement with said loop; an idler roller mounted to said frame for supporting said loop generally opposite said guide roller in said first position of said guide roller; and a pressure roller rotatably mounted on said frame for receiving said loop from said guide roller and guiding said loop and tracing the opening of said body whereby said loop is affixed to the opening of said body, wherein said pressure roller is contoured to mate with said carrier of said weather stripping and to avoid contact with said bulb of said weather striping when guiding said loop and tracing the opening of said body.
