The field of the present invention is that of an apparatus and method of installing weather stripping in a door and like openings using a robot. The field of the present invention is also that of an end of arm tooling device (EOAT) for a robot which installs weather stripping in a door and like openings.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method for utilizing a robot with an arm having an idler roller for supporting a fixed length of weather stripping, a guide roller having a first position for engagement with said fixed length of weather stripping opposite said idler roller and a second position for nonengagement with said fixed length of weather stripping, a fork and a pressure roller to install said fixed length of weather stripping into a body opening, said method in combination including: bracketing said fixed length by surrounding said fixed length with said fork; engaging said fixed length with said guide roller opposite said pressure roller thereby aligning said fixed length with said pressure roller; and interacting said pressure roller with said opening whereby said fixed length is guided and affixed with said opening of said body. 2. A method of utilizing a robot with an arm having an idler roller for supporting a fixed length of weather stripping having an angled corner, a guide roller having a first position for engagement with said fixed length of weather stripping opposite of said idler roller and a second position or nonengagement with said fixed length of weather stripping, and a pressure roller to install said fixed length of weather stripping into a body opening with an angled corner, said method in combination comprising: engaging said fixed length with said guide roller opposite said pressure roller thereby aligning said fixed length with said pressure roller; and tucking said angled corner of said fixed length into said angled corner of said body thereby opening and seating said fixed length of weather stripping into said corner; and interacting said pressure roller with the remainder of said opening whereby said fixed length of weather stripping is guided and affixed with the remainder of said opening of said body.
