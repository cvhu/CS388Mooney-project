This is concerned with an improved sweeping head and sweeping machine for sweeping carpet in one pass with an articulated sweeping head having an improved sweeping action and a substantial power savings.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A method of removing debris and dust from a carpet which has a base and a pile made of strands upstanding therefrom, including the steps of applying a rotary cylindrical brush to the carpet, moving the brush in a forward direction along the carpet while rotating it, causing sufficient contact between the bristles of the brush and the carpet to bend the carpet strands a predetermined amount, rotating the brush in a direction bottom side forward in the forward direction and at a speed sufficient to propel larger debris forwardly from the brush and, at the same time, to bend the carpet strands forwardly and the brush bristles rearwardly, providing a debris hopper in close proximity in front of the brush to catch and store the large debris propelled forwardly by the brush bristles, allowing the carpet strands to freely flex upwardly after the brush bristles move out of contact therewith to cause small dust particles to be propelled into the air from the carpet strands, communicating a vacuum source to a point directly adjacent and above the carpet behind the brush so that the propelled dust particles will be removed before they fall by gravity back into the carpet, and further including the step of regulating the inward air flow behind the brush in response to the vacuum source so that the air moving between the rear of the brush and the point of the vacuum source communication will be at a relatively high velocity. 2. The method of claim 1 further characterized by and including the step of supporting the brush, hopper and point of vacuum source communication, as a unit, in light contact with the carpet. 3. A method of removing debris and dust from a carpet with a carpet sweeper, constructed to be moved in a forward direction and having a frame with a sweeping head attached thereto and a rotary cylindrical brush disposed laterally in the sweeping head with a power drive for rotating the brush, including the steps of rotating the brush in interfering contact with the carpet in a direction bottom side forward in the forward direction of movement, setting the amount of interference contact between the brush and the carpet to propel larger and/or heavier debris from the carpet forwardly and to cause the carpet strands to freely flex upwardly after the brush moves out of contact therewith, providing a debris hopper in front of the brush constructed and arranged to receive and store the large and/or heavy debris propelled by the brush, communicating a vacuum source to the sweeping head behind the brush with a power means for operating it to remove smaller debris and dust propelled upwardly by the carpet after the brush moves out of contact with it, supplying adequate power to the power drive for the brush so that at least most of the large and/or heavy debris will be propelled by the brush into the debris hopper, at the same time, supplying only enough power to the power means for the vacuum source to pick up the smaller debris and dust from the carpet, and further including the step of restricting the air inlet to the sweeper head so that the dust therein will be picked up by a relatively high velocity air current. 4. The method of claim 3 further characterized by and including the step of supporting the brush, hopper and point of vacuum source communication, as a unit, in light contact with the carpet.
