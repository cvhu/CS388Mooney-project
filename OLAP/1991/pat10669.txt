A strobe light provides uniformly intense, monochromatic illumination of an object photographed by a video camera. The strobe light includes a circuit board having a central aperture and a plurality of light-emitting diodes mounted on the circuit board and generally surrounding the aperture. The circuit board is attached to the camera with the aperture positioned in front of the camera lens such that the video camera views the object through the aperture as the diodes illuminate the object. The strobe light further includes an oscillator providing an output square wave signal of adjustable frequency and duty cycle. A transistor switch controlled by the square wave signal periodically connects a constant voltage across the diodes, thereby causing the diodes simultaneously to generate flashes of light with a frequency and duty cycle determined by the square wave signal.
