The present invention provides for an apparatus and method for installing weather stripping in a body door opening. In its preferred embodiment the present invention provides a robot which can load itself from a weather stripping station, transfer the weather stripping to the body door opening, and install the weather stripping within the body door opening. The present invention also provides an end of arm tooling device for a robot above described. The present invention also includes a vehicle produced by the robot above described.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A vehicle in combination comprising: a body with an opening having corner sections and generally straight sections of a first linear length said body along said opening having a sheet metal flange; and a fixed length closed loop of elastomeric longitudinally compressible weather stripping of a second linear length greater than said first linear length, said weather stripping having a carrier with a generally U-shaped cross-sectional portion with interior barbs adapted to be press fitted over said sheet metal flange, said weather stripping being affixed with said body opening by a robot having an arm with a powered pressure roller having a variable rotational velocity and said roller interacts and traces said opening at a first linear speed and a first rotational speed along the generally straight sections of said body opening allowing said pressure roller to free wheel along said straight sections, and said pressure roller at a second linear and rotational speed differing from said first speeds interacts and traces said corner sections of said opening with said pressure roller having a point along said pressure roller periphery with a relative velocity with respect to a point on said opening corner section whereby the amount of said fixed length greater than said first linear length is longitudinally compressed along said body opening corner sections.
