A circuit panel subassembly suitable for use in an electromechanical apparatus includes a plurality of wires formed within an electrically conductive grid imbedded within a reaction injection molded panel which forms a part of the housing of the electromechanical apparatus. Wires are deployed in a pattern by using a wire organizing frame and the electrically conductive grid and the frame are subsequently imbedded in a reaction injection molded panel. Terminals attached to the ends of the wires remain exposed at spaced apart locations where components are to be mounted. Separate connector housings can be attached to the panel over the exposed terminals and other components or matable connectors can be attached thereto. The entire apparatus can be constructed robotically.
Claims We claim: 1. A molded electrical interconnection system comprising: a template having mounted thereon pins and a separable wire organizing frame which includes wire retaining blocks with grooves, a wire harness having a plurality of bare conductors laced to said frame and pins to form electrical grids, said conductors being either in a common plane or parallel to said common plane said conductors contacting said grooves and pins; free ends of said conductors being bent normal to said common plane with terminals attached thereto; and an encapsulant formed from reaction injection molded material encapsulating said template, and wire harness but not the free ends said free ends interconnecting electrical components mounted to said system.
