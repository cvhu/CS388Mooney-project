A system (10) for precisely placing a semiconductor chip (16) on a substrate (11) includes a robotic arm (18) which is provided with a gripper (22) for separately picking up the chip and substrate. A first television camera (38) is carried by the robotic arm and serves to capture the image of the substrate to locate a pair of datum points (71a and 71b) thereon. A second camera (40), stationary with respect to the robotic arm, serves to capture the image of the chip (16), when engaged by the robot, to locate each of a pair of datum points (83a and 83b) thereon. A machine vision system (46) serves to process the output signal of the cameras (38) and (40) to establish the precise location of the datum points on the substrate and on the chip. The information from the vision system (46) is employed to control the robotic arm to cause the gripper to place the chip on the substrate such that each of the datum points on the substrate is at a prescribed location relative to a separate one of the datum points on the chip.
