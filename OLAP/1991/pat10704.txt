The present invention provides an apparatus of a feeder for singulating and feeding various shaped sized and shaped parts without major modification. The present invention also provides an arrangement which utilizes the feeder.
Claims We claim: 1. An arrangement for compiling parts into individual kits made up of a first number of unique parts, each said geometrically shaped and sized unique part being stored in bulk in a separate first bin, said arrangement in combination comprising: manipulating means for taking an individual unique part and placing said unique part in said kit; at least one nest for each said geometrically shaped and sized unique part for holding said part for pickup by said manipulating means; a second number of selectively directional diverting means for selectively delivering said parts to said respective nest, said second number being less than first number; and a third number of feeders said feeders including a vibrator means; and a fiber oriented platform mounted onto said vibrator means, said platform including: a load section for accepting unique parts in bulk with fiber oriented to impart movement of said parts in a general first direction; a first compound inclined ramp section with fiber oriented to impart movement of said parts in a general second direction and being inclined to cause non-singulated parts to fall and return to said load section; a second drop off ramp for accepting singulated parts from said first ramp and with fiber oriented to impart movement to said singulated parts to a desired workstation; and a gate between said load section and said inclined ramp whereby said gate in a closed position allowing said unique parts movement between said load section and said first ramp and said gate in said open position allowing said feeder to purge itself of said first unique part and thereafter the reclosing of said gate said feeder can be used to singulate a second unique part differing from said first unique part without further adjustment, said feeders accepting said parts in bulk from said first bin and singulating said parts to said diverting means whereby said third number of feeders is lower than said first number of bins. 2. The arrangement as described in claim 1 wherein said manipulating means is a robot. 3. An arrangement as described in claim 2 wherein said robot utilizes a vision system to sense unique parts in said nest. 4. An arrangement as described in claim 1 wherein said diverter means are fiber oriented vibrational feeders with a turn table. 5. An arrangement as described in claim 4 wherein said feeder also orientates said unique part. 6. An arrangement for compiling parts into individual kits made up of a first number of unique parts, each said geometrically shaped and sized unique part being stored in bulk in a separate first bin, said arrangement in combination comprising: robotic manipulating means for sensing and then taking an individual unique part and placing said part in said kit; at least one nest for each said unique geometrically shaped and sized part for holding said part for pickup by said manipulating means; a second number of diverting means for selectively delivering said parts to said respective nest, said second number being less than said first number and said diverting means including a fiber oriented vibrational turntable; and a third number of fiber oriented vibrational feeders said feeders including a vibrator means; and a fiber oriented platform mounted onto said vibrator means, said platform including: a load section for accepting unique parts in bulk with fiber oriented to impart movement of said parts in a general first direction; a first compound inclined ramp section with fiber oriented to impart movement of said parts in general second direction and being inclined to cause non-singulated parts to fall and return to said load section; a second drop off ramp for accepting singulated parts from said first ramp and with fiber oriented to impart movement to said singulated parts to a desired workstation; and a gate between said load section and said inclined ramp whereby said gate in a closed position allowing said unique parts movement between said load section and said first ramp and said gate in said open position allowing said feeder to purge itself of said first unique part and thereafter the reclosing of said gate said feeder can be used to singulate a second unique part differing from said first unique part without further adjustment, and said feeder accepting said parts in bulk from said first bins and orientating said parts to said diverting means whereby said third number of feeders is lower than said first number of bins and whereby said feeder may also relieve itself of a first unique part after orientating a desired number of first unique parts and then after can accept in bulk a second unique part and orientate said second unique part to said diverting means without major adjustment of said feeder.
