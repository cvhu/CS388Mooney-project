The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonucleotide 8 to 50 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 580 through 599 nucleobases or nucleobases 676 through 728 of a coding region, nucleobases 996 through 1205 or nucleobases 1579 through 1598 of a 3' untranslated region of a nucleic acid molecule (SEQ ID NO: 3) encoding insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, nucleobases 11 through 30 or nucleobases 584 through 603 of a nucleic acid molecule (SEQ ID NO: 10) encoding insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, nucleobases 4214 through 4233 of an intron region or nucleobases 16817 through 16836 of an intron/exon junction region of a nucleic acid molecule (SEQ ID NO: 11) encoding insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, or nucleobases 197 through 216 of a 3' untranslated region of a nucleic acid molecule (SEQ ID NO: 12) encoding insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, wherein said oligonuclectide specifically hybridizes with one of said regions and inhibits the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5. 2. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide has a sequence comprising SEQ ID No: 15, 18, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 or 43. 3. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 4. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 3 wherein the modified initernucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 5. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 6. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 5 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-o-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 7. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 8. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 7 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 9. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 wherein the antisense oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 10. A composition comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 11. The composition of claim 10 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system. 12. A method of inhibiting the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 in cells or tissues in vitro comprising contacting said cells or tissues in vitro with the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 so that expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 is inhibited. 13. An antisense oligonucleotide consisting of SEQ ID NO: 14, 16, 17, 19, 21 or 25.
