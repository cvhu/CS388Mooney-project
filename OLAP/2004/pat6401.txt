A microchip fabrication chamber has a pedestal adapted to retain a wafer during processing steps conducted within the chamber. A lift mechanism including a plurality of lift mechanism pins engages and disengages a wafer to the pedestal. A sensor associated with the tip of at least one of the lift mechanism pins detects the presence of the wafer.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. Micro chip fabrication apparatus for processing a wafer comprising: a chamber for processing the wafer, a plurality of pairs of lift mechanism pins within the chamber for supporting the wafer and a plurality of capacitive proximity sensors disposed substantially at a tip of each of said plurality of lift mechanism pins for detecting the wafer position wherein; the pairs of the plurality of capacitive proximity sensors are configured to detect a capacitance between an associated pair of lift mechanism pins. 2. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein; each of the plurality of capacitive proximity sensors detects the wafer in cooperation with an associated lift mechanism pin. 3. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the tip of at least one of said plurality of lift mechanism pins has capacitive proximity sensing means disposed substantially within the tip for detecting the proximity of the wafer. 4. The apparatus as claimed in claim 3 wherein the capacitive proximity sensing means comprise respective pins. 5. The apparatus as claimed in claim 3 wherein the capacitive proximity sensing means comprises a probe electrode through a central longitudinal bore of a respective pin, the probe electrode extending from a tip of said at least one of said plurality of lift mechanism pins. 6. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 further comprising: A capacitive sense logic circuit in communication with the capacitive proximity sensor for determining if a wafer is out of position.
