Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of PLML. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding PLML. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of PLML expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of PLML are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonucleotide 8 to 80 nucleobases in length targeted to nucleobases 694 through 799 of a 3'-untranslated region of a nucleic acid molecule encoding human PLML (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein said antisense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes with said region of said nucleic acid molecule encoding human PLML. 2. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 which comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 3. The antisense oligonuclootide of claim 2 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 4. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 which comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 5. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 4 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2-o-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 6. The antiseniseoligonucleotide of claim 1 which comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 7. The antisense oligonucleotide of clai 6 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 8. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 which is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 9. A composition comprising the antisense oligonucleoticie of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 10. The composition of claim 9 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system.
