A method and apparatus for the automated milking of dairy cattle employing live capture of the teats of a dairy cow without requiring identification of a particular dairy cow or the prior knowledge of the location of the individual teats. The live capture milking apparatus locates the individual teats of a dairy cow and attaches a teatcup to the teat without the need for human intervention. After the milking operation is completed, the live capture milking apparatus returns to a home position where cleaning and sanitization the milking equipment occurs.
Claims Having thus described the aforementioned invention, I claim: 1. An apparatus for milking a dairy cow, said apparatus comprising: a controller; a main support capable of longitudinal extension; a main positioning arm capable of longitudinal extension, said main positioning arm responsive to said controller; a rotary actuator responsive to said controller, said rotary actuator capable of rotary movement, said rotary actuator connecting said main positioning arm to said main support; a secondary positioning arm capable of longitudinal extension, said secondary positioning arm being orthogonally connected to said main positioning arm, said secondary positioning arm responsive to said controller; a milking platform secured to said secondary positioning arm; and a plurality of seeker arms, each of said plurality of seeker arms including: a lateral positioner carried by said milking platform, said lateral positioner responsive to said controller; a longitudinal positioner carried by said milking platform, said longitudinal positioner responsive to said controller; an elevator carried by said milking platform, said elevator responsive to said controller; at least one lateral sensor associated with said lateral positioner for detecting a teat of the dairy cow; at least one longitudinal sensor associated with said longitudinal positioner for detecting a teat of the dairy cow; and a milk collection unit carried by said seeker arm; wherein said controller guides each of said plurality of seeker arms based upon feedback from said at least one lateral sensor and said at least on longitudinal sensor such that said milk collection unit is attached to a teat of the dairy cow. 2. The apparatus for milking of a dairy cow of claim 1 further comprising a distance sensor carried by said milking platform, said distance sensor in communication with said controller wherein said controller moves said milking platform to maintain a fixed distance between said milking platform and the teats of the dairy cow. 3. An apparatus for milking a dairy cow, said apparatus comprising: a controller; a milking platform; a plurality of milk collection units; a major positioning system responsive to said controller, said major positioning system moving said milking platform in three dimensions and rotating said milking platform about a fixed point; a plurality of sensors carried by said milking platform, said plurality of sensors in communication with said controller, said plurality of sensors adapted to identify a teat of the dairy cow; and a plurality of minor positioning systems responsive to said controller, each of said minor positioning systems being carried by said milking platform, each of said minor positioning systems moving a corresponding one of said plurality of milk collection units in three dimensions and attaching said corresponding one of said plurality of milk collection units to a teat of the dairy cow identified by said plurality of sensors.
