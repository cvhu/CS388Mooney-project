Antisense compounds, compositions and methods are provided for modulating the expression of EDG1. The compositions comprise antisense compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to nucleic acids encoding EDG1. Methods of using these compounds for modulation of EDG1 expression and for treatment of diseases associated with expression of EDG1 are provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An antisense oligonuclecide 20 to 80 nucleobased in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding endothelial differentiation gene 1, wherein said antisense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes with said nucleic acid molecule encoding endothelial differentiation gene 1 (SEQ ID NO: 4) and has a suquence comprising SEQ ID NO: 33, 54, 63, 68, 69, 70, 75, 76 or 81, and inhibits the expression of endothelial differentiation gene 1. 2. The antisense oligonucileotide of claim 1 which comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 3. The antisense oligonucileotide of claim 2 wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 4. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 which comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 5. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 4 wherein the modified sugar moiety is a 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar moiety. 6. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 which comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 7. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 6 wherein the modified nucleobase is a 5-methylcytosine. 8. The antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 which is a chimeric oligonucleotide. 9. A composition comprising the antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. 10. The composition of claim 9 further comprising a colloidal dispersion system.
