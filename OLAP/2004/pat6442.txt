In a single-row and expandable into a multi-row stretch blow molding method and apparatus, at least one row of tray plates in a tray unit is used to collect molded preforms ejected from the opening clamp of a preform-molding unit, transfer the preforms with or without transfer beads out of the molding area and align them with the center row distances of the downstream processing units. At least one robot having a universal gripper assembly is used to pick up either all or consecutively fractions of the preforms align them to the center distances of the blow mold cavities to place them at variable time intervals into a conditioning, stretch blow molding and oriented discharge unit, releases finished hollow articles and returns to a waiting position at the preform-molding and tray unit again at the preform mold's center distance independent of the preform-molding cycle. Simultaneously, component transfer devices may pick up external components, i.e. labels, valves or handles during the stretch blow molding phase and release the components into the blow-mold cavities while the universal gripper assembly is in the waiting position. The universal gripper assembly can alternatively also be pivoted to pick up preforms from a lateral reheat unit to supplement the molded preform supply. A modular stack-blow-mold clamp assembly is equipped with at least one row of blow mold cavities and with a plurality of pivoting spacing platens which in conjunction with helical spindles and nuts open and close the blow-mold halves and align their respective parting lines to correspond with the center-row distances of the transfer tray plates, conditioning and stretch blow means. Prior to the transfer of the molded preforms to a conditioning unit, internal components, i.e. sleeves or liners can be inserted into the neck and body portion of the preforms. Further, a secondary robot with a gripper assembly can pick up pretreated preforms from the first set of blow molds and transfer them into one or several consecutive blow mold assemblies all to obtain heat stable hollow articles or improved hollow article barrier performance prior to discharging.
