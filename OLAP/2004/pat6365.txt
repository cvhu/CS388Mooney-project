An apparatus enabling preparation and use of a fixed abrasive polishing member is described. The apparatus includes a patterned three-dimensional substrate, an abrasive coating a surface of the patterned substrate and a vacuum deposition chamber in which the abrasive is applied to the surface of the substrate. In addition, rather than a fixed abrasive, non-abrasive material may be applied to the surface of the patterned substrate, in which case, a conventional slurry may be used in planarization of an applied semiconductor wafer.
