A system for staining and coverslipping specimen slides, having a stainer (1) and a coverslipper (3) that are arranged next to one another. A transfer device (2), which transports racks with specimen slides from the stainer (1) to the coverslipper (3), is provided between the stainer (1) and the coverslipper (3). Transport is automated so that operation by the user is substantially reduced.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for staining and coverslipping specimen slides, said system comprising: a stainer (1); a coverslipper (3); and a transfer device (2) between said stainer (1) and said coverslipper (3) for transporting said specimen slides from said stainer (1) to said coverslipper (3); wherein said transfer device (2) includes a transport device (35) for carrying a rack holding a plurality of said specimen slides, said transport device (35) being configured so that it can extend into said coverslipper (3); and wherein said transfer device (2) comprises a housing (27) including a bottom (28), a front panel (25), a back wall (29) opposite the front panel (25), a first side wall (22) having a first cutout (21) therethrough, and a second side wall (24) opposite said first side wall (22) having a second cutout (23) therethrough, said first and second cutouts defining a passage (20) through said housing (27); said housing (27) further including a transfer position (30) for racks near said first cutout (21) in said first side wall (22); and wherein said transport device (35) extends substantially from said transfer position (30) to beyond said second cutout (23) in said second side wall (24). 2. The system as defined in claim 1, wherein said stainer (1) comprises a lateral opening aligned with said first cutout (21) in said first side wall (22) of said transfer device (2); and said coverslipper (3) comprises an opening (33) aligned with said second cutout (23) in said second side wall (24) of said transfer device (2). 3. A system for staining and coverslipping specimen slides, said system comprising: a stainer (1); a coverslipper (3); and a transfer device (2) between said stainer (1) and said coverslipper (3) for transporting said specimen slides from said stainer (1) to said coverslipper (3); wherein said transfer device (2) comprises a first sidewall (22) and a second side wall (24) opposite said first side wall, said stainer (1) comprises a side wall (32) opposite said first side wall (22) of said transfer device (2), said coverslipper (3) comprises a side wail (13) opposite said second side wall (24) of said transfer device (2), said side wall (32) of said stainer (1) and said first side wall (22) of said transfer device (2) include coacting attachment elements (26), and said side wall (13) of said coverslipper (3) and said second side wall (24) of said transfer device (2) include coacting attachment elements (26). 4. The system as defined in claim 1, wherein said front panel (25) of said transfer device (2) is configured as a drawer in order to remove racks deposited by said transfer device (2). 5. A system for staining and coverslipping specimen slides, said system comprising: a stainer(1); a coverslipper (3); and a transfer device (2) between said stainer (1) and said coverslipper (3) for transporting said specimen slides from said stainer (1) to said coverslipper (3); wherein said coverslipper (3) comprises electronics, a first drawer (17) that enables access to said electronics, a detachable panel (18) on a side thereof facing away from said transfer device (2), whereby a user can gain access to an interior of said coverslipper (3).
