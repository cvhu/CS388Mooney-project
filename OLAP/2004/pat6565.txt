A system is disclosed for safeguarding fab operators and workpieces such as semiconductor wafers from harm as a result of collision between an operator and a transport assembly for the workpieces as the workpieces are transported between tools and storage nests within a tool bay.
Claims We claim: 1. A safeguarding system for a tool bay of a semiconductor wafer fab, the safeguarding system capable of preventing potential conflict at a tool between an assembly for transporting pods and an operator at the tool, the system comprising: a first sensor for sensing the presence of the operator proximate to the tool; a second sensor for sensing the presence of the pod transport assembly proximate to the tool; and a control system for 1) preventing the pod transport assembly from accessing the tool in the event said first sensor senses the operator proximate to the tool; or 2) stopping the pod transport assembly in the event said first sensor senses the operator proximate to the tool and said second sensor senses the pod transport assembly proximate to the tool. 2. A safeguarding system for a tool bay of a semiconductor wafer fab as recited in claim 1, wherein said first sensor comprises a light curtain including a plurality of break-the-beam sensors mounted to a front portion of the tool. 3. A safeguarding system for a tool bay of a semiconductor wafer fab as recited in claim 1, wherein said second sensor comprises a break-the-beam sensor mounted above the tool. 4. A safeguarding system for a tool bay of a semiconductor wafer fab, the tool bay including a pod transport assembly for transporting pods at a first speed when positioned above a reference height and for transporting pods at a second speed when positioned below the reference height, the second speed being slower than the first speed, the safeguarding system capable of preventing the pod transport system from moving at the first speed below the reference height, the system comprising: a first sensor for sensing the speed of a moving portion of the transport assembly; a second sensor for sensing the height of said moving portion of the transport assembly; and a control system for stopping the pod transport assembly in the event said first sensor senses said moving portion moving above said second speed and said second sensor senses a height of said moving portion below the reference height.
