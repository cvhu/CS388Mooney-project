An annular cross-sectioned clutch assembly for connecting a tool such as a paint gun to the end of a robotic arm is provided. A diaphragm-mounting plate connects on an outer side to the end of the robotic arm. An annular diaphragm is mounted to the diaphragm-mounting plate. The diaphragm has an inner surface, with the inner surface forming a pressure tight chamber with the diaphragm-mounting plate for connection to a programable source of air pressure. A clutch plate has an annular diaphragm-engagement surface engaged with a central portion of the diaphragm. Springs between the clutch plate and the diaphragm-mounting plate bias the clutch plate away from the diaphragm-mounting plate in conjunction with air pressure in the chamber. Structure is provided to establish a normal position of the clutch assembly. Additional structure is provided to establish physical limits of travel of the clutch plate with respect to the diaphragm-mounting plate. Electrical devices generate an electrical signal in response to movement of the clutch plate away from the normal position.
Claims I claim: 1. A clutch assembly for connecting a paint gun to the end of a robotic arm, comprising: a diaphragm-mounting plate adapted to be connected on an outer side to the end of the robotic arm; an annular diaphragm mounted to the diaphragm-mounting plate, the diaphragm having an inner surface, the inner surface forming a pressure tight chamber with the diaphragm-mounting plate for connection to a programmable source of air pressure; a clutch plate having an annular diaphragm-engagement surface engaged with a central portion of the diaphragm; springs between the clutch plate and the diaphragm-mounting plate to bias the clutch plate away from the diaphragm-mounting plate in conjunction with air pressure in the chamber; means for establishing a normal position of the clutch assembly; means for forming physical limits of travel of the clutch plate with respect to the diaphragm-mounting plate; means for generating an electrical signal in response to movement of the clutch plate away from the normal position; and, with the diaphragm-mounting plate having inwardly-extending diaphragm-mounting walls on an inner side, and with inner portions of the diaphragm-mounting walls forming the chamber. 2. A clutch assembly for connecting a paint gun to the end of a robotic arm, comprising: a diaphragm-mounting plate adapted to be connected on an outer side to the end of the robotic arm; an annular diaphragm mounted to the diaphragm-mounting plate, the diaphragm having an inner surface, the inner surface forming a pressure tight chamber with the diaphragm-mounting plate for connection to a programmable source of air pressure; a clutch plate having an annular diaphragm-engagement surface engaged with a central portion of the diaphragm; springs between the clutch plate and the diaphragm-mounting plate to bias the clutch plate away from the diaphragm-mounting plate in conjunction with air pressure in the chamber; means for establishing a normal position of the clutch assembly; means for forming physical limits of travel of the clutch plate with respect to the diaphragm-mounting plate; means for generating an electrical signal in response to movement of the clutch plate away from the normal position; and, with the means for forming physical limits of travel of the clutch plate with respect to the diaphragm-mounting plate including cylindrical pins parallel to but spaced apart from a central axis of the clutch assembly and fixed to an outwardly-facing portion of the clutch plate, and walls forming capsule-shaped holes on a surface connected to the diaphragm-mounting plate engaged with the cylindrical pins, the capsule-shaped holes being spaced from the pins. 3. A clutch assembly for connecting a paint gun to the end of a robotic arm, comprising: a diaphragm-mounting plate adapted to be connected on an outer side to the end of the robotic arm and having inwardly-extending diaphragm-mounting walls on an inner side; an annular diaphragm mounted over outer portions of the diaphragm-mounting walls, the diaphragm having an inner surface, the inner surface with inner portions of the diaphragm-mounting walls forming a pressure tight chamber with the diaphragm inner surface for connection to a programmable source of air pressure; an inner clamp ring fixing an inner portion of the diaphragm to diaphragm-mounting walls; an outer clamp ring fixing an outer portion of the diaphragm to the diaphragm-mounting walls, a clutch plate having an annular diaphragm-engagement surface engaged with a central portion of the diaphragm; springs between the clutch plate and the diaphragm-mounting plate to bias the clutch plate away from the diaphragm-mounting plate in conjunction with air pressure in the chamber; spherical pins on the clutch plate; spherical seats on an inwardly-facing portion of the outer clamp ring engaged with the spherical pins for establishing a normal position of the clutch assembly; cylindrical pins parallel to but spaced apart from a central axis of the clutch assembly and fixed to an outwardly-facing portion of the clutch plate; walls forming capsule-shaped holes on the outer clamp ring engaged with the cylindrical pins, the capsule-shaped holes being spaced from the pins to form physical limits of travel of the clutch plate with respect to the outer clamp ring; and electrical switches attached to the clutch plate positioned to detect movement of the clutch plate away from the normal position.
