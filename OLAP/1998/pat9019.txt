An apparatus, method and purge concentrate are capable of purging water-based and non-water-based paints and other coatings from automated and manual equipment using non-VOC containing aqueous purge solutions. Purge solutions of the invention contain water, detergent builder and wetting agents. The solution is maintained at a selected concentration and at a selected elevated temperature range by continuously recirculating the solution through the automated coating equipment. For manual equipment the solution is set at the correct concentration and maintained at the correct temperature range. For an automated system, spent purge solution can be reconditioned and recirculated to avoid waste.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A purge concentrate for purging coating equipment, comprising: about 75%-85% by weight water; about 1%-20% by weight sodium silicate; about 0.01%-7% by weight modified ethoxylated surfactant; and further comprising potassium hydroxide and a sodium salt of glucoheptonic acid. 2. A purge concentrate according to claim 1, including an organic acid. 3. A purge concentrate according to claim 2 including a carboxylic acid salt. 4. A purge concentrate according to claim 3 wherein the organic acid comprises caprylic acid. 5. A purge concentrate according to claim 2 including anionic phosphate ester. 6. A purge concentrate according to claim 5 wherein the organic acid comprises caprylic acid. 7. A purge concentrate according to claim 1 including tetra potassium pyrophosphate.
