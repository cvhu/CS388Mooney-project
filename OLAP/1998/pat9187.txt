An electronic device includes an electronic circuit having points for introducing power supply voltage, ground return, and at least one output. A keyless device package holds the electronic circuit, and the keyless device package is subject to misorientation. Terminals, including terminals for power supply voltage, the ground return and the output, are connected to the electronic circuit and secured to the device package. The terminals are distributed on the device package so that a turning reorientation of the entire electronic device translates the terminals to each other only in a way which prevents electrical stress to the electronic circuit due to possible misorientation of the electronic device under test. Other devices, systems and methods are also disclosed.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for selecting pin locations for an electronic device, comprising: determining the rotational positions of said electronic device; selecting symmetrical pin locations for preselected functions of said electronic device so that a preselected pin location for a selected function rotationally maps into another pin location for said selected pin function or rotationally maps into a no voltage pin location. 2. An electronic device, comprising: an electronic circuit having points for supplying power supply voltage and ground return thereto and for providing at least one output therefrom; a device package for holding said electronic circuit and having at least one rotational misorientation; and a plurality of terminals connected to said points of said electronic circuit and fixedly secured to said device package and arranged on said device package in such a manner that a rotational misorientation of said electronic circuit or device package does not cause electrical stress to said electronic circuit.
