A micro-working apparatus performs fabrication and assembly tasks for micron/nanometer sized objects while progress of operations is observed in real-time by at least a pair of optical or electron microscopes to provide simultaneous views from at least two directions. This offers spatial visual information regarding the working space which is particularly critical in micro-working. Micro-working is further facilitated by the use of a micro-pallet device specially designed for use in the apparatus, but also offering other application possibilities. Rotational and parallel translation movements provided by the micro-pallet combined with the micro-working capability of the apparatus are utilized to enable production of micron-sized parts for use in advanced applications of optical and electronic devices.
