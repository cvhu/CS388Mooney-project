A hydraulic rotary actuator has a housing with at least one rib on its inside wall and a motor shaft with at least one vane on its outside shell surface, whereby the housing with its ribs and the motor shaft with its vanes form a working chamber which is closed off on the ends by means of a cap. A gasket is located between the motor shaft and a component of the housing to seal the working chamber off from the environment. The gasket and housing component can preferably form a latching mechanism therebetween to retain the gasket in position during assembly of the rotary actuator.

A rotary actuator comprising: housing means; means for connecting said housing means to a first portion of a motor vehicle suspension; shaft means, said shaft means having a longitudinal axis; at least a portion of said shaft means being rotatably disposed within said housing means; means for connecting said shaft means to a second portion of a motor vehicle suspension; bearing means for rotatably mounting said at least a portion of said shaft means within said housing means for rotation of at least one of said shaft means and said housing means about said longitudinal axis with respect to the other of said shaft means and said housing means; said shaft means comprising an outer surface disposed towards said housing means; said housing means comprising an inner surface disposed towards said outer surface; a chamber disposed between said outer surface of said shaft means and said inner surface of said housing means, said chamber having a first axial end and a second axial end; said outer surface of said shaft means comprising at least one vane means extending towards said housing means; said inner surface of said housing means comprising at least one rib means extending towards said shaft means; said at least one vane means and said at least one rib means being disposed to divide said chamber into a first chamber portion and a second chamber portion; said housing means comprising means for closing at least one of said first and second axial ends of said chamber; gasket means for sealing said housing means about said shaft means; and catch means for retaining said gasket means within said housing means during at least a portion of assembly of said actuator. 4. The rotary actuator according to claim 3, wherein: said catch means comprises means for permitting axial movement of said gasket means in the direction of the longitudinal axis. 5. The rotary actuator according to claim 4, wherein: said catch means comprises a projection; and said catch means comprises a recess for retaining said projection. 6. The rotary actuator according to claim 5, wherein: said recess comprises a retaining surface for contacting said projection to retain said gasket means; said recess and projection are dimensioned to permit axial separation between said projection and said retaining surface by an axial distance to permit axial movement of said gasket means; and the axial distance is dimensioned to be greater than an axial dimension of wear of said gasket means. 7. The rotary actuator according to claim 6, wherein: said means for closing comprises cap means; said cap means comprises a groove disposed circumferentially around said shaft means; and said gasket means is disposed in said groove. 8. The rotary actuator according to claim 7, wherein: said gasket means comprises said projection; and said groove comprises said recess. 9. The rotary actuator according to claim 8, wherein: said shaft means comprises a surface disposed axially adjacent said gasket means; and said cap means comprises means for biasing said gasket means in an axial direction towards said axial surface of said shaft means. 10. The rotary actuator according to claim 9, wherein: said gasket means comprises a first gasket part and a second gasket part; said first gasket part is disposed to contact said axial surface of said shaft means to seal between said shaft and said cap means; said second gasket part is disposed adjacent to said bias means to transfer a force from said bias means to said first gasket part; and said gasket means comprises means for biasing and moving said first gasket part axially and radially. 11. The rotary actuator according to claim 10, wherein: said first gasket biasing and moving means comprises facing beveled surfaces in contact between said first gasket part and said second gasket part. 12. The rotary actuator according to claim 11, wherein: said projection is an elastic snap hook; said recess extends continuously and circumferentially around said cap means; said projection extends continuously and circumferentially around said gasket means; said projection comprises means for guiding insertion of said gasket means into said cap means; said gasket guiding means comprises a beveled surface disposed on said projection; said projection is elastically deformable to permit insertion of said gasket means into said cap means; said first gasket part is axially offset from said second gasket part; said first gasket part comprises a cylindrical extension surrounding said second gasket part; said second gasket part comprises a conical ring having a base portion for engaging said biasing means and a central bore therein for being disposed about said shaft means; said biasing means comprises a spring; said facing beveled surfaces in contact between said first gasket part and said second gasket part are disposed at an angle of about 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis; said cap means comprises said bearing means for rotatably mounting said shaft means; said cap means comprises at least one cap separate from said housing means, said cap being welded to said housing means to affix said cap to said housing means; said at least one cap comprises first and second caps, with one of said caps disposed at each of said first and second axial ends of said chamber; said shaft means comprises at least two vanes; and said housing means comprises at least two ribs.
