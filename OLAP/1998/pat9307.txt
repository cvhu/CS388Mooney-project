A guide member for guiding a wire from a nozzle of a gas metal-arc welding device. The guide member includes a ceramic body portion having a generally centrally located opening for receiving and guiding an electrode wire therethrough. A plurality of gas diffusion openings are provided in the ceramic body portion radially outward from the centrally located opening. The guide member allows an extended wire stick out and a narrower tapered nozzle while protecting the nozzle and contact tip from spatter and heat and thereby enhances welding performance.
Claims I claim: 1. A gas metal-arc welding device, comprising: a ceramic nozzle; and a ceramic nozzle cap formed integrally with said ceramic nozzle and having a wire receiving hole in a center portion thereof for receiving and guiding an electrode wire of said gas metal-arc welding device. 2. The welding device according to claim 1, wherein said ceramic nozzle cap includes a plurality of gas diffusion holes disposed radially outward from said wire receiving hole for diffusing a shielding gas supplied through said ceramic nozzle by said gas metal-arc welding device. 3. The welding device according to claim 1, further comprising a nozzle-touch sensing device supported on said ceramic nozzle. 4. The welding device according to claim 1, wherein said ceramic nozzle cap is provided with an axially extending portion defining said wire receiving hole. 5. A gas metal-arc welding device, comprising: a nozzle; an electrically conducting contact tip disposed within said nozzle; a ceramic nozzle cap spaced from said contact tip and having a wire receiving hole in a center portion thereof for receiving and guiding an electrode wire of said gas metal-are welding device; and a metal insert for defining said wire receiving hole in said ceramic nozzle cap.
