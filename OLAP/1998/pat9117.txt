In an automated welding machine, where a flow of liquid coolant is supplied to welding components on the machine from a source of coolant and then returned to the source of coolant, a safety system is provided that shuts down the flow of coolant in the event of a fault. Faults are detected by a supply sensor and a return sensor for measuring the flow rates of coolant in the supply and return lines. A microprocessor is adapted to compare the supply flow rate and return flow rate and detect differences between the two rates. The difference between the detected rates as compared to a leak threshold value, and the microprocessor is adapted to generate a valve shutoff signal in the event the detected difference in flow rates exceeds the leak threshold value. A valve in the supply coolant line is responsive to the valve shutoff signal to shutoff flow of coolant in response thereto.
