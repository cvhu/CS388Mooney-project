The invention relates to a process for the application of components strung together in the manner of a belt onto workpieces in which the components are intermittently brought successively into a separating position for a respective component. The component halted in the separating position is initially grasped by a spatially movable jointing tool brought to the separating position over a free path, the jointing tool being held in its position defined by the halted component, the grasped component then severed from the subsequent component and is finally transferred by the jointing tool into the respectively desired jointing position remote from the separating position, in which the component is fastened on the workpiece, for example by electric arc welding.
Claims We claim: 1. A method for delivering components connected together in a continuous strip to a point of installation on a workpiece comprising the steps of delivering successive components to a separation position by repeatedly advancing said strip; providing a moveable jointing tool for gripping successive components and for moving each successive component to an installation point, said jointing tool being freely moveable through said separation point; moving said jointing tool towards said separation point so that it engages the next successive component on the strip, the movement of said jointing tool being stopped at said separation point by the connection of said next successive component to said strip; separating the next successive component from the strip so that said jointing tool is immediately thereupon free to move said component to said installation point; and attaching said component to said workpiece. 2. Apparatus for rapidly delivering components successively separated from a continuous strip to a point of installation on a workpiece comprising a supply path for guiding the strip of components to present the leading component on the strip at a separation point; a cutting device for successively separating said leading component from said strip; a jointing tool freely moveable to and through said separation position, said tool including means for gripping said leading component, said tool being further moveable from said separation position to an installation position; strip drive means for advancing successive leading components on said strip into said separation position; and means allowing said jointing tool to move to said separation position for engaging said leading component, said movement means allowing for the continued movement of said jointing tool to said installation position as soon as said leading component is severed from said strip. 3. A device for carrying out a process of applying components (2, 12) connected sequentially in an elongated belt onto workpieces, in which the components (2, 12) are brought intermittently in succession into a separating position for a respective component (2, 12), characterized in that the component (2, 12), halted in the separating position is initially grasped by a spatially movable jointing tool (21) brought to the separating position along a free path of motion extending from a start position through the separating position to a jointing position, the jointing tool (21) being held at the separating position by engagement with the halted component (12), the grasped component (12) is then severed from the subsequent component (2) and is finally brought by the jointing tool (21) into the respectively desired jointing position (28') which is remote from the separating position and in which the component (2) is fastened onto the workpiece (37) by welding, said device being characterized in that, for supplying the sequentially connected components (2) there is provided a supply duct (8) which extends to a separating blade (10) determining the separating position and, after the separating blade (10), passes into a receiving duct (9) for the jointing tool (21) which serves to receive the jointing tool (21) and to support it in front of the separating position when the component (2) is grasped. 4. Device according to claim 3, characterized in that an advance arrangement (13, 14) is provided in supply duct (8) for the intermittent displacement and halting of the components (2). 5. Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the jointing tool (21) is provided with a clamping arrangement (19, 20) for a component (2, 12). 6. Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the receiving duct (9) is provided with a sensor (17) which, on introduction of the jointing tool (21) into the receiving duct (9) and attainment of the grasping position, triggers a sequence control system (30) by means of which the grasping of the components (2, 12) by the jointing tool (21), the severing of the last component (12) and the removal of the components (12) with the jointing tool (21) from the receiving duct (9) and the next supply stage are triggered in succession. 7. A device for carrying out a process of applying components (2, 12) connected sequentially in a elongated belt onto workpieces, in which the component (2, 12) are brought intermittently in succession into a separating position for a respective component (2, 12), characterized in that the component (2, 12) halted in the separating position is initially grasped by a spatially movable jointing tool (21) brought to the separating position along a free path of motion extending from a start position through the separating position to a jointing position, the jointing tool (21) being held at the separating position by engagement with the halted component (12), the grasped component (12) is then severed from the subsequent component (2) and is finally brought by the jointing tool (21) into the respectively desired jointing position (28') which is remote from the separating position and in which the component (2) is fastened onto the workpiece (37) by welding, said device being characterized in that a separating blade (10) which is movable transversely to the supply duct (8) between a basic location, a cutting location and a correcting location is coupled to a correcting member (26) for the penultimate respective component (2), the separating blade (10) clearing the way for displacement of the components (2) in the basic location, the last respective component (12) being severed in the cutting location and the situation of the penultimate component (2) and therefore of the string optionally being corrected in the correcting location.
