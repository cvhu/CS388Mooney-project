A reflective element assembly for a variable reflectance vehicular mirror includes a front substrate having a transparent conductive coating disposed on a second surface thereof, and a rear substrate having an electrically conductive metallic reflective coating disposed on a third surface thereof. At least an edge portion of the rear substrate is recessed from a corresponding perimeter edge portion of the front substrate so as to define an overhang region of the front substrate relative to the rear substrate. At least a portion of a third surface conductive coating continues from the third surface over at least the perimeter edge to define a wraparound portion of the third surface conductive coating at the perimeter edge, with the third surface conductive coating establishing electrical continuity between the third surface and the portion of the perimeter edge. An electrical connection may make electrical contact with the wraparound portion at the overhang region.
Claims What is claimed is: 1.

A mirror reflective element assembly for a variable reflectance vehicular mirror, said mirror reflective element assembly comprising: a front substrate having a first surface and a second surface, said front substrate comprising a first perimeter edge around its perimeter and between said first surface and said second surface; said second surface having a transparent electrically conductive coating disposed thereon; a rear substrate having a third surface and a fourth surface, said rear substrate comprising a second perimeter edge around its perimeter and between said third surface and said fourth surface; said third surface having an electrically conductive coating disposed thereon, at least a portion of said third surface conductive coating continuing from said third surface over at least a portion of said second perimeter edge to define a wraparound portion of said third surface conductive coating at said portion of said second perimeter edge, said third surface conductive coating establishing electrical continuity between said third surface and said portion of said second perimeter edge; said rear substrate having a dimension that is less than a corresponding dimension of said front substrate such that at least an edge portion of said rear substrate is recessed from the perimeter edge of a corresponding portion of said front substrate so as to define an overhang region of said front substrate relative to said rear substrate, said wraparound portion of said third surface conductive coating being disposed at said recessed edge portion of said rear substrate and at least partially under said overhang region of said front substrate; an electro-optic medium disposed between said second surface conductive coating and said third surface conductive coating; a first electrical connection making electrical contact with said wraparound portion of said third surface conductive coating at said recessed edge portion, said first electrical connection being operable to power said third surface conductive coating; and wherein said second surface of said front substrate includes a perimeter band disposed around a perimeter border of said front substrate. 3. The mirror reflective element assembly of claim 2, wherein an electrically insulating layer applied over said transparent conductive coating on said second surface of said front substrate and at least partially along said overhang region of said front substrate that generally corresponds with said recessed edge portion of said rear substrate, said insulating layer electrically insulating said second surface transparent conductive coating of said front substrate from electrical contact with said first electrical connection. 4. The mirror reflective element assembly of claim 2, wherein said perimeter band comprises a metallic reflective material. 5. The mirror reflective element assembly of claim 2, wherein said perimeter band comprises a non-reflective material. 6. The mirror reflective element assembly of claim 2, wherein the vehicular mirror comprises an interior vehicular mirror. 7.
