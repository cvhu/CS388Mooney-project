A recombinant Mtb peptide or polypeptide, wherein the amino terminus of said peptide or polypeptide comprises a HA tag or a His tag, and the carboxy terminus of said peptide or polypeptide is selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOS: 68, 70, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 83, 122 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 132, and 133. 5. A recombinant Mtb peptide or polypeptide, wherein the carboxy terminus of said peptide or polypeptide comprises a HA tag or a His tag, and the amino terminus of said peptide or polypeptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 68, 70, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 83, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 132 and 133. 6. A composition comprising at least one isolated Mtb peptide or polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOS: 68, 70, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 83, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 132, and 133, or an immunogenic fragment thereof, and a pharmaceuticallv acceptable carrier. 7. The composition of claim 6, further comprising an adjuvant. 8. A method of generating an immune response in a mammalian host against Mtb comprising administering to said mammalian host at least one peptide, polypeptide or immunogenic fragment thereof of claim 1 or any combination thereof, whereby said immune response against Mtb is generated. 9. The method according to claim 8, further comprising administering an adjuvant to said mammalian host. 10. A kit comprising: a) at least one peptide or polypeptide of claim 1; and b) an adjuvant. 11. The kit of claim 10 comprising at least two of said polypeptides or peptides. 12. The composition of claim 6, wherein said peptide or polypeptide or immunogenic fragment thereof is a native protein. 13. The composition of claim 6, wherein said peptide or polypeptide or immunogenic fragment thereof is conjugated to a molecule. 14. The composition of claim 13, wherein said molecule is a polysaccharide. 15. The composition of claim 6, wherein said peptide or polypeptide is part of a complex of multiple polypeptide chains. 16. The composition of claim 6, wherein said peptide or polypeptide reacts with polyclonal antibodies directed to Mtb bacteria. 17. The composition of claim 6, wherein said Mtb peptide or polypeptide further comprises a tag, wherein said tag is at the amino terminus or carboxy terminus of said Mtb polypeptide. 18. The composition of claim 17, wherein said tag is a His tag or an HA tag. 19. A kit comprising: a) at least one composition of claim 6; and b) an adjuvant. 20. The kit of claim 19, comprising at least two of said immunogenic compositions. 21. A method of generating an immune response in a mammalian host against Mtb comprising administering to said mammalian host at least one composition of claim 6, or combination thereof, whereby said immune response against Mtb is generated.
