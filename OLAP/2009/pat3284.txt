A printhead assembly is provided comprising at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, a support member supporting and carrying the printing fluid for the printhead integrated circuits, and at least two flexible printed circuit boards for connecting electrical signals to the printhead integrated circuits. The assembly further comprises drive electronics incorporating at least one controller which is connected to at least one of the printhead integrated circuits via the respective flexible printed circuit board for controlling the printing operation thereof, and a casing in which the printhead module and drive electronics are removably mounted. The drive electronics is provided on a printed circuit board carrying connection ports for connecting with the flexible circuit boards by being directly aligned with the flexible printed circuit boards and printhead integrated circuits.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A printhead assembly, comprising: at least one printhead module comprising at least two printhead integrated circuits, each of which has nozzles formed therein for delivering printing fluid onto the surface of print media, one support member supporting, and carrying the printing fluid for, the at least two printhead integrated circuits, and at least two flexible printed circuit boards for connecting electrical signals to the at least two printhead integrated circuits, each flexible printed circuit board having a connecting portion; drive electronics incorporating a plurality of controllers, at least one controller being connected to at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits via the respective flexible printed circuit board for controlling the printing operation of at least one of the at least two printhead integrated circuits; and a casing in which the at least one printhead module and the drive electronics are removably mounted, wherein each controller and the associated drive electronics is provided on a associated printed circuit board carrying respective slotted connection ports for receiving, and connecting with, the corresponding connecting portions of the flexible printed circuit boards, the connecting portions being configured to slot within the slotted connection ports so that the printhead integrated circuits of the at least one printhead module are aligned with the respective controller, the printed circuit boards being adjacent one another and each having recessed portions which adjoin recessed portions in the adjacent printed circuit boards, said adjoined recessed portions receiving an electrical connecting member for interconnecting the controllers of adjacent printed circuit boards such that each interconnected controller is able to control the printing operation of the at least two printhead integrated circuits. 2. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein the printed circuit board of the drive electronics is supported by a support frame of the casing. 3. A printhead assembly according to claim 2, further comprising a plurality of longitudinally extending electrical conductors removably mounted to the support frame and arranged to provide power from a power supply to the drive electronics and the at least two printhead integrated circuits. 4. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein power from the plurality of electrical conductors is delivered to the drive electronics and the printhead integrated circuits via the respective flexible printed circuit boards. 5. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein: the at least one printhead module is formed as a unitary arrangement of the at least two printhead integrated circuits, the support member, the at least two flexible printed circuit boards, and at least one fluid distribution member mounting the at least two printhead integrated circuits to the support member; and the support member has at least one longitudinally extending channel for carrying the printing fluid for the printhead integrated circuits and includes a plurality of apertures extending through a wall of the support member arranged so as to direct the printing fluid from the at least one channel to associated nozzles in both, or if more than two, all of the printhead integrated circuits by way of respective ones of the fluid distribution members. 6. A printhead assembly according to claim 1, wherein the support member incorporates lugs which cooperate with recesses of the casing so as to provide said alignment of the connecting portions and connection ports.
