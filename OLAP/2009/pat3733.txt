A self-developing device (1) capable of open-ended development makes use of a special motivational system for selecting which action should be taken on the environment by an associated sensory-motor apparatus (2). For a given candidate action, a motivational module (11) calculates a reward associated with the corresponding values that would be taken by one or more motivational variables that are independent of the nature of the associated sensory-motor apparatus. Preferred motivational variables are dependent on the developmental history of the device (1), and include variables quantifying the predictability, familiarity and stability of sensory-motor variables serving as the inputs to the device (1). The sensory-motor variables represent the status of the external environment and/or the internal resources (3) of the sensory-motor apparatus (2) whose behavior is controlled by the self-developing device (1). Open-ended development is enabled by attributing a reward which is proportional to the rate of change of the history-dependent motivational variables.
