Situated information (SI) is created by adding situation information, which expresses by 5W1H a situation where an information resource becomes effective, to the information resource, and the SI is registered to an SI memory unit. Then, information resource which has situation information fitting the current situation is selected and presented to a user.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A computerized information provision device comprising: a detection unit for detecting information which specifies at least one of an entity, a target of an action of the entity, a spatial situation where the entity is laid, a current temporal situation, an objection of the entity, a motivation of the entity, and a method for actualizing the action of the entity as a current situation of the entity; a creation unit for creating situated information by adding detected situation information to a utilized information resource at the detected situation; a physical memory unit for storing the created situated information; a matching unit for matching the situation information included in the created situated information and the current situation detected by the detection unit; and a presentation unit for presenting an information resource to which situation information fitting the current situation is added. 2. The information provision device of claim 1 further comprising: a prediction unit for predicting transition in a situation of the entity; a matching unit for matching the situation information included in the stored situated information and the predicted-situation; and a presentation unit for presenting an information resource to which situation information fitting the predicted situation is added. 3. The information creation device of claim 1 further comprising: a monitor unit for monitoring an information resource which is utilized by entity utilizing the information resource; wherein the creation unit creates situated information by adding the detected situation information to the utilized information resource observed by the monitoring unit. 4. An information provision device placed in an environment, and accessible to at least one memory unit stored situated information through the internet, wherein the situated information is created by adding situation information to an information resource utilized at a situation, wherein the situation information is detected of which specifies at least one of an entity, a target of an action of the entity, a spatial situation where the entity is laid, a current temporal situation, an objection of the entity, a motivation of the entity, and a method for actualizing the action of the entity as a current situation of the entity, comprising: a download unit for downloading the situated information which corresponds to a location of the information provision device from at least one of the memory unit; and a physical presentation unit for presenting a service to a user utilizing the information provision device using the downloaded situated information. 5. An information provision method, comprising: detecting information which specifies at least one of an entity, a target of an action of the entity, a spatial situation where the entity is laid, a current temporal situation, an objection of the entity, a motivation of the entity, and a method for actualizing the action of the entity as a current situation of the entity; creating situated information by adding detected situation information to a utilized information resource at the detected situation; storing the created situated information in a physical memory device; matching the situation information included in the created situated information and the current situation detected by the detection; and presenting on a display an information resource to which situation information fitting the current situation is added. 6. The information provision method of claim 5 further comprising: predicting transition in a situation of the entity; matching the situation information included in the stored situated information and the predicted situation; and presenting an information resource to which situation information fitting the predicted situation is added. 7. The information creation method of claim 5 further comprising: monitoring an information resource which is viewed by an entity utilizing the information resource; wherein the creating creates situated information by adding the detected situation information to the utilized information resource observed by the monitoring. 8. A computer-readable recording medium wherein a program for a computer is recorded, the program causing the computer to perform: detecting information which specifies at least one of an entity, a target of an action of the entity, a spatial situation where the entity is laid, a current temporal situation, an objection of the entity, a motivation of the entity, and a method for actualizing the action of the entity as a current situation of the entity; creating situated information by adding detected situation information to a utilized information resource at the detected situation; storing the created situated information; matching the situation information included in the created situated information and the current situation detected by the detection; and presenting an information resource to which situation information fitting the current situation is added. 9. The computer-readable recording medium of claim 8, the program causing the computer to further perform: predicting transition in a situation of the entity; matching the situation information included in the stored situated information and the predicted situation; and presenting an information resource to which situation information fitting the predicted situation is added. 10. The computer-readable recording medium of claim 8, the program causing the computer to further perform: monitoring an information resource which is viewed by a entity utilizing the information resource; wherein the creating creates situated information by adding the detected situation information to the utilized information resource observed by the monitoring. 11. An information provision method executed by a computerized information provision device placed in an environment and accessible to at least one memory unit stored situated information through the internet, wherein the situated information is created by adding situation information to an information resource utilized at a situation, wherein the situation information is detected of which specifies at least one of an entity, a target of an action of the entity, a spatial situation where the entity is laid, a current temporal situation, an objection of the entity, a motivation of the entity, and a method for actualizing the action of the entity as a current situation of the entity, comprising: downloading the situated information which corresponds to a location of the information provision device from at least one of the physical memory unit; and presenting a service to a user utilizing the information provision device using the downloaded situated information. 12. A computer-readable recording medium wherein a program for a computer is recorded, wherein the computer is placed in an environment and accessible to at least one memory unit stored situated information through the internet, wherein the situated information is created by adding situation information to an information resource utilized at a situation, wherein the situation information is detected of which specifies at least one of an entity, a target of an action of the entity, a spatial situation where the entity is laid, a current temporal situation, an objection of the entity, a motivation of the entity, and a method for actualizing the action of the entity as a current situation of the entity, the program causing the computer to perform: downloading the situated information which corresponds to a location of the information provision device from at least one of the memory unit; and presenting a service to a user utilizing the information provision device using the downloaded situated information.
