An object recognition system is described that incorporates swarming classifiers with attention mechanisms. The object recognition system includes a cognitive map having a one-to-one relationship with an input image domain. The cognitive map records information that software agents utilize to focus a cooperative swarm's attention on regions likely to contain objects of interest. Multiple agents operate as a cooperative swarm to classify an object in the domain. Each agent is a classifier and is assigned a velocity vector to explore a solution space for object solutions. Each agent records its coordinates in multi-dimensional space that are an observed best solution that the agent has identified, and a global best solution that is used to store the best location among all agents. Each velocity vector thereafter changes to allow the swarm to concentrate on the vicinity of the object and classify the object when a classification level exceeds a preset threshold.
