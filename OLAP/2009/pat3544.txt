A laser processing system implements a method for aligning a probe element (e.g., a probe pin) with a device interface element (e.g., a contact pad of a circuit substrate). First, the laser processing system generates an optical reference beam at one or more predetermined positions to calibrate a reference field. The laser processing system then detects a position of the probe element in the reference field. The laser processing system also determines a relative position of the device interface element in the reference field. Based on the position of the probe element and the device interface element, the laser processing system then initiates alignment of the probe element and the device interface element. In one application, alignment of the probe element and the device interface element further includes contacting the probe element to the device interface element to make an electrical connection.
