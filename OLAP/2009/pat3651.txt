A machine for impregnating a die cast metal part with liquid impregnant comprises an impregnation chamber having liquid impregnant in a lower portion, an opening for ingress and egress of the parts being defined in a side wall of the chamber above the liquid impregnant, a door for sealing the opening, a part holder in the chamber and an elevator for positioning parts above the liquid impregnant during evacuation of the chamber and then immersing the parts in the liquid impregnant during subsequent pressurization of the chamber.
Claims We claim: 1. An assembly for successively impregnating multiple parts or batches of parts with liquid impregnant, the assembly including (a) impregnation apparatus for impregnating a part with liquid impregnant, the impregnation apparatus comprising an impregnation chamber having a top, a bottom and at least one side wall therebetween, the chamber defining a lower portion for receiving a liquid impregnant and an upper portion above the lower portion, a side wall of the chamber defining an opening communicating with the upper portion of the chamber, the opening being above the liquid impregnant in the chamber during impregnation, a door for sealing the opening during evacuation and subsequent pressurization of the chamber for impregnation of the part, a part holder in the chamber for receiving the part to be impregnated, and an elevator for positioning the part holder in the upper portion of the chamber so that the part is held above the liquid impregnant during evacuation of the chamber and then for positioning the part holder in the lower portion of the chamber so that the part is immersed in the liquid impregnant during subsequent pressurization of the chamber, and (b) a centrifuging station for removing excess liquid impregnant off the parts after removal from the impregnation chamber, the centrifuging station being located below the impregnation chamber, wherein the centrifuging station comprises a centrifuge having a centrifuge carrier for carrying the part or parts to be centrifuged, the centrifuge carrier being mounted for rotation about a vertical axis by means of a first bearing above the centrifuge carrier and a second bearing below the centrifuge carrier, wherein the centrifuge is further comprised of housing which surrounds the centrifuge carrier and the housing having a top and bottom wall and a door in its sidewall which closes a housing opening and wherein the centrifuge carrier is further comprised of a top and bottom wall and an opening in a side wall which is defined by a bottom lip and wherein the parts are fed through the housing opening and into the side wall opening of the centrifuge carrier and the parts are prevented from sliding off the centrifuge carrier during centrifugation by the bottom lip. 2. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the centrifuging station is adapted to rotate the parts at a rate of at least about 200 rpm. 3. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the assembly includes a washing station for washing the surfaces of the part after centrifuging and a curing station for curing the liquid impregnant inside the part. 4. The assembly of claim 3, wherein the assembly includes multiple curing stations.
