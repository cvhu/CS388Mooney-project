A combination of a FOUP (front opening unified pod) system and a reticle system utilized for the transport of wafers and a reticle system, the latter of which are used for transporting reticles from a first fabrication site to a further site at another location, and which provides for a unified system enabling the automated and trackable delivery of the reticles between these sites. Provided is a modified FOUP base structure, which is adapted to retain a reticle and to be able to employ existing equipment in a fabrication site which only necessitates a minimal modification of the equipment in order to render the latter universally adaptable to the combination of the systems.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of combining a front opening unified pod (FOUP) system and a reticle system for the transport of semiconductor wafers between processing sites, said method comprising: modifying a FOUP so as to facilitate said FOUP transporting at least one reticle carrying a semiconductor wafer between said sites, said modifying including: providing an adapter for said at least one reticle, said adapter having a plate member which is insertable into said FOUP, and said plate member including upstanding guide pins arrayed to hold wafers in predetermined positions on said at least one reticle during transport in said FOUP, said adapter facilitating insertion and transport of said at least one reticle in said FOUP; and, providing an interface stocker system for transporting said reticles in a Reticle Storage Pod (RSP) to said adapter for supplying said reticles to said FOUP; providing an overhead transport structure (OHT) for positioning said FOUP; providing a further overhead transport structure (RSP OHT) for positioning said Reticle Storage Pod (RSP) proximate said FOUP; providing a structure for introducing said Reticle Storage Pods into said FOUP and for closing said FOUP, said structure including sensors for providing information and control for the loading and unloading of said Reticle Storage Pods (RSPs) into and from said front opening unified pod (FOUP); and wherein said FOUP including said Reticle Storage Pod which includes said at least one reticle (RSP FOUP) is conveyed over a conveying structure for transporting to a specified manufacturing or processing site.
