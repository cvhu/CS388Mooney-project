In a robot hand , at least one finger link thereof is configured to comprise a first member , a second member adhered to a surface of the first member and a third member covering at least the second member and a rigidity of the second member is made smaller than the rigidities of the first member and the third member. With this, the flexibility of the finger is improved by the second member, thereby increasing the contact area between the third member and a held object, so that the object can be securely held.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A robot hand having a finger comprising finger links and finger joints interconnecting the links, wherein at least one of the finger links comprises; a base to which a force sensor is attached; a first member connected to the base through the force sensor; a second member adhered to a surface of the first member; a third member covering at least the second member; and a fourth member adhered to a part of a surface of the third member, wherein the fourth member is interconnected with the force sensor through a connector.
