A process for preweakening the inside of an automotive trim piece cover layer of various constructions by use of a laser beam so as to enable formation of an air bag deployment opening in the trim piece formed at the time the air bag deploys. The laser beam impinges the inside surface of the cover to form a groove scoring or spaced perforations to form a preweakening pattern. A robot arm may be used to move a laser generator so as to form the preweakening pattern. The laser beam can be controlled in accordance with sensed conditions to achieve accurate preweakening, and may also be used to trim substrate panels and to perform other cutting operations.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. An apparatus for preweakening an automotive interior trim piece having a thin compliant plastic outer cover layer, said preweakening extending along a predetermined generally U-shaped pattern overlying an air bag installation to be mounted behind said interior trim piece at a particular location, said preweakening pattern enabling formation of an air bag deployment opening in said trim piece by severing of said cover layer along said pattern by outward pressure exerted on said cover layer by an air bag deploying from said air bag installation mounted on the inside of said trim piece, said apparatus including: a laser beam scoring arrangement generating a laser beam and directing said laser beam at an inner surface of said cover layer and along said predetermined pattern so as to produce a preweakening scoring therein extending into said cover along said predetermined pattern; and scoring control programmed to cause said laser beam to produce said preweakening scoring of said plastic outer cover layer comprised of a series of repeating partial penetrations extending into the inside of said outer cover layer and spaced apart along said U-shaped preweakening pattern enabling formation of said deployment opening in said outer cover layer, said partial penetrations produced by said scoring control programmed to cyclically vary the intensity of said laser beam so as to form said series of repeating partial penetrations forming a varying depth scoring into said outer cover layer extending at least partially along said U-shaped pattern. 2. Apparatus for preweakening an automotive interior trim piece covering an air bag installation, said trim piece having a thin compliant plastic outer cover layer, said preweakening including a scoring of said outer cover layer extending in a predetermined generally U-shaped pattern enabling formation of an air bag deployment opening in said trim piece by severing of said outer cover layer along said pattern by outward pressure exerted on said outer cover layer by an air bag deploying from said, air bag installation to be mounted behind said trim piece; said apparatus including: a laser beam generator generating a laser beam directed at an inner inside surface of said outer cover layer, said trim piece supported by fixturing included in said apparatus, a laser beam scoring control programmed to direct said laser beam along said predetermined generally U-shaped pattern enabling formation of said deployment opening to be formed in said outer cover layer and said scoring control also programmed to cause said laser beam from said laser beam generator to produce repeating partial penetrations forming a stepped depth scoring extending into said inside of said outer cover layer along said predetermined generally U-shaped pattern; a sensor sensing the remaining thickness of said trim piece cover along said scoring during said laser beam scoring of said outer cover layer and producing corresponding output signals; said scoring control also programmed to control said laser beam scoring in response to said sensor output signals so as to produce a predetermined remaining thickness of said outer cover layer beyond said scoring such that said remaining thickness of said cover layer along said predetermined pattern is sufficiently thin to be reliably severed by deployment of said air bag.
