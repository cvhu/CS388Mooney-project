A cassette stocker includes a plurality of cassette storage shelves positioned adjacent a cleanroom wall above a cassette docking station, and a cassette mover to carry a cassette between the shelves and the docking station. An interstation transfer apparatus includes an overhead support beam and a transfer arm adapted to carry a cassette between processing stations.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system comprising: a first processing station including a first docking station, a first frame, a first plurality of cassette storage shelves, and a first cassette mover mounted on the first frame to carry a cassette between the first plurality of shelves and the first docking station; a second processing station including a second docking station, a second frame, a second plurality of cassette storage shelves, and a second cassette mover mounted on the second frame to carry a cassette between the second plurality of shelves and the second docking station; and an interstation cassette mover adapted to transport a cassette between processing stations, the interstation cassette mover comprising: a first wafer cassette support and transport mechanism adapted to allow wafer cassettes to be delivered to and retrieved from at least the first processing station; a second wafer cassette support and transport mechanism adapted to allow wafer cassettes to be delivered to and retrieved from at least the second processing station; and a rotary handoff mechanism adapted to transfer a wafer cassette between the first and second wafer cassette support and transport mechanisms. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein each of the first and second wafer cassette support and transport mechanisms is adapted to support an end effector. 3. A method comprising: providing a system having: a first processing station including a first docking station, a first frame, a first plurality of cassette storage shelves, and a first cassette mover mounted on the first frame to carry a cassette between the first plurality of shelves and the first docking station; a second processing station including a second docking station, a second frame, a second plurality of cassette storage shelves, and a second cassette mover mounted on the second frame to carry a cassette between the second plurality of shelves and the second docking station; and an interstation cassette mover adapted to transport a cassette between the first and second processing stations; delivering a cassette from the first processing station to a first wafer cassette support and transport mechanism of the interstation cassette mover; moving the cassette from the first wafer cassette support and transport mechanism to a second wafer cassette support and transport mechanism of the interstation cassette mover with a rotary handoff mechanism; and delivering the wafer cassette to the second processing station. 4. The method of claim 3 wherein moving the cassette from the first wafer cassette support and transport mechanism to a second wafer cassette support and transport mechanism of the interstation cassette mover comprises rotating the wafer cassette. 5. A system comprising: a first cassette mover coupled to a first processing station and adapted to deliver cassettes to and remove cassettes from a docking station of the first processing station; a second cassette mover coupled to a second processing station and adapted to deliver cassettes to and remove cassettes from a docking station of the second processing station; and an interstation cassette mover adapted to transport cassettes between the first cassette mover and the second cassette mover, the interstation cassette mover comprising: a first wafer cassette support and transport mechanism adapted to allow wafer cassettes to be delivered to and retrieved from at least the first processing station; a second wafer cassette support and transport mechanism adapted to allow wafer cassettes to be delivered to and retrieved from at least the second processing station; and a rotary handoff mechanism adapted to transfer a wafer cassette between the first and second wafer cassette support and transport mechanisms. 6. The system of claim 5 wherein each of the first and second wafer cassette support and transport mechanisms is adapted to support an end effector.
