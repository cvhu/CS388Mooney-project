The present invention provides polynucleotides encoding potassium channels as well as methods of using the potassium channels to treat and diagnose diabetes and a predisposition for diabetes.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An isolated polynucleotide encoding a potassium channel polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10, with the proviso that the polypeptide is not SEQ ID NO: 9. 2. The polynucleotide of claim 1, wherein the potassium channel polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO:2. 3. The isolated polynucleotide of claim 1, wherein the potassium channel polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO:1. 4. A cell comprising a recombinant expression cassette, the expression cassette comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide encoding a potassium channel polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10, with the proviso that the polypeptide is not SEQ ID NO: 9. 5. The cell of claim 4, wherein the polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO:2.
