An electronic module includes electronic circuitry and first and second connection mechanisms, both operationally connected to the electronic circuitry, for mounting the module in a larger electronic device by different respective methods. Preferably, the first connection mechanism is a robotic connection mechanism such as a BGA with one or more solder balls and the second connection mechanism is a manual connection mechanism such as a plug with one or more electrically conducting pads, both mechanisms being for mounting the module on a PCB.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electronic module, comprising: (a) electronic circuitry; (b) a first connection mechanism, operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by robotic mounting; and (c) a second connection mechanism, operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by manual mounting; wherein mounting using only said first connection mechanism suffices to render the electronic module fully operational; wherein mounting using only said second connection mechanism suffices to render the electronic module fully operational; wherein said first connection mechanism includes a first plurality of electrical contacts; wherein said second connection mechanism includes a second plurality of electrical contacts equal in number to said first plurality of electrical contacts; and wherein the electronic module further comprises: (d) for each electrical contact of the first plurality, a direct electrical connection to a corresponding electrical contact of the second plurality. 2. An electronic module, comprising: (a) electronic circuitry; (b) a first connection mechanism, operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by a first method; and (c) a second connection mechanism, including at least one electrically conducting pad, and operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by a second method different from said first method; wherein mounting using only said first connection mechanism suffices to render the electronic module hilly operational; and wherein mounting using only said second connection mechanism suffices to render the electronic module hilly operational. 3. An electronic module, comprising: (a) electronic circuitry; (b) a first connection mechanism, directly operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by a first method; and (c) a second connection mechanism, directly operationally connected to said electronic circuitry, for mounting of the electronic module on a printed circuit board by a second method different from said first method; wherein mounting using only one of said connection mechanisms suffices to render the electronic module fully operational; wherein said first connection mechanism includes a first plurality of electrical contacts; wherein said second connection mechanism includes a second plurality of electrical contacts equal in number to said first plurality of electrical contacts; and wherein the electronic module further comprises: (d) for each electrical contact of the first plurality, a direct electrical connection to a corresponding electrical contact of the second plurality.
