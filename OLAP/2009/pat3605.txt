An expandable storage library for storing digital storage media, such as storage tapes or disks is provided. The library includes a base unit and robotic system to which additional expansion units may be added. Several expansion units may be installed in the library with the base unit so that the robotic system can access media storage racks in any of the expansion units or in the base unit. Doors on the base unit and expansion unit may be interlocked together to function as a single door. A Z pole guide on the base unit may be extended by adding expansion guide poles that guide the movement of the robotic system through the library.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An expandable storage library for removable data storage articles, comprising: a rack; a base unit assembled to the rack, the base unit including an enclosure, at least one media drive, a data storage article rack, a robotic system for storing and accessing a plurality of data storage articles in the data storage article rack, and a processor for controlling the robotic system that records the storage locations of the data storage articles in the data storage article rack for subsequent retrieval; an expansion module having a supplemental media rack that is assembled to the enclosure by sliding the module onto at least one guide rail on the rack and without further disassembly of the enclosure; a door on the enclosure and a supplemental door on the module that is assembled to the door on the enclosure when the expansion module is assembled to the base unit, a first engagement feature on the door and a second engagement feature on the supplemental door, wherein the first and second engagement features are engaged to join the supplemental door to the door; and an interface between the expansion module and the base unit that enables the robotic system and processor to store and retrieve data storage articles that may be stored in the data storage article rack or supplemental data storage article rack. 2. The expandable storage library of claim 1 wherein a removable panel is removed from a vertically facing wall of the enclosure. 3. The expandable storage library of claim 2 wherein the removable panel is a floor panel of the base unit, the floor panel is assembled to the expansion module on a bottom side of the expansion module. 4. The expandable storage library of claim 1 wherein the expansion module has an open side on the side of the expansion module facing away from the base unit and wherein the removable panel is removed from the base unit and assembled to the open side of the expansion module. 5. An expandable storage library for removable data storage articles, comprising: a rack; a base unit installed in the rack, the base unit having a base enclosure, at least one media drive, a data storage rack, a robotic system for storing and accessing a plurality of data storage articles in the data storage rack, a processor for controlling the robotic system that records the storage location of the data storage articles in the data storage article rack for subsequent retrieval, and a first engagement feature on the base unit; an expansion module having a supplemental media rack that is assembled to an expansion enclosure, wherein the expansion module slides into engagement with the base unit, and wherein a second engagement feature is provided on the expansion unit, wherein the first and second engagement features are engaged to horizontally align the expansion unit with the base unit as the expansion unit slides into engagement with the base unit; a base guide rail in the base unit that guides the robotic system as it moves vertically within the base unit, and an expansion guide rail that guides the robotic system as it moves vertically within the expansion module, wherein the base guide rail and the expansion guide rail are joined together by a bracket that engages a bottom end of the base guide rail and a top end of the expansion guide rail, and wherein the base unit guide rail and expansion unit guide rail are hollow tubular members and the expansion bracket has a semi-spherical top portion on a top end that is received by the base guide rail and a semi-spherical bottom portion on a bottom end that is received by the expansion guide rail; and an interface between the expansion module and the base unit that enables the robotic system and processor to store and retrieve data storage articles that may be stored in the data storage article rack or supplemental media rack. 6. The expandable storage library of claim 5 wherein the expansion bracket is a flexible member. 7. An expandable storage library for removable data storage articles, comprising: a rack; a base unit installed in the rack, the base unit having a base enclosure, at least one media drive, a data storage rack, a robotic system for storing and accessing a plurality of data storage articles in the data storage rack, a processor for controlling the robotic system that records the storage location of the data storage articles in the data storage article rack for subsequent retrieval, and a first engagement feature on the base unit; an expansion module having a supplemental media rack that is assembled to an expansion enclosure, wherein the expansion enclosure is supported by at least one set of side rails that are secured to a set of front tracks and at least one set of rear support brackets that are secured to a set of rear tracks, the rear support brackets each having a receptacle for receiving the side rails in a range of locations, and wherein the expansion module slides into engagement with the base unit, and wherein a second engagement feature is provided on the expansion unit, wherein the first and second engagement features are engaged to horizontally align the expansion unit with the base unit as the expansion unit slides into engagement with the base unit; and an interface between the expansion module and the base unit that enables the robotic system and processor to store and retrieve data storage articles that may be stored in the data storage article rack or supplemental data storage article rack.
