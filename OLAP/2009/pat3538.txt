A break-away mounting system for a continuous-motion, high-speed position conveyor system is disclosed. A support cradle may be suspended from a conveyor belt such that the support cradle maintains a fixed position and orientation relative to at least one point on the conveyor belt without inducing appreciable stress on the conveyor belt, the support cradle, or the coupling between the conveyor belt and the support cradle. The mount may include a leading rotatable bearing attached to the support cradle which may releasably engage a first key attached to the conveyor belt, the rotatable bearing adapted to accommodate rotational forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt. The mount may also include a slide bearing attached to the support cradle which may releasably engage a second key attached to the conveyor belt, the slide bearing adapted to accommodate longitudinal forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method comprising: driving a continuously moving conveyor system including a conveyor belt continuously moving along a transport path, the transport path having at least one bend; attaching a substrate carrier to a support cradle suspended from the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle being adapted to maintain a fixed position relative to at least one point on the continuously moving conveyor belt without inducing appreciable stress on any one of the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle, and a coupling between the continuously moving conveyor belt and the support cradle; and driving the substrate carrier attached to the continuously moving conveyor belt around the at least one bend. 2. A method comprising: driving a continuously moving conveyor system including a conveyor belt continuously moving along a transport path, the transport path having at least one bend; and attaching a substrate carrier to a support cradle suspended from the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle being adapted to maintain a fixed position relative to at least one point on the continuously moving conveyor belt without inducing appreciable stress on any one of the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle, and a coupling between the continuously moving conveyor belt and the support cradle. 3. The method of claim 2 further including coupling a rotatable bearing of the support cradle to a first key attached to the conveyor belt, the rotatable bearing being adapted to accommodate rotational forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt. 4. The method of claim 2 further comprising detaching the substrate carrier from the support cradle on the conveyor belt. 5. A method comprising: driving a continuously moving conveyor system including a conveyor belt continuously moving along a transport path, the transport path having at least one bend; and attaching a substrate carrier to a support cradle on the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle being adapted to maintain a fixed position and orientation relative to at least one point on the continuously moving conveyor belt without inducing appreciable stress on any one of the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle, and a coupling between the continuously moving conveyor belt and the support cradle further including coupling a slide bearing of the support cradle to a first key attached to the conveyor belt, the slide bearing being adapted to accommodate longitudinal forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt. 6. A method comprising: driving a continuously moving conveyor system including a conveyor belt continuously moving along a transport path, the transport path having at least one bend; and attaching a substrate carrier to a support cradle on the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle being adapted to maintain a fixed position and orientation relative to at least one point on the continuously moving conveyor belt without inducing appreciable stress on any one of the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle, and a coupling between the continuously moving conveyor belt and the support cradle further including coupling a slide bearing of the support cradle to a first key attached to the conveyor belt, the slide bearing being adapted to accommodate longitudinal forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt further including coupling a rotatable bearing of the support cradle to a second key attached to the conveyor belt, the rotatable bearing being adapted to accommodate rotational forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt. 7. A method comprising: driving a continuously moving conveyor system including a conveyor belt continuously moving along a transport path, the transport path having at least one bend; and attaching a substrate carrier to a support cradle on the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle being adapted to maintain a fixed position and orientation relative to at least one point on the continuously moving conveyor belt without inducing appreciable stress on any one of the continuously moving conveyor belt, the support cradle, and a coupling between the continuously moving conveyor belt and the support cradle further including coupling a rotatable bearing of the support cradle to a first key attached to the conveyor belt, the rotatable bearing being adapted to accommodate rotational forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt further including coupling a slide bearing of the support cradle to a second key attached to the conveyor belt, the slide bearing being adapted to accommodate longitudinal forces applied to the support cradle by the conveyor belt.
