A coupling device includes a first support member which is connected to the arm of a robot and which supports a second support member for universal tilting and axial movement from an aligned normal position. The second support member supports robotic tooling, and a set of springs and ball members bias the support members to the normal position. An electrical control circuit is effective to stop movement of the robot arm in response to minute tilting or axial movement of the second support member in the event the tooling or article carried by the tooling is accidentally hit or overloaded.
