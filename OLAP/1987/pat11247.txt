An articulatable robot has a forearm and robotic wrist, the wrist having plural members mounted on plural axes of rotation. A laser generator is connected through a light pipe system to the robot forearm, distal to the robotic wrist, and a continuous laser beam pathway is established through the forearm and robotic wrist, the beam pathway extending colinearly with the plural rotation axes of the wrist members.
Claims We claim: 1. An improved laser robot, wherein a plurality of robotic members are joined together and are relatively movable by a power robotic drive means, said robotic members including a hollow elongate forearm, having opposite ends, with an articulatable robotic wrist carried at one end, said robotic wrist having a plurality of wrist members mounted on plural axes of rotation, said forearm also including a plurality of concentric drive tubes, rotatably carried therein on a common forearm axis, and drivingly connected to a power wrist drive means and to said plurality of wrist members, wherein the improvement comprises: a laser generator; a light pipe system, linking said laser generator to an end of said elongate forearm distal to said robotic wrist; and a continuous laser beam pathway through said forearm and said robotic wrist, said beam pathway extending collinearly with said plural rotation axes of said wrist members. 2. The laser robot of claim 1, further including a laser tooling unit mounted on said robotic wrist. 3. The laser robot of claim 1, wherein at least two of said plural axes of rotation are obliquely oriented to one another. 4. The laser robot of claim 2, wherein said laser tooling unit comprises, in part, a laser beam focus assembly.
