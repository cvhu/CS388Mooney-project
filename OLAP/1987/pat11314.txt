This disclosure relates to automated manufacturing apparatus and systems. The invention is provided to an integrated carousel system to provide selected end-of-arm tooling for use in a laser material processing system in a laser-robotic, work cell.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A carousel tooling apparatus comprising: a base member adapted to be mounted onto a wrist assembly of an industrial manipulator such that rotational movement is imparted to said base member thereby said base member having a first tooling station thereon and at least a second tooling station thereon wherein the rotation movement of said base member, as effected by said wrist assembly, selectively presents each of said tooling stations to a terminal location of a laser beam delivery system; said first tooling station comprising means defining a first set of focussing optics and means for coupling said means for defining the first set of focussing optics with said laser beam delivery system wherein a predetermined focal length, spot size or intensity of said beam is established; and said second tooling station comprising means defining a second set of focussing optics and means for coupling said means for defining the second set of focussing optics with said integral laser beam delivery system; said means for coupling the tooling station optics with the terminal location of a laser beam delivery system comprising a conduit having a normally biased closed cover means which is rotatable to an open position through interaction with the laser beam delivery system, said conduit defining a counterbore-groove therein, the laser beam delivery system including at the terminal location thereof a vertically movable transmission tube size for insertion into the counterbore groove and means operably associated with the transmission tube for effecting the vertical movement thereof. 2. In combination with an integrated robot-laser comprising: a robotic system having one or more mechanical joints defining at least in part a fixed axis of motion and a second axis of motion, which axes of motion define a contoured path through the robotic system's geometric range of motion, wherein each of said mechanical joints defines in part a frame member; and a wrist assembly adapted to mountably receive thereon an end effector or the like to impart at least rotational movement thereof; and an integral laser beam delivery system for the delivery of a beam along any point within said geometric range of motion to a terminal location proximate said wrist assembly, said integral laser beam delivery system including a plurality of optical joints and tubular members disposed between adjacent optical joints and through which tubular members the beam passes as it travels from optical joint to optical joint; a carousel tooling apparatus comprising; a base member adapted to be mounted onto said wrist assembly such that rotational movement is imparted thereto, said base member having a first tooling station thereon and at least a second tooling station thereon wherein the rotation movement of said base member, as effected by said wrist assembly, selectively presents each of said tooling stations to said terminal location of said laser beam delivery system; said first tooling station comprising means defining a first set of focussing optics and means for coupling said means for defining the first set of focussing optics with said integral laser beam delivery system wherein a predetermined focal length, spot size or intensity of said beam is established; and said second tooling station comprising means defining a second set of focussing optics and means for coupling said means for defining the second set of focussing optics with said integral laser beam delivery system.
