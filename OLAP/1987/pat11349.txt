An axial lead forming machine is presented which is capable of trimming, shaping, and electrically verifying the characteristics of axial components under computer control. Two die cutting and bending assemblies are incrementally moved horizontally over the wire leads of an axial component, which is suspended between them. A set of counters, lead screws, and two electric motors initially hold the two die assemblies in a known position defined as a "home" location. By correlating the number of leads per inch on the lead screws and counting the number of rotations of the electric motor, the lead forming mechanism is capable of communicating to a computer the exact location of the hammer, anvil and cutting edge of the die assemblies so that a programmable setting of the trimming and shaping of the axial leads may be accomplished automatically under computer direction.
