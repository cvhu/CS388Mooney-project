A reconfigurable toy which may be used to selectively simulate a robotic humanoid figure and a rock configuration. The toy has head, arm and leg members which are rotatably coupled to a torso member. Each member has a surface simulating part of a robotic humanoid figure and a rock simulating surface. The toy may be folded into a compact configuration by rotating the members until they are positioned so that only the rock simulating surfaces of the members are visible and a rock configuration is simulated such as a boulder resting on a supporting surface. The toy may then be unfolded or reconfigured to simulate a robotic humanoid figure supported on two leg members.
Claims We claim: 1. A reconfigurable toy comprising: a hollow torso member having a slot at one end thereof, a plurality of apertures at both sides thereof, an outside surface simulating a torso of a robotic humanoid figure and an outside surface simulating a rock surface, said hollow torso member having a plurality of webs with apertures and two extensions with slots attached to inside surfaces thereof; a head retainer rotatably mounted inside said hollow torso member, said head retainer having side pins rotatably engaging at least two of said apertures of said webs and a pin extending through said slot of said hollow torso member, said pin having a ball member attached to the end thereof and disposed outside said hollow torso member; a Y-shaped leg and arm retainer mounted inside said hollow torso member, said leg and arm retainer having (a) a horizontal member extending through one of said apertures at each side of said hollow torso member with ball members attached to the ends thereof and disposed outside said torso member, (b) a plate engaging said slots of said two extensions of said hollow torso member and (c) two horizontal extensions engaging at least two of said apertures of said webs, each of said two horizontal extensions passing through one of said apertures at one of said sides of said hollow torso member and having a disk-shaped member attached thereto and a ball member attached to the end thereof and disposed outside said hollow torso member; a head member having a surface simulating a face of a robotic humanoid figure and a surface simulating a rock surface, said head member being rotatably coupled to said head retainer by said ball member of said head retainer which operably engages a cylindrical bore and spherical socket in said head member; two arm members each having a surface simulating an arm of a robotic humanoid figure and a surface simulating a rock surface, each of said arm members being rotatably coupled to said Y-shaped leg and arm retainer by one of said ball members attached to said two horizontal extensions which operably engages a cylindrical bore and spherical socket in each of said arm members; and two leg members each having a surface simulating a leg of a robotic humanoid figure and a surface simulating a rock surface, each of said leg members being rotatably coupled to said Y-shaped leg and arm retainer by one of said ball members attached to said horizontal member which operably engages a cylindrical bore and spherical socket in each of said leg members. 2. The reconfigurable toy of claim 1 wherein each of said head, arm and leg members has mating edges, each of said mating edges of one of said members capable of operably engaging one of said mating edges of another of said members positioned adjacent to said one of said members. 3. A reconfigurable toy comprising: a hollow torso member having a rock simulating surface and a surface simulating a torso of a robotic humanoid figure; a head member rotatably coupled to said torso member, said head member having mating edges, a rock simulating surface and a surface simulating a face of a robotic humanoid figure; two arm members rotatably coupled to said torso member, each of said two arm members having mating edges, a rock simulating surface and a surface simulating an arm of a robotic humanoid figure; two leg members rotatably coupled to said torso member, each of said two leg members having mating edges, a rock simulating surface and a surface simulating a leg of a robotic humanoid figure; first means for rotatably coupling said head member to said torso member so that said head member is capable of being selectively moved to at least first and second positions with respect to said two arm members and said two leg members, said first position of said head member disposing said head member so that said surface simulating a face of a robotic humanoid figure is visible and said mating edges of said head member are disposed away from said mating edges of said arm members, said second position of said head member disposing said head member so that each of said mating edges thereof operably engages an adjacent one of said mating edges of one of said arm members, said first means including a head retainer rotatably mounted inside said torso member; and second means for rotatably coupling said two arm members and said two leg members to said torso member so that said arm and leg members are capable of being selectively moved to at least first and second positions with respect to each other and said head member, said first position of said arm and leg members disposing said arm and leg members so that said surfaces simulating arms and legs of a robotic humanoid figure are visible and said mating edges of said arm members are disposed away from said mating edges of said leg members, said second position of said arm and leg members disposing said arm and leg members so that each of said mating edges of one of said arm members operably engages and adjacent one of said mating edges of said head member and an adjacent one of said mating edges of one of said leg members, and each of said mating edges of one of said leg members operably engages an adjacent one of said mating edges of one of said arm members and an adjacent one of said mating edges of the other of said leg members, said reconfigurable toy simulating a robotic humanoid figure when said head, arm and leg members are disposed in said first position and a rock configuration when said head, arm and leg members are disposed in said second position, said second means including a Y-shaped leg and arm retainer mounted inside said torso member.
