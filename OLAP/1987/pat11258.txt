A SCARA type robotic manipulator apparatus including a base supporting first and second independently operable drive motors, toothed belts engaging toothed gears for rotating primary and secondary arms in response to the first and second drive motors respectively, and adjustable bidirectional belt tensioning assemblies associated with the belts to preload the belts to provide stable, repeatable operation of the robot arms.
Claims I claim: 1. In a drive system having a first toothed gear, a second toothed gear and an endless toothed belt means operatively coupling the toothed gears for rotation in response to a drive motor means, the combination of a bidirectional belt tensioning means, comprising, a U-shaped support member having first and second rotatable roller means affixed at either end of said U-shaped supported member, said U-shaped support member being slidably positioned relative to said first toothed gear such that said first toothed gear is located within the open end of said U-shaped support member, said first and second rotatable roller means contacting the external surface of said endless toothed belt means on either side of said first toothed gear, wherein both said first and second rotatable roller means contacting the external surface of said endless tooth belt means exert simultaneously increasing or decreasing tension on said belt means, and adjustment means coupled to said U-shaped support member to position said U-shaped member relative to said first toothed gear for simultaneously positioning said first and second rotatable roller means to control the tension of said endless toothed belt means. 2. A robotic manipulator apparatus comprising: a base supporting first and second independently operable drive means; a primary arm rotatably supported by said base and means coupling said primary arm to said first drive means for driving said primary arm from said first drive means for rotation through one planar space; a secondary arm having one end rotatably carried by the end of said primary arm opposite said base for rotation through another planar space, translationally displaced from said first planar space; means coupling said second drive means to drive said secondary arm independently of said primary arm, said coupling means extending from said base through said first arm to said one end of said secondary arm; each of said first and second independently operable drive means including a drive motor means having a first toothed gear affixed to the drive shaft, each of said means for coupling including a second toothed gear, a first endless toothed belt means operatively coupling the toothed gears for rotating said primary arm in response to the drive motor means of said first operable drive means, a second endless toothed belt means operatively coupling the toothed gears for rotating said secondary arm in response to the drive motor means of said second operable means, and first and second adjustably positioned bidirectional belt tensioning means operatively associated with said first and second toothed belt means to control the tension of each of said belts, each of said adjustably positioned bidirectional belt tensioning means including; a U-shaped support member having first and second rotatable roller means affixed at either end of said U-shaped support member, said U-shaped support member being slidably positioned relative to said first toothed gear such that said first toothed gear is located within the open end of said U-shaped support member, said first and second rotatable roller means contacting the external surface of said endless toothed belt means on either side of said first tooth gear, wherein both said first and second rotatable roller means contacting the external surface of said endless tooth belt means exert simultaneously increasing or decreasing tension on said belt means, and adjustment means coupled to said U-shaped support member to position said U-shaped support member relative to said first toothed gear for simultaneously positioning said first and second rotatable roller means to control the tension of said endless tooth belt means.
