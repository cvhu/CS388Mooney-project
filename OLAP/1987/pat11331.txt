Arrangements for detecting the presence of an opaque object in an area, such as a person in a robotic work cell. Multiple light sources, light reflecting surfaces, light boxes with hole patterns or fiber optic light sources are spaced around the perimeter of the area and imaged by a camera. The change of the camera signal from its normal condition is used to interrupt power to safeguard personnel and/or machinery.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for training a robot safety system of light curtains comprising the steps of: recording time intervals within a camera frame reporting light signals above a set threshold; removing from said time intervals set time interval reports that do not disappear when a light curtain source is turn off; turning on sequentially parts of the light curtain to resolve ambiguities; and programming an alarm criterion from recorded data and messages to be received from a robot controller means. 2. An method as defined in claim 1, wherein said light curtain source comprises a plurality of light sources.
