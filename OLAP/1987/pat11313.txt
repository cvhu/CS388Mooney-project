An articulatable robotic machine has a forearm and wrist unit capable of handling an internal laser beam received at the aft end of the forearm and exiting at the forward end of the forearm through the wrist unit tooling plate. A laser marker galvohead and collimator are affixed to the tooling plate of the wrist, and a laser generator is affixed to the forearm of the robot machine and provided with a laser beam system to direct a laser beam into the aft end of the laser arm. The output pattern galvohead may be manipulated to a variety of predetermined positions on a workpiece.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an articulatable robotic structure, a robotic marking system, comprising: a laser forearm, movable on said robotic structure, having a forward end, an aft end, and an internal forearm beam path connecting said forward and aft ends; a laser beam source means connected to said aft end of said forearm for providing a laser beam traveling said beam path from said aft end to said forward end; laser wrist means carried at said forward end of said forearm for receiving and manipulating said beam, said wrist means including a tooling plate and means for moving said tooling plate with respect to said forearm; a laser marker galvo head affixed to said tooling plate, said head including galvo head means for moving said laser beam through a predetermined output pattern with respect to said tooling plate; first control means for moving said tooling plate through predetermined spatial movements; and second control means for driving said galvo head means. 2. The robotic marking system of claim 1, wherein said laser beam source means includes: a laser generator carried on said forearm; and a laser beam conductor connecting said generator to said aft end of said forearm. 3. The robotic marking system of claim 2, wherein said laser generator has an exit path parallel to said forearm beam path, and wherein said beam travels said exit path in a direction generally toward said aft end of said forearm, and wherein said laser beam conductor includes means for reversing the beam travel direction from said exit path, into said internal forearm beam path.
