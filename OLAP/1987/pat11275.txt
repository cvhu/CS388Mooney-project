Apparatus for automatically transferring a cassette of semiconductor wafers from one "clean" room to a second "clean" room across an area that may be less clean. The system includes an elevator in each room where a load is manually positioned in a load stall, and is then withdrawn automatically to an elevator and moved to a different elevation and transferred to an enclosed horizontal conveyor at that elevation which spans the distance between the "clean" rooms. The load then moves on a driven cart which straddles, and is magnetically coupled to an enclosed driver cart. The conveyor and the elevator stations are pressurized with clean air to maintain the necessary cleanliness for the wafer processing operation.
