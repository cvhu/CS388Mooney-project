A dual mode robotic mechanical hand is disclosed in a preferred embodiment with one fixed and two opposed articulated fingers, each with a base and a tip digit. In a first mode, the two independently controlled articulated fingers are operated to soft grip an object against the fixed finger. In a second mode, the base digits are anchored so that only the tip digits rotate, allowing smaller size objects to be conveniently manipulated. The preferred embodiment is designed for particular compactness and simplicity, as well.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: 1. A dual mode robotic mechanical hand for gripping and releasing objects, comprising; a frame, an articulated finger joined to said frame including a base digit pivoted to said frame and a tip digit pivoted to said base digit, said articulated finger being operable in a first mode by a gripping cable and an oppositely acting releasing cable, said gripping cable being adapted to move said finger into a gripping position around an object by initially pivoting said base digit relative to said frame until said base digit engages said object and then pivoting said tip digit pivot relative to said base digit until said tip digit engages said object, said releasing cable being adapted to move said finger into a release position by pivoting said tip and base digits oppositely to said gripping cable, tensioning means acting between said frame and said release cable to continually retract said releasing cable so as to move said articulated finger into said release position, a first controllable power means to operate said gripping cable by retracting said gripping cable to move said finger in opposition to said tensioning means into said gripping position and by playing out said gripping cable so that said tensioning means may retract said releasing cable and move said articulated finger into said release position, a braking cable adapted to anchor said base digit relative to said frame so that said articulated finger is operable in a second mode where said tip digit alone will pivot relative to said anchored base digit as said gripping cable is operated, and, a second controllable power means to operate said braking cable, said second power means working in conjunction with said first power means when said finger is operating in said first mode by tracking said first power means so that said braking cable is maintained without substantial slack or tension, said second power means serving to hold said braking cable fast to thereby anchor said base digit relative to said frame when it is desired to operate said articulated finger in said second mode. 2. A three fingered, dual mode robotic mechanical hand for gripping and releasing objects, comprising; a frame, a fixed finger extending from said frame, a pair of articulated fingers joined to said frame and opposed to said fixed finger, each articulated finger including a base digit pivoted to said frame and a tip digit pivoted to said base digit, each of said articulated fingers being operable in a first mode by a gripping cable and an oppositely acting releasing cable, said gripping cables being adapted to move each of said articulated fingers into a gripping position so as to grip an object in cooperation with the other articulated finger against said fixed finger by initially pivoting said base digits relative to said frame until said base digits engage said object and then pivoting said tip digits pivot relative to said base digits until said tip digits engage said object, said releasing cables being adapted to move each of said articulated fingers into a release position by pivoting said tip and base digits oppositely to said gripping cables, tensioning means acting between said frame and said releasing cables to continually retract said releasing cables so as to move said articulated fingers into said release position, a first controllable power means to operate said gripping cables by retracting said gripping cables to move said articulated fingers in opposition to said tensioning means into said gripping position and by playing out said gripping cables so that said tensioning means may retract said releasing cable and move said articulated fingers into said release position, a braking cable adapted to anchor each of said base digits relative to said frame so that said articulated fingers are operable in a second mode where said tip digits alone will pivot relative to said base digits as said gripping cables are operated, and, a second controllable power means to operate said braking cables, said second power means working in conjunction with said first power means when said articulated fingers are operating in said first mode by tracking said first power means so that said braking cables are maintained without substantial slack or tension, said second power means serving to hold said braking cables fast to thereby anchor said base digits relative to said frame when it is desired to operate said articulated fingers in said second mode. 3. A compact, dual mode robotic mechanical hand for gripping and releasing objects, comprising; a frame, a fixed finger extending from said frame, a pair of articulated fingers joined to said frame and opposed to said fixed finger, each articulated finger including a base digit pivoted to said frame and a tip digit pivoted to said base digit, each of said articulated fingers being operable in a first mode by a gripping cable and an oppositely acting releasing cable, said gripping cables being adapted to move each of said articulated fingers into a gripping position so as to grip an object in cooperation with the other articulated finger against said fixed finger by initially pivoting said base digits relative to said frame until said base digits engage said object and then pivoting said tip digits pivot relative to said base digits until said tip digits engage said object, said releasing cables being adapted to move each of said articulated fingers into a release position by pivoting said tip and base digits oppositely to said gripping cables, tensioning means acting between said frame and said releasing cables to continually retract said releasing cables so as to move said articulated fingers into said release position, a first controllable power means mounted to said frame to operate said gripping cables by retracting said gripping cables to move said articulated fingers in opposition to said tensioning means into said gripping position and by playing out said gripping cables so that said tensioning means may retract said releasing cable and move said articulated fingers into said release position, a braking cable adapted to anchor both of said base digits relative to said frame so that said articulated fingers are operable in a second mode where said tip digits alone will pivot relative to said anchored base digits as said gripping cables are operated, and, a second controllable power means mounted to said frame to operate said braking cable, said second power means working in conjunction with said first power means when said articulated fingers are operating in said first mode by tracking said first power means so that said braking cable is maintained without substantial slack or tension, said second power means serving to hold said braking cable fast to thereby anchor both of said base digits relative to said frame when it is desired to operate said articulated fingers in said second mode.
