A pallet is releasably attached to a car which is stopped automatically at a work station in a coarse alignment with a robotic system at the work station. A movable plate, which tends to be distorted from a given shape, is releasably secured to the car and lifted from the car at the work station, aligned in the desired fine alignment during the lifting and then clamped in place relative to a reference plane in the fine alignment relative to the robotic system to remove the distortion. The plate is later dropped by gravity onto the car in a given alignment therewith for transfer to the next work station which repeats the fine alignment and distortion removal action.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for transferring a body to a work station, said body including means adapted to carry a workpiece, said system for orienting and clamping the transferred body to a support at the work station, said system comprising: a support having a plurality of stationary spaced reference surface defining a reference plane at said work station; transfer means movably coupled to the support for displacement into the work station in a coarse alignment with said surfaces at the work station; said transfer means including a body movably secured thereto, said body having a plurality of spaced reference surfaces, each corresponding to a different one of said support reference surfaces; said body and transfer means including alignment and securing means for movably securing said body to said transfer means in a given alignment therewith so that the body can displace a limited distance relative to the transfer means while remaining secured to the transfer means; actuating means secured to the support at the work station including means responsive to said coarse alignment of said transfer means with said support reference surfaces for displacing said body from said transfer means within said limited distance and for locking said body reference surfaces in engagement with said support reference surfaces at said reference plane; and body aligning means secured to said actuating means and to said body for automatically aligning said movably secured body in a fine reference alignment relative to said coarse alignment in response to and during said displacing of said body prior to said locking. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein said aligning means includes first and second sets of spaced mating male and female locating means, each set comprising one element secured to the actuating means and a second mating element secured to said body. 3. The system of claim 1 wherein said actuating means includes a plurality of spaced operating elements, each element corresponding to and aligned with a separate, different body reference surface for clamping that body reference surface against its corresponding support reference surface. 4. The system of claim 3 wherein said actuating elements each include a ram rod for lifting said body from said transfer means, said aligning means including a first set of mating alignment elements comprising a hemispherical surface on one of said body and ram rods and a mating conical opening in the other of said body and ram rods and a second set of mating alignment elements comprising a second hemispherical surface on one of said body and ram rods spaced from the first set and a tapered linear slot in the other of said body and ram rods, each set of elements being aligned with a different body reference surface when said body is in said coarse alignment. 5. The system of claim 1 further including a pair of hemispheres on said transfer means, said body having a pair of openings each adapted to closely receive a corresponding hemisphere, said openings each including a diverging edge portion facing said corresponding hemisphere. 6. The system of claim 1 wherein said support and body each include four spaced reference surfaces, said body aligning means including first and second hemispheres secured to the body in spaced relation and aligned with corresponding first and second body reference surfaces and first and second spaced openings in said actuating means, said openings being aligned so as to define a corresponding body reference point and alignment and are adapted to be aligned with a different hemisphere when said transfer means is aligned with said support surfaces, said actuating means engaging said openings with the respective hemispheres during said displacing for clamping said hemispheres to and in said openings. 7. A transfer system for transferring and locating a body at a work station, said system comprising: a body having a set of first spaced reference surfaces; a support fixedly secured at said work station, said support having a second set of spaced reference surfaces lying in at least one support reference plane, each second surface having a corresponding first surface, each second surface being adapted to mate with and locate a corresponding different one of said first set of reference surfaces at said at least one support reference plane when said body is aligned with said reference surfaces; actuating means secured to said support for displacing said aligned body and for forcing said first set of reference surfaces during said displacing into locked engagement with the corresponding ones of said second set of reference surfaces at said at least one reference plane, said actuating means and said body including a first set of mating locating means adjacent one of said body reference surfaces and a second set of mating locating means adjacent a second of said body reference surfaces, said locating means being adapted to engage and locate said body to a support reference alignment prior to said locked engagement; and body transfer means including body securing means for movably securing the body thereto so that the body can displace a limited distance relative to the transfer means while remaining secured to the transfer means, said transfer means including means for moving the body into the work station and for aligning said body with said actuating means, said support including means responsive to said body alignment at said work station for operating said actuating means to thereby align and locate said body at said support reference plane and alignment. 8. The system of claim 7 further including a plurality of work stations, each work station comprising a separate one of said support and actuating means, said transfer means including means for transferring said body to each said work station.
