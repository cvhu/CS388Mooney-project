Grinding and dressing wheel support and release apparatus adapted to maintain a high degree of accuracy and adapted for quick change of a grinding wheel and dressing roll. A grinding wheel unit is maintained between two axially aligned shafts for rotation therewith. One shaft is axially movable to permit ease of replacement of the grinding wheel unit. Mechanism is provided for sensing the axial position of the axially movable shaft and for control of the axial position of the axially movable shaft. A dressing roll structure has a dressing roll engageable with the grinding wheel. The dressing roll structure preferably has the same type of shaft support as the grinding wheel structure. Mechanism is provided for automatic removal and replacement of the grinding wheel and/or dressing roll. Mechanism is provided for automatically maintaining the dressing roll in engagement with the grinding wheel for continuous dressing of the grinding wheel.
