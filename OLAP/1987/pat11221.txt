An interface receives a high and low voltage signal from a single contact or pin of an output port of a multipurpose microcomputer and uses such signal to control the electrically-powered movement or action of a robot as determined by the programming of the microcomputer. The robot has a sensor connected to the interface and detecting whether or not a preselected condition exists at the robot. The interface sends a high and low voltage input signal to a second single contact or pin of the microcomputer port to communicate the condition of the robot sensed by the sensor. The robot is designed and constructed by the user from interchangeable parts, and the user writes essentially all of the computer programming in a simplified language. By a series of experiments, the student learns computer terminology and programming and robotic technology.
