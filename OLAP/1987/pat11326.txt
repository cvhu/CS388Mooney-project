Method and apparatus are disclosed for determining the position and attitude of objects, together with robotic systems employing same, and methods of targeting objects for such purposes. Particularly of interest is the application to continuous conveyors, particularly in the process of automobile manufacture.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of assembling doors or other panels into openings in objects comprising the steps of: providing a robot with electro-optical sensors on the tooling used to grasp said panel, with said sensors, sensing the location of said object and said opening in said object, positioning said panel in said opening with said robot using said sensors to feed back data to the control system of said robot, from said data, adjusting said position in said opening to equalize the gap between said panel and said opening so as to align said panel with said opening. 2. A method according to claim 1 wherein said sensors are further used to guide the robot to position said tooling in correct relationship to said panel before grasping said panel. 3. A method according to claim 1 further incorporating the step of electro-optically sensing targets on said object containing said opening to rough control the position of the robot to said object. 4. A method according to claim 1 including the further step of constraining at least one axis of said object motion to limit displacement or velocity. 5. A method according to claim 1 wherein said electro-optical sensor is a photodetector array camera.
