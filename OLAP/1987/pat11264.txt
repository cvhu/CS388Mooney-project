A plurality of spring clips (30), each having an elongated central member 2) with first (40) and second (38) ends and a plurality of resilient arms (36) radially extending therefrom, are simultaneously transferred between a transfer plate (90) and a pallet (20). The first ends (40) of the member (32) are lockably engaged in the transfer plate (90) with the second ends (38) thereof positioned into apertures (24) in the pallet (20). The central member (32) is rotated to release the first ends (40) from the transfer plate (90) while simultaneously lockably engaging the second ends (38) to the pallet (20) to secure the clips (30) therein and to capture a chip carrier (10) between the ends of each arm (36) and the pallet (20).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of transferring an article, having an elongated central member with first and second ends and a plurality of resilient arms extending radially therefrom, comprising the steps of: (a) positioning a first planar body, having the first end of the central member lockably engaged therewith, proximate a second planar body having an opening therein; (b) imparting relative movement to the first and second planar bodies to position the second end of the central member in the opening: (c) rotating the elongated central member to unlock the first end of said member from the first planar body while simultaneously lockably engaging the second end thereof to the second planar body; and (d) imparting relative movement to the first and second planar bodies to withdraw the first end of the elongated central member from the first planar body. 2. A method of transferring an article, having an elongated central member with first and second ends and a plurality of resilient arms extending radially therefrom, between first and second planar bodies, each having a passageway therethrough, comprising the steps of: (a) positioning the first planar body proximate to the second planar body so that the central member, whose first end is lockably engaged with a passageway in one of said bodies, has the second end in registration with and positioned within a corresponding passageway in the other of said bodies; (b) positioning a ratchet with a rotatable first end so that the first end of the ratchet engages one end of the central member; (c) rotating the first end of the ratchet so that simultaneously the central member is rotated, the first end of the central member disengages the passageway in one body and the second end of the central member lockably engages the passageway in the other body; and (d) moving the first planar body away from the second planar body so that the first end of the central member slidably releases from the first end of the ratchet and the passageway previously engaged therewith.
