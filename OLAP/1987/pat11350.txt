Successively laser cutting configurated openings in the walls of tubular manifold members with a plurality of robots and cooperative fixtures circumferentially around a cutting laser focus, the robots sequentially gripping the tubular members secured in exact orientation and position in the respective fixtures, by circumferentially expansible gripping jaws inside the tubular members, and advancing the members to and through a 360 degree pattern about the laser focus. The manifold laterals are subsequently welded to the member around the laser cut openings.
Claims The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows. 1. Apparatus for laser cutting a configurated opening in the wall of a tubular manifold member having an open end, comprising: at least one fixture having exterior body clamping means for clamping the exterior of a tubular manifold member in a predetermined position and predetermined orientation in said fixture; at least one multi-dimensionally-active robot spaced from said fixture; elongated circumferentially expansible tube gripping means on said robot for expanding within the tubular member to grip it; said robot being movable in a manner to cause axial alignment of said elongated tube gripping means with the open end of a tubular member clamped in said fixture, and movable axially toward said fixture to insert said expansible tube gripping means into the tubular member through the open end thereof, for expansion thereof to grip the inside wall of the tubular member; a laser beam source for directing a cutting laser beam toward a focal point; said robot being movable toward said focal point to transfer the tubular member to said focal point; and said robot being movable to advance through a programmed 360 degree pattern around said focal point in a manner to cause a configurated opening to be laser cut into the wall of the tubular manifold member. 2. The apparatus in claim 1 wherein: said fixture includes a configurated bed, and said clamping means is movable toward said bed to fixedly clamp the tubular manifold body thereon. 3. The apparatus in claim 1 wherein: said elongated tube gripping means comprises a plurality of engagement elements arranged in a 360 degree pattern, each having a wall engaging portion on the radial outer portion thereof, and means for spreading said elements whereby said elements can collectively grip the inner wall of the manifold body. 4. Apparatus for successively laser cutting configurated openings in the walls of tubular manifold members, each having an open end, comprising: a plurality of fixtures each having exterior body clamping means for clamping the exterior of a tubular manifold member in a predetermined position and predetermined orientation in said fixture; a like plurality of multi-dimensionally-active robots spaced from respective ones of said fixtures to be cooperative therewith; elongated circumferentially expansible tube gripping means on each said robot for expanding within a tubular member in a respective fixture to grip the tubular member; a laser beam source, and laser beam orienting means for orienting a cutting laser beam toward a focal point; said robots being arranged circumferentially around said focal point, and programmable to cooperate sequentially with said laser focal point; each said robot being movable in a manner to cause axial alignment of its said elongated tube gripping means with the open end of a tubular member clamped in the respective said fixture, and movable axially toward said fixture to insert said expansible tube gripping means into the tubular member through the open end thereof, for expansion thereof to grip the inside wall of the tubular member; each robot, after expansion of said gripping means, being movable toward said focal point to transfer the tubular member to said focal point; and each said robot being movable to advance through a programmed 360 degree pattern around said focal point in a manner to cause a configurated opening to be laser cut into the wall of the tubular manifold member. 5. The apparatus in claim 4 wherein: each said fixture includes a configurated bed, and its said clamping means is movable toward said bed to fixedly clamp the tubular manifold body thereon. 6. The apparatus in claim 4 wherein: each said elongated tube gripping means comprises a plurality of engagement elements arranged in a 360 degree pattern, each having a wall engaging portion on the radial outer portion thereof; and tapered means for spreading said elements whereby said elements can collectively grip the inner wall of the manifold body. 7. A method of laser cutting configurated openings into the side wall of a tubular manifold member, comprising the steps of: providing a configurated tubular stainless steel manifold member having an open end; inserting into said open end an expansible robotic gripper, and expanding the gripper in a manner to grip the inner walls of the tubular member for maneuvered positioning of the member; directing a laser beam toward a focal point; and moving the clamp and tubular member in a programmed pattern of 360 degrees about said focal point to cut a configurated opening into the wall of the member. 8. A method of forming an exhaust manifold comprising the steps of: providing a configurated tubular stainless steel manifold member having an end opening; inserting an expansible gripper through said end opening into said member; expanding said gripper to grip said tubular member; directing a cutting laser beam toward the side wall of said member while advancing said member relative to said laser beam in a 360 degree pattern in a manner to cut a configurated opening through said side wall; and welding to said member around said opening one end of a lateral tube.
