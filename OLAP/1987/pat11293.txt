A plurality of spring clips (30), each having an elongated central member (32) with first (40) and second (38) ends and a plurality of resilient arms (36) radially extending therefrom, are simultaneously transferred between a transfer plate (90) and a pallet (20). The first ends (40) of the member (32) are lockably engaged in the transfer plate (90) with the second ends (38) thereof positioned into apertures (24) in the pallet (20). The central member (32) is rotated to release the first ends (40) from the transfer plate (90) while simultaneously lockably engaging the second ends (38) to the pallet (20) to secure the clips (30) therein and to capture a chip carrier (10) between the ends of each arm (36) and the pallet (20).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for transferring an article, having an elongated central member with first and second ends and a plurality of resilient arms extending radially therefrom, between first and second planar bodies, said apparatus comprising: (a) the first planar body having a receiving passage therethrough which is adapted to lockably engage the first end of the central member when inserted therein; (b) a first plate; (c) a wrench having first and second ends, the first end being rotatably mounted in the first plate and adapted to lockably engage the first end of the central member when the first planar body is positioned for engagement; a pivitable arm; a slide, connected to the arm, slidably connected to the first plate for linear movement thereon, and which has the second end of the wrench pivotally connected thereto so that when the arm is moved and the slide moves, the first end of the wrench is rotated by the pivoting movement of the second end and the central member releases from the first planar body and lockably engages the second planar body during insertion and releases from the second planar body and lockably engages the first planar body during removal; and (d) a plurality of vertical posts spaced so as to be located proximate the sides of the second planar body placed therebetween, the first plate adapted to carry the first planar body and slidably mounted to the posts for movement therealong to and from the second planar body, and means for moving the first plate along the posts. 2. The apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein the first planar body is a transfer plate adapted to be removable from said apparatus and which further comprises a plurality of depending protrusions, each spaced so as to keep arms of the article from rotating during transfer of the article, and the second planar body is a pallet. 3. The apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein the first plate further comprises a comb having a channel sized and shaped to slidably pass therethrough one end of the central member of the article engaged to the first planar body as the first planar body is secured to the first plate for carriage so as to align the end in a predetermined orientation.
