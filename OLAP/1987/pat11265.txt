Apparatus constructed such that it may control various other equipment for the performance of various work tasks, even other equipment yet to be designed for work tasks yet to be designed. The improvement in the apparatus feature a call-back control procedure which is activatable from device intelligence to ensure that a specific robotic device can be "called-back", i.e. reactivated, to perform some specific action without the necessity of there being a code entry in the sequence intelligence of the central computer system enabling the specific action. The apparatus comprises a central computer control means comprising (1) a dictionary storage means for tagging and storing command-specific parameters for a specific work tasks and that specific robot module to which each of the parameters belongs and (2) sequencing means to schedule said work-tasks for a plurality of said modules. The module also can be activated for the task without use of the sequencing means, e.g. by having the module request one of its own dictionary entries.
