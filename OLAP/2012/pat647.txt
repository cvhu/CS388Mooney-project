This invention provides methods of inhibiting replication of a poxvirus by contacting a poxvirus with a compound having formula XVII which in turn reduce, inhibit, or abrogate poxvirus DNA polymerase activity and/or its interaction with its processivity factor. Formula XVII can be utilized to treat humans and animals suffering from a poxvirus infection. Pharmaceutical compositions for treating poxvirus infected subjects are also provided.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inhibiting, treating, or abrogating a poxvirus infection in a subject comprising the step of administering to said subject a compound having the formula XVII: ##STR00099## whereby said compound reduces, inhibits, or abrogates activity of a DNA polymerase of said poxvirus, thereby inhibiting, treating, or abrogating a poxvirus infection in the subject. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said step of inhibiting replication of a poxvirus comprises inhibiting DNA synthesis. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said poxvirus is a vaccinia virus or a variola virus. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said DNA polymerase is an E9 DNA polymerase or a homologue thereof from a different species. 5. The method of claim 1, whereby said compound reduces, inhibits, or abrogates interaction of said DNA polymerase with a processivity factor, thereby affecting activity of said DNA polymerase. 6. The method of claim 5, wherein said processivity factor is an A20 or D4R processivity factor or a homologue thereof from a different species.
