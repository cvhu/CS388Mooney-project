A brain-based device (BBD) having a physical mobile device NOMAD controlling and under control by a simulated nervous system. The simulated nervous system is based on an intricate anatomy and physiology of the hippocampus and its surrounding neuronal regions including the cortex. The BBD integrates spatial signals from numerous objects in time and provides flexible navigation solutions to aid in the exploration of unknown environments. As NOMAD navigates in its real world environment, the hippocampus of the simulated nervous system organizes multi-modal input information received from sensors on NOMAD over timescales and uses this organization for the development of spatial and episodic memories necessary for navigation.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mobile brain-based device for navigating in a real-world environment, comprising: a) a mobile adaptive device having sensors for sensing multi-modal information in the real-world environment; b) a simulated nervous system for receiving and processing the multi-modal information sensed by the sensors and, in response, for outputting information to control movement of said mobile adaptive device in the environment; and c) wherein said simulated nervous system exhibits the morphology and functionality of a part of a human brain, and includes sensor input streams, an output motor stream, and a neural area analogous to the hippocampus of the human brain being coupled to said sensor input streams and to said output motor stream of the simulated nervous system. 2. A mobile brain-based device according to claim 1, wherein said sensor input streams include a neuronal area analogous to the cortex of the human brain.
