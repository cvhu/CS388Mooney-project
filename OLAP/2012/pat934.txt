In a robotic tool coupler, a rotating cam member having a plurality of surfaces formed therein urges a plurality of ball members in one tool coupling unit radially to contact an angled surface in the other tool coupling unit. Further rotation of the cam member exerts a radial force through the ball members onto the angled surface. A component of that force is directed by the angled surface toward the opposite tool coupling unit, locking the two units together. The cam member may include a failsafe surface and/or a failsafe lobe to maintain the two units locked together in the event of a loss of power to positively actuate the cam member.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A robotic tool changer, comprising: a first unit operative to be attached to one of a robot and a robotic tool; a second unit operative to be attached to the other of the robot and a robotic tool, and further operative to be selectively coupled to and decoupled from the first unit; a plurality of ball members disposed circumferentially about an axis in the first unit; an angled surface in the second unit; and a cam member disposed in one of the units inwardly of the ball members and rotatable between decoupled and coupled positions, the cam member comprising a plurality of teeth, each tooth associated with a ball member and comprising a plurality of surfaces, wherein the cam member is operative to engage the ball members in the first unit and to urge the ball members radially outwardly from the axis and against the angled surface to lock the first and second units together when the cam member is rotated to the coupled position, wherein the plurality of surfaces includes a nesting surface operative to contact a ball member in a fully retracted position wherein the ball member does not contact the second unit, an actuating surface operative to displace a ball member towards contact with the angled surface of the second unit as the cam member rotates toward the coupled position, a locking surface operative to press a ball member against the angled surface of the second unit, locking the first and second units together, when the cam member is rotated to the coupled position, and a failsafe surface interposed between the locking surface and the actuating surface, the failsafe surface contacting a ball member at a normal angle to the direction of motion of the ball member as the cam member is rotated between decoupled and coupled positions. 2. The tool changer of claim 1 wherein the plurality of surfaces includes a failsafe lobe interposed between the locking surface and the actuating surface, the failsafe lobe forming a ball member retention channel with the locking surface operative to retain the ball member between the locking surface and the failsafe lobe in the absence of rotational force applied to the cam member. 3. The tool changer of claim 1 wherein the cam member and the ball members are disposed in the first unit. 4. The tool changer of claim 3 wherein the ball members are disposed in a plurality of holes in a collar of the first unit that is disposed within an annular chamber in the second unit when the units are to be coupled together, and wherein rotating the cam member from the uncoupled to the coupled position moves the ball members from retracted positions within the holes to extended positions wherein the ball members are disposed partially outward of the collar and in contact with the angled surface of the second unit. 5. The tool changer of claim 4 wherein the holes in the collar of the first unit have a diameter at the interior of the collar greater than the diameter of the ball members, and a diameter at the exterior of the collar less than the diameter of the ball members, thereby retaining the ball members in the holes when the first and second unit are decoupled. 6. A robotic tool changer, comprising: a first unit operative to be attached to one of a robot and a robotic tool; a second unit operative to be attached to the other of the robot and a robotic tool, and further operative to be selectively coupled to and decoupled from the first unit; a plurality of ball members disposed circumferentially about an axis in the first unit; an angled surface in the second unit; and a cam member disposed in one of the units inwardly of the ball members and rotatable between decoupled and coupled positions, wherein the cam member is operative to engage the ball members in the first unit and to urge the ball members radially outwardly from the axis and against the angled surface to lock the first and second units together when the cam member is rotated to the coupled position; and wherein the unit housing the cam member further comprises an electric motor operative to selectively rotationally drive the cam member between decoupled and coupled positions. 7. The tool changer of claim 6 wherein the unit housing the cam member further comprises a drive train including a worm gear between the motor and the cam member. 8. A tool changer, comprising: a tool unit operative to attach to a robotic tool and including a generally circular chamber; a master unit operative to attach to a robot, and to selectively couple to and decouple from the tool unit; an annular collar on the master unit, having a plurality of holes formed therethrough; a plurality of ball members disposed within the holes; a rotating cam member disposed within the annular collar in the master unit, the cam member operative to urge the ball members radially outward of the collar as the cam member rotates from an uncoupled to a coupled position; and an angled surface in the tool unit chamber opposite each collar hole when the master and tool units are abutted, the angled surface operative to direct a component of the force applied to it by the ball members towards the master unit; wherein the rotating cam member comprises a plurality of teeth, each tooth including a nesting surface operative to contact a ball in a fully retracted position wherein the ball does not extend outward of the annular collar; an actuating surface operative to displace a ball towards contact with the angled surface of the tool unit as the cam member rotates; a locking surface operative to press a ball against the angled surface of the second unit when the cam member rotates to the coupled position; and a failsafe surface interposed between the locking surface and the actuating surface, the failsafe surface contacting a ball at a normal angle to the direction of motion of the ball as the cam member rotates between the uncoupled and coupled positions. 9. The tool changer of claim 8 wherein each cam member tooth further includes a failsafe lobe interposed between the locking surface and the actuating surface, the failsafe lobe forming a ball retention channel with the locking surface operative to retain the ball between the locking surface and the failsafe lobe in the absence of rotational force applied to the cam member. 10. A method of selectively coupling two robotic tool coupler units, comprising: abutting the two units; rotating a cam member in one unit from an uncoupled to a coupled position; urging a plurality of ball members disposed in one unit radially outwardly from a central axis toward an angled surface in the other unit by the rotating cam member; after the ball members contact the angled surface as the cam member is rotated to the coupled position, applying a force directed radially outwardly from the central axis by the rotating cam member through the ball members to the angled surface, a component of the force on the angled surface directed toward the other tool coupler unit and operative to lock the two units together; and in the event of loss of power to rotate the cam member, maintaining the rotary position of the cam member by eliminating any component of force exerted by the ball members on the cam member in a direction of rotation toward the uncoupled position. 11. The method of claim 10 further comprising presenting a resistance to turning the cam member in a direction of rotation toward the uncoupled position, such that in the event of loss of power to rotate the cam member, the two units remain coupled together.
