Techniques for managing data in a distributed system include receiving first mobile data that includes non-routing data for a mobile node of multiple nodes in a distributed data system. The mobile node is associated with a first data item of multiple data items in the distributed data system. Non-routing data includes organizational data for data items in the distributed database or spatial data, or both. Spatial data includes at least one of a physical location, shape, size, and orientation. A non-topological relationship is determined between the first data item and a different second data item based on the non-routing data. Content is communicated with the mobile node based at least in part on the non-topological relationship. These techniques allow conservation of valuable network resources by communicating only data relevant to a recipient based on the spatial or organizational context of the communicating nodes.
