A rotor attachment apparatus for attaching a rotor of a motor coaxially to a crankshaft by inserting the rotor into a rotor housing that is attached to an engine, including: a rotor support member; rotor positioning members that engage some of a plurality of bolt insertion holes provided in the rotor, to thereby position the rotor; a temporary fixation bolt that temporarily fixes the rotor on the rotor support member; a drive shaft a tip portion of which is engaged with a shaft end portion of the crankshaft, and which supports the rotor support member movably in an axis direction via a screw mechanism; a base member that moves the rotor support member toward and away from the rotor while rotatably supporting a base end of the drive shaft; base positioning members that engage the rotor housing; and a fastening mechanism which engages a head of a coupling bolt inserted into at least one of the bolt insertion holes, and which is supported by the rotor support member so as to bias the coupling bolt toward the rotor.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A rotor attachment apparatus for coupling a rotor of a motor to a crankshaft of an engine by inserting the rotor into a rotor housing that is attached to the engine when the motor is to be attached coaxially with the crankshaft, the rotor attachment apparatus comprising: a rotor support member that faces a lateral face of the rotor in an axis direction of the rotor; rotor positioning members that are protrudingly provided on the rotor support member and engage some of a plurality of bolt insertion holes provided in the rotor for coupling to the crankshaft; a temporary fixation bolt that temporarily fixes the rotor on the rotor support member in a state where the rotor is positioned with respect to the rotor support member by the rotor positioning members; a drive shaft which is arranged coaxially with the rotor, a tip portion of which is engaged with a shaft end portion of the crankshaft, and which supports the rotor support member movably in the axis direction via a screw mechanism; a base member that is arranged on a side of the rotor support member opposite to the rotor and moves the rotor support member toward and away from the rotor while rotatably supporting a base end of the drive shaft; base positioning members that are protrudingly provided on the rotor housing side of the base member and engage the rotor housing; and a fastening mechanism which engages a head of a coupling bolt inserted into at least one of the bolt insertion holes other than the ones to be engaged with the rotor positioning members, to thereby impart a torque to the head of the coupling bolt, and which is supported by the rotor support member so as to bias the coupling bolt toward the rotor. 2. A method for coupling a rotor of a motor to a crankshaft of an engine comprising: providing a rotor attachment apparatus operatively associated with the method and comprising: a rotor support member that faces a lateral face of a rotor of a motor in an axis direction of the rotor; rotor positioning members that are protrudingly provided on the rotor support member and engage some of a plurality of bolt insertion holes provided in the rotor for coupling to a crankshaft of an engine; a temporary fixation bolt that temporarily fixes the rotor on the rotor support member in a state where the rotor is positioned with respect to the rotor support member by the rotor positioning members; a drive shaft which is arranged coaxially with the rotor, a tip portion of which is engaged with a shaft end portion of the crankshaft, and which supports the rotor support member movably in the axis direction via a screw mechanism; a base member that is arranged on a side of the rotor support member opposite to the rotor and moves the rotor support member toward and away from the rotor while rotatably supporting a base end of the drive shaft; base positioning members that are protrudingly provided on the base member and engage the rotor housing that is attached to the engine; and a fastening mechanism which engages a head of a coupling bolt inserted into at least one of the bolt insertion holes other than the ones to be engaged with the rotor positioning members, to thereby impart a torque to the head of the coupling bolt, and which is supported by a rotor support member so as to bias the coupling bolt toward a rotor; the method further comprising: a first step of positioning the rotor with respect to the rotor support member by the rotor positioning members before the rotor is inserted into the rotor housing; a second step of temporarily fixing the rotor support member and the rotor on each other by the temporary fixation bolt after the first step; a third step of positioning the base member with respect to the rotor housing by the base positioning members; a fourth step of engaging a tip portion of the drive shaft with a shaft end portion of the crankshaft after the second and third steps; a fifth step of moving the rotor support member and the rotor toward the rotor housing by the drive shaft after the fourth step, to thereby insert the rotor into the rotor housing; a sixth step of releasing the temporary fixation by the temporary fixation bolt and spacing the rotor away from the rotor support member by a biasing force of the fastening mechanism before the rotor is completely inserted into the rotor housing, to thereby making the rotor movable within a range of a clearance between the rotor positioning members and the bolt insertion holes; a seventh step of performing a positioning between the rotor and the crankshaft by engaging the rotor with the shaft end portion of the crankshaft after the sixth step; an eighth step of tightening a coupling bolt by the fastening mechanism after the seventh step, to thereby partly couple the rotor to the crankshaft; and a ninth step of inserting coupling bolts into the other bolt insertion holes and tightening after the eighth step, to thereby completely couple the rotor to the crankshaft.
