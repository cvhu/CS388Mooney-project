A positive displacement pump (1) is equipped with a pump cylinder (2), a pump piston (7), a cylinder space (9), a pressure sensor (10), and a pressure channel (12). A main portion (13) of the pressure channel (12) extends parallel to a longitudinal axis (3) of the pump cylinder (2), for providing fluidic connection between the cylinder space (9) and the pressure sensor (10). In the improved alternative positive displacement pump (1), the main portion (13) of the pressure channel (12) is located inside of the pump cylinder (2) or pump piston (7) and extends, at least in a foremost position of the pump piston (7), from a cylinder bottom (5) beyond or to an opening (11,11') in the cylinder wall (4) or pump piston (7).
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A positive displacement pump (1) comprising: a pump cylinder (2) with a longitudinal axis (3), a cylinder wall (4) extending parallel to the longitudinal axis (3), a cylinder bottom (5) extending essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (3), and a cylinder outlet (6) that is located in or close to the cylinder bottom (5); a pump piston (7) with a piston front (8) that is reciprocally movable inside the pump cylinder (2) in direction of the longitudinal axis (3); a cylinder space (9) that is located inside the pump cylinder (2) and that is defined by the cylinder wall (4), the cylinder bottom (5), and the piston front (8); a pressure sensor (10) for detecting the pressure in the cylinder space (9), the pressure sensor being located in or outside a rear opening (26) which is located at an end (34) of the pump cylinder (2) that is opposite to the cylinder bottom (5); and a pressure channel (12) for providing fluidic connection between the cylinder space (9) and the pressure sensor (10), wherein the cylinder wall (4) comprises a piston sleeve (14), the piston sleeve (14) being located on the inner side of the cylinder wall (4) and extending over essentially the entire length of the cylinder wall (4) to the cylinder bottom (5), and wherein the pressure channel (12) comprises a main portion (13), which is accomplished as at least one slot (15) in the piston sleeve (14), said main portion (13) extending parallel to the longitudinal axis (3) of the pump cylinder (2) from the cylinder bottom (5) to or beyond the rear opening (26) at an end (34) of the pump cylinder (2) over substantially the entire length of the piston sleeve (14). 2. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 1, wherein the pump piston 7 comprises at least one guide bushing 52 that is applied around and that travels with the pump piston 7. 3. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 1, wherein the pressure sensor (10) is located outside the opening (26) of the cylinder wall (4), a transverse channel (31) fluidly connecting the pressure sensor (10) with the pressure channel (12). 4. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 1, wherein a sealing member (24) is located between the pump piston (7) and the cylinder wall (4) or the piston sleeve (14). 5. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 4, wherein the sealing member (24) is accomplished as a stationary seal that is captured in a recess (32) of the cylinder wall (4), of the piston sleeve (14), or of a cylindrical part (33) located at a rear end (34) of the pump cylinder (2). 6. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 4, wherein the sealing member (24) is accomplished as a moving seal that is captured in a recess (32') of the pump piston (7). 7. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 1, comprising a motor drive (35) for reciprocally driving the pump piston (7) in direction of the longitudinal axis (3). 8. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 1, comprising a reception cone (36) for receiving a disposable pipette or dispenser tip (37). 9. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 8, further comprising an ejection tube (38) for ejecting a disposable pipette or dispenser tip (37) from the reception cone (36). 10. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 9, wherein the ejection tube (38) comprises a flange (39) for abutment with an ejection actuator (40). 11. The positive displacement pump (1) of claim 10, wherein the ejection actuator (40) is accomplished to be actuated by the motor drive (35) for reciprocally driving the pump piston (7) in direction of the longitudinal axis (3) via a movement transmitter (41) to eject the disposable pipette or dispenser tip (37) from the reception cone (36) simultaneously with a very last increment of a dispensed sample volume.
