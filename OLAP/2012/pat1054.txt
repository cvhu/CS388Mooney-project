The system as claimed in claim 7 further comprising: a printer adjacent to the programmer for printing the label; an assembly line adjacent to the feeder; an assembly line programmer adjacent the assembly line, and a controller connected to coordinate interactions among the printer, the assembly line, the assembly line programmer, and the programmer. 12. The system as claimed in claim 7 wherein the feeder is for feeding the labels to the assembly line just-in-time. 13. A radio frequency identification system comprising: a feeder for feeding a radio frequency identification transponder along a first direction to a pickup point for an X, Y, and Z movement pick and place mechanism for placing on a product being assembled on an assembly line and moving along a second direction perpendicular to the first direction; a programmer adjacent the feeder for writing transponder content to the radio frequency identification transponder; a sensor adjacent to the feeder for sensing the radio frequency identification transponder at the pickup point; a control system connectible to the assembly line and connected to the feeder and the programmer for causing the feeder to feed another radio frequency identification transponder to the pickup point when the sensor senses the absence of the radio frequency identification transponder at the pickup point, the control system connectible to the assembly line to have the X, Y, and Z movement pick and place mechanism of the assembly line pick up the radio frequency identification transponder at the pickup point and place it on the product. 14. The system as claimed in claim 13 further comprising a sensor connected to the control system for sensing the absence or presence of the radio frequency identification transponder in the feeder. 15. The system as claimed in claim 13 wherein the programmer includes circuitry for reading transponder content from the radio frequency identification transponder. 16. The system as claimed in claim 13 further comprising an assembly line radio frequency identification transponder reader adjacent the assembly line and connected to the control system for providing transponder information to the control system. 17. The system as claimed in claim 13 further comprising a printer connected to the control system for printing a label corresponding to the transponder content read from the radio frequency identification transponder. 18. The system as claimed in claim 13 wherein the programmer includes process control circuitry for compatibility with different assembly lines, communication circuitry for accepting input from different communication systems, or feeder circuitry for controlling different feeders. 19. A method of operation of radio frequency identification system comprising: feeding a radio frequency identification transponder along a first direction to a pickup point for an X, Y, and Z movement pick and placement mechanism in a feeder for placing on a product being assembled on an assembly line and moving along a second direction perpendicular to the first direction; writing transponder content to the radio frequency identification transponder by a programmer; sensing the radio frequency identification transponder at the pickup point with a sensor adjacent to the feeder; and causing the feeder to feed another radio frequency identification transponder to the pickup point when the sensor sense the absence of the radio frequency identification transponder at the pickup point with a control system connected to the sensor and the feeder, the control system connectible to the assembly line to have the X, Y, and Z movement pick and place mechanism of the assembly line pick up the radio frequency identification transponder at the pick up point and place it on the product. 20.
