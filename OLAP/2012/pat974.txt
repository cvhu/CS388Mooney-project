One exemplary embodiment of the invention includes grafting a thermoplastic hot melt adhesive material to a shape memory polymer surface.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method comprising: providing a shape memory polymer layer and grafting an adhesive polymer to the shape memory polymer layer; and grafting an intermediate material to the shape memory polymer layer prior to grafting the adhesive. 2. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the shape memory polymer layer comprises an epoxy polymer. 3. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the adhesive comprises poly(vinyl acetate) or its copolymers. 4. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the adhesive comprises poly(vinyl alcohol) or its copolymers. 5. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the adhesive comprises a phenoxy polymer. 6. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the adhesive comprises a thermoplastic epoxy polymer. 7. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the adhesive comprises poly(vinyl chloride) or its copolymers. 8. A method comprising: providing a shape memory polymer layer and grafting an adhesive polymer to the shape memory polymer layer; and grafting an intermediate material to the shape memory polymer layer prior to grafting the adhesive; wherein the intermediate comprises polyethylenimine. 9. A method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the shape memory polymer layer is a foam. 10. A method comprising: providing an epoxy shape memory polymer layer including unreacted epoxy groups on a surface thereof, grafting polyethylenimine including a plurality of amine groups onto the epoxy shape memory polymer layer surface via the reaction between the epoxy groups of the shape memory polymer layer and the amines of the polyethylenimine, and thereafter grafting poly (vinyl acetate) with carboxylic acid groups to the shape memory polymer layer by the reaction between amines of the polyethylenimine and the carboxylic acid groups of the poly(vinyl acetate).
