Claims What is claimed is: 1. A mobile robot system, comprising: a first robotic vehicle comprising a first end comprising a first pair of wheels, a second end comprising a second pair of wheels, and a first driven support surface surrounding the first and second pair of wheels to propel the first vehicle in the direction of the first and second ends of the first vehicle; a second robotic vehicle comprising a first end oriented toward the second end of the first vehicle and comprising a third pair of wheels, a second end oriented away from the first vehicle and comprising a fourth pair of wheels, and a second driven support surface surrounding the third and fourth pair of wheels to propel the second vehicle in the direction of the first and second ends of the second vehicle; and a connecting member rotatably connected to the second end of the first vehicle to be coaxial with the second pair of wheels and rotatably connected to the first end of the second vehicle to be coaxial with the third pair of wheels, the connecting member being rotatable about the axis of the second pair of wheels by the first vehicle and rotatable about the axis of the third pair of wheels by the second vehicle such that the connecting member and each pair of wheels can rotate freely relative to each other. 2. The mobile robot system of claim 1, wherein the first and second driven support surfaces are configured to drive the first and second vehicles to raise the second end of the first vehicle and the first end of the second vehicle while the connecting member maintains a separation between the second end of the first vehicle and the first end of the second vehicle. 3. The mobile robot system of claim 1, wherein when the second end of the first vehicle and the first end of the second vehicle are raised, the first and second driven supports propel the robot system to rotate within a sweep volume defined by the first and second driven support surfaces. 4. A method for operating a mobile robot system to surmount an obstacle, the mobile robot system comprising a first vehicle having a first end comprising a first pair of wheels, a second end comprising a second pair of wheels, and a first driven support surface surrounding the first and second pairs of wheels, a second vehicle having a first end oriented toward the second end of the first vehicle and comprising a third pair of wheels, a second end oriented away from the first vehicle and comprising a fourth pair of wheels, and a second driven support surface surrounding the third and fourth pairs of wheels, and a connecting member rotatably connected to the first vehicle coaxial with the second pair of wheels and to the second vehicle coaxial with the third pair of wheels such that the connecting member and each pair of wheels can rotate freely relative to each other, the method comprising: driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces to move the first vehicle and the second vehicle toward the obstacle until the first vehicle contacts the obstacle; driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces to propel the first vehicle to ascend the obstacle; rotating the connecting member in at least one of a first direction by the first vehicle and a second direction by the second vehicle while the first vehicle ascends the obstacle; driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces and rotating the connecting member by at least one of the second vehicle in a third direction opposite to the second direction and by the first vehicle in a fourth direction opposite to the first direction while the first vehicle surmounts the obstacle to raise the first end of the second vehicle by the connecting member; driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces when the first vehicle surmounts the obstacle until the connecting member contacts the obstacle at a point of contact; driving the second support surface while maintaining the orientation of the connecting member relative to the first and second vehicles to rotate the connecting member about the point of contact until the second support surface contacts the obstacle; rotating the connecting member by at least one of the first vehicle in the first direction and the second vehicle in the third direction until the first support surface engages the obstacle; driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces and rotating the connecting member by the first vehicle in the first direction until the second vehicle begins to surmount the obstacle; and driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces and rotating the connecting member by at least one of the first vehicle in a fourth direction opposite to the first direction and by the second vehicle in the second direction when the second vehicle surmounts the obstacle. 5. The method of claim 4, wherein driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces to move the first vehicle and the second vehicle toward the obstacle until first vehicle contacts obstacle comprises: rotating the connecting member by the first vehicle in the first direction to raise the first end of the first vehicle and driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces to move the first vehicle and the second vehicle toward the obstacle until first vehicle contacts obstacle. 6. The method of claim 4, wherein driving the second support surface while maintaining the orientation of the connecting member relative to the first and second vehicles to rotate the connecting member about the point of contact until second support surface contacts the obstacle comprises: driving the second support surface while maintaining the orientation of the connecting member relative to the first and second vehicles to rotate the connecting member about the point of contact until the first support surface disengages from the obstacle and the second support surface contacts the obstacle. 7. The method of claim 4, wherein rotating the connecting member by at least one of the first vehicle in the first direction and the second vehicle in the third direction until the first support surface engages the obstacle comprises: rotating the connecting member by at least one of the first vehicle in the first direction and the second vehicle in the third direction until the first support surface engages the obstacle and the second support surface disengages from the obstacle. 8. The method of claim 7, wherein driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces and rotating the connecting member by the first vehicle in the first direction until the second vehicle begins to surmount the obstacle comprises: driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces and rotating the connecting member by at least one of the first vehicle in the first direction and the second vehicle in the third direction until the second support surface engages the obstacle, and driving at least one of the first and second support surfaces until the second vehicle begins to surmount the obstacle.
