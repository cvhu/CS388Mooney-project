A method and apparatus for performing an order change in a corrugator uses a minimum slit head configuration with all slit heads carried on two sides of a single tool support structure. A single robot is operable on the support structure to independently reset the positions of slit heads during a running order to prepare for subsequent order change in a most efficient manner, utilizing order scheduling that eliminates order changes that cannot be formed with the minimum slit head configuration.
