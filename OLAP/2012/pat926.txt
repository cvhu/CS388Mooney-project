Magnetic handling structure (1a) comprising a retractable magnet (4) and a probe (3) for the manipulation of magnetic particles in biological samples and methods of handling magnetic particles in biological samples.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus comprising: a first process path for isolating a nucleic acid, the first process path including temperature assembly and a magnetic assembly; an array of first containers positioned on the first process path, the first containers configured to receive a sample to be processed on the first process path; wherein each of the temperature assembly and the magnetic assembly are configured to receive the array of first containers; a second process path for amplification of nucleic acids, wherein the second process path is positioned vertically below the first process path; and a second container positioned on the second process path, the second container configured to receive an isolated item of interest from a sample processed on the first process path. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the apparatus further comprises a horizontal surface upon which the first process path is mounted, wherein the horizontal surface includes an opening adapted for the transfer of the second container to the second process path. 3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the second process path is enclosed in a chamber containing a vent, and the apparatus includes a pressure source fluidly connected with the chamber for causing air to flow from the chamber through the vent.
