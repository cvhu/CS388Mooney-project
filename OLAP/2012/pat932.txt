A swiftlet breeding facility, for use in creating and harvesting edible bird's nests. The facility includes sub-systems for injecting live insect and worm prey, and water, into an aerial enclosure to provide a feeding system imitative of a natural swiftlet feeding environment.
Claims We claim: 1. A method of breeding swiftlets for their edible nests (62) comprising: housing swiftlets in an artificial cave system (100) having an enclosed aerial feeding chamber (259) and cage (350), the cage comprising a feed dispenser (300) and water dispenser (214), the feed dispenser and the water dispenser mounted on a ceiling of the cage; for providing an aerial supply of nutrients to feed and water the swiftlets; producing aerial feed in a breeding apparatus (263); (264); (265), the aerial feed comprising a swarm of live airborne insects (297) and worms (128); providing the aerial feed (297) to feed the swiftlets, the aerial feed dispensed by the feed dispenser; providing aerial water droplets to the swiftlets from the water dispenser by injecting water drawn by a pump (357) from a pond (260) into the enclosed aerial feeding chamber; and providing a pneumatic propulsion mechanism to propel the aerial feed through a pipe connected at a first end to the pneumatic propulsion mechanism and at a second end to the feed dispenser, the pneumatic propulsion mechanism comprising an air intake suction port at a first end and a discharge port connected to the pipe connected to the feed dispenser, the air intake suction port draws in the aerial feed from within a container and air flushed from the pneumatic propulsion mechanism propels the aerial feed through the pipe to the feed dispenser and introduces the aerial feed into the aerial feeding chamber. 2. The method of breeding swiftlets (61) for their edible nests (62) of claim 1 further comprising: providing a spray of aerial drinking water by means of a pressurized water system wherein water from a pond (260) is delivered by pump (357) up a pipe (351) and ejected through a discharge nozzle (214); from a top of cage structure (350); and injecting drinking water directly into a flight space (350a) of the swiftlets. 3. A method of breeding swiftlets for their edible nests (62) of claim 1 further comprising: cultivating said aerial feed materials in an enclosed breeding apparatus (263), (265). 4. A method of breeding swiftlets for their edible nests (62) of claim 1 further comprising: cultivating said aerial feed in an open air insects breeding apparatus (264). 5. A method of breeding swiftlets (61) for their edible nests (62) of claim 4 further comprising providing an A-shaped pyramidal structure having a stepped stair-case structure with a plurality of horizontal steps and a vertical gripping surface for the swiftlets to land vertically to feed. 6. A method of breeding swiftlets (61) for their edible nests (62) of claim 5 further comprising providing: a vertically inclined cradle apparatus (330) for breeding the swiftlets; manually feeding the swiftlets in artificial nest cups (202) with insect bolus (276) by farmers (378); providing a device to assist swiflets that have fallen or failed in flight attempt; and providing an apparatus to hold feed materials (276), (297), (128); the apparatus having a gripping substrate for the swiftlets to cling to securely; to exercise their wings before fledging.
