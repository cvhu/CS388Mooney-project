A joint simulator for duplicating the biomechanical properties of body segments with joints. In one embodiment, the joint simulator includes a body model of the body segment to be simulated, controllable drive elements which are coupled mechanically with the body model in such a way that movements of the body model which correspond to real biomechanical joint movements of the body segment to be simulated can be effected by controlling the drive elements, a sensor arrangement for detecting forces and movements introduced by an examining person on the body model and a programmable control device for controlling the drive elements, whereby the control device is configured such that the measured signals processed by the sensor arrangement are introduced into a computer.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A programmable joint simulator with force and movement feedback for duplicating modifiable biomechanical properties of human and animal body segments with joints, whereby the joint simulator has the following features: a body model, which essentially has the shape and hardness properties of the body segment to be simulated, controllable drive elements, which are coupled mechanically with the body model, in such a way that movements of the body model, which correspond to real biomechanical joint movements of the body segment to be simulated, can be effected by controlling the drive elements, a sensor arrangement for detecting forces and movements, which are introduced by an examining person with his/her hands, and without a tool, on the body model, whereby the sensors of sensor arrangement are arranged in the kinematic chain between the body model and the drive elements and/or on the drive elements themselves and a programmable control device having a computer for controlling the drive elements in response to the manually introduced forces and movements of the examining person to provide haptic movement feedback of the body model to the examining person, whereby the control device is configured such that the measured signals processed by the sensor arrangement are introduced into the computer, in which a simulation program is stored, which, in cooperation with the control device, generates reaction forces and movements, in response to the examining person acting on the body model, that are used to cause the body model to move by means of the drive elements when external force is applied, in such a way that the biomechanical joint properties of the natural body segment, including bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, skin, menisci and joint capsules, are simulated and are sensed by the examining person as a biomechanical property of the respective natural body segment, wherein the representation of a haptic interaction is based on an admittance control architecture or an impedance control architecture. 2. The joint simulator according to claim 1, further characterized in that an optical display device, which is connected to the control device by signal technology, is provided, which shows the examining person a visual representation of a respective natural body segment during the activity on the body model. 3. The joint simulator according to claim 2, further characterized in that the optic display device displays suggestions and additional information. 4. The joint simulator according to one of the preceding claims, further characterized in that an acoustic generator connected by signal technology to the control device is provided for the generation of typical noises, which can occur during the examination of the respective natural body segment. 5. The joint simulator according to claim 4, further characterized in that the acoustic generators are integrated into body model.
