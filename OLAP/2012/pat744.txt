A blind fastener installation tool comprises a structural housing which features a mechanism for securing a fastener installation assembly in position relative to the structural housing during the blind installation of a fastener; and a mechanism for reciprocating the fastener installation assembly relative to the structural housing at the conclusion of blind installation. The blind fastener installation tool also comprises a fastener installation assembly. This assembly comprises (1) a pull rod assembly comprising a mechanism for pulling a first portion of a fastener; (2) an annular, piston-actuated, piston-decoupled pull rod actuation assembly to translate the pull rod assembly; and (3) a nose assembly comprising a fastener receptacle for securing the position of a fastener; and one or more optional pull rod translation dampening assemblies to smoothly and effectually dampen the sudden translation of said pull rod assembly after pintail break.
Claims I claim: 1. A fastener installation tool comprising: (a) a structural housing comprising: (1) means for securing a fastener installation assembly in position relative to said structural housing during installation; (2) means for reciprocating said fastener installation assembly relative to said structural housing at the conclusion of installation; and (3) an annular, piston-actuated, piston-decoupled pull rod actuation assembly to translate a pull rod assembly relative to said fastener installation assembly when said fastener installation assembly is secured at a fastener installation assembly fastener installation position; and (b) a fastener installation assembly, said fastener installation assembly comprising: (1) said pull rod assembly, said pull rod assembly comprising means for fastener pulling; and (2) a nose assembly comprising a fastener receptacle. 2. The fastener installation tool of claim 1 wherein said nose assembly further comprises one or more pull rod translation dampening assemblies to smoothly and effectually dampen sudden translation of said pull rod assembly. 3. The fastener installation tool of claim 2 wherein said structural housing further comprises a means for inter-connecting with a fastener delivery assembly; and wherein said fastener installation tool further comprises said fastener delivery assembly, said fastener delivery assembly comprising a clip-fed fastener delivery system, said clip-fed fastener delivery system comprising means for securing sequential oriented placement of a series of fasteners, said series of fasteners housed within a portable housing, within one or more fastener presenters, said one or more fastener presenters securely presenting each fastener in succession to said fastener receptacle as the fastener installation assembly is reciprocated and prior to said fastener installation assembly arriving at said fastener installation assembly fastener installation position. 4. The fastener installation tool of claim 2 wherein said structural housing further comprises a means for inter-connecting with a fastener delivery assembly; and wherein said fastener installation tool further comprises said fastener delivery assembly, said fastener delivery assembly comprising a blowline-fed fastener delivery system, said blowline-fed fastener delivery system comprising: means for securing the sequential oriented placement of a series of fasteners, said series of fasteners housed within a bulk supply receptacle, into a blowline, said blowline transporting each said fastener in succession to a catcher and thereafter to one or more fastener presenters, said one or more fastener presenters securely presenting each fastener in succession to said fastener receptacle as the fastener installation assembly is reciprocated and prior to said fastener installation assembly arriving at said fastener installation assembly fastener installation position. 5. The fastener installation tool of claim 1 wherein said structural housing further comprises a means for inter-connecting with a fastener delivery assembly; and wherein said fastener installation tool further comprises said fastener delivery assembly, said fastener delivery assembly comprising a clip-fed fastener delivery system, said clip-fed fastener delivery system comprising means for securing the sequential oriented placement of a series of fasteners, said series of fasteners housed within a portable housing, within one or more fastener presenters, said one or more fastener presenters securely presenting each fastener in succession to said fastener receptacle as the fastener installation assembly is reciprocated and prior to said fastener installation assembly arriving at said fastener installation assembly fastener installation position. 6. The fastener installation tool of claim 1 wherein said structural housing further comprises a means for inter-connecting with a fastener delivery assembly; and wherein said fastener installation tool further comprises said fastener delivery assembly, said fastener delivery assembly comprising a blowline-fed fastener delivery system, said blowline-fed fastener delivery system comprising: means for securing the sequential oriented placement of a series of fasteners, said series of fasteners housed within a bulk supply receptacle, into a blowline, said blowline transporting each said fastener in succession to a catcher and thereafter to one or more fastener presenters, said one or more fastener presenters securely presenting each fastener in succession to said fastener receptacle as the fastener installation assembly is reciprocated and prior to said fastener installation assembly arriving at said fastener installation assembly fastener installation position. 7. A fastener installation tool comprising: (a) a nose assembly comprising a fastener receptacle; (b) a pull rod assembly comprising means for fastener pulling; and (c) an annular piston-actuated piston-decoupled pull rod actuation assembly to translate said pull rod assembly relative to said nose assembly. 8. A fastener installation tool comprising: (a) a nose assembly comprising a fastener receptacle; (b) a pull rod assembly comprising means for fastener pulling; and (c) an annular piston-actuated, piston decoupled pull rod actuation assembly to translate said pull rod assembly relative to a fastener installation assembly. 9. A fastener installation tool comprising: (a) a nose assembly comprising a fastener receptacle; (b) a pull rod assembly comprising a jaw collet assembly, a pull rod attached to said jaw collet assembly, and a pull rod coupling attached to said pull rod; and (c) an annular pull rod actuation assembly comprising a piston, said piston aligned with respect to said pull rod assembly so as to drive in a decoupled fashion said pull rod coupling, so as to translate said pull rod assembly relative to said nose assembly during actuation. 10. The fastener installation tool of claim 9 wherein said piston acts in compression during said drive of said pull rod coupling.
