The illustrative embodiments provide a method for processing sensor data and controlling the movement of a vehicle. In one illustrative embodiment, a vehicle having a plurality of sensors attempts to receive sensor data. In response to an inability of the vehicle to obtain needed sensor data, collected sensor data is requested from a plurality of other vehicles to form alternate sensor data. The alternate sensor data is received and the vehicle is controlled using the alternate sensor data. In another illustrative embodiment, a request is received at a first vehicle for sensor data from a different vehicle. Sensor data is collected from a plurality of sensors at the first vehicle. The sensor data is then sent to the different vehicle.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for managing sensor data for a plurality of vehicles, the method comprising: receiving a request, at a first vehicle, for sensor data from a different vehicle; collecting the sensor data from a plurality of sensors at the first vehicle; and sending the sensor data to the different vehicle. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises a plurality of redundant sensors. 3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a request, at the first vehicle, for information from the different vehicle; and sending the information to the different vehicle. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the information is from an online knowledge base.
