Methods and systems are provided for a systematic approach to computer aided inventing. In a modeling environment, a model representing any item, composition or process can be defined and configured using the lexicon and specification of an innovation database. In the model, objects can be identified, defined, and configured to provide the model with constituent products, components, features and materials. An innovation engine automatically applies one or more morphs from the innovation database to the objects of the model to generate morphed versions of the model that may provide innovations of or invention to the item, composition or process represented by the model.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A device-readable non-transitory medium holding device-readable instructions for a method of aiding in the process of inventing, the method comprising the steps of: inputting a baseline entity by defining one or more objects, materials and, optionally, configurations that make up said baseline entity, wherein said defining is achieved by selecting each of said one or more objects, materials and configurations from one or more databases, said databases including a plurality of objects, materials and configurations, independently applying one or more morphs to one or more of said objects, materials and configurations to produce one or more morphed baseline entities, the morphs selected from a database comprising a plurality of morphs; optionally applying morphs to one or more of the objects, materials and configurations of one or more of the produced morphed baseline entities to produce additional morphed baseline entities; and generating a specific embodiments database comprising all of the morphed baseline entities and additional morphed baseline entities produced, wherein said databases including a plurality of objects, materials, configurations and morphs are hierarchical and wherein at least one of the objects, material, morphs, or configurations available for defining or application to at least a portion of a baseline entity is temporarily reduced in number by filter criterion inputted by a user. 2. The medium of claim 1 wherein the filter criterion is based on at least two of criteria for cost, consumer appeal, and novelty. 3. A device-readable non-transitory medium holding device-readable instructions for a method of aiding in the process of inventing, the method comprising the steps of: inputting a baseline entity by defining one or more objects, materials and, optionally, configurations that make up said baseline entity, wherein said defining is achieved by selecting each of said one or more objects, materials and configurations from one or more databases, said databases including a plurality of objects, materials and configurations, independently applying one or more morphs to one or more of said objects, materials and configurations to produce one or more morphed baseline entities, the morphs selected from a database comprising a plurality of morphs; optionally applying morphs to one or more of the objects, materials and configurations of one or more of the produced morphed baseline entities to produce additional morphed baseline entities; and generating a specific embodiments database comprising all of the morphed baseline entities and additional morphed baseline entities produced, wherein said databases including a plurality of objects, materials, configurations and morphs are hierarchical and wherein the selected morph to apply is a quantitative morph, wherein the range and increments of said quantitative morph can be specified by a user, and wherein each increment of the range generates a corresponding morphed baseline entity that becomes a record in the specific embodiments database. 4. A device-readable non-transitory medium holding device-readable instructions for a method of aiding in the process of inventing, the method comprising the steps of: inputting a baseline entity by defining one or more objects, materials and, optionally, configurations that make up said baseline entity, wherein said defining is achieved by selecting each of said one or more objects, materials and configurations from one or more databases, said databases including a plurality of objects, materials and configurations, independently applying one or more morphs to one or more of said objects, materials and configurations to produce one or more morphed baseline entities, the morphs selected from a database comprising a plurality of morphs; optionally applying morphs to one or more of the objects, materials and configurations of one or more of the produced morphed baseline entities to produce additional morphed baseline entities; and generating a specific embodiments database comprising all of the morphed baseline entities and additional morphed baseline entities produced, wherein said databases including a plurality of objects, materials, configurations and morphs are hierarchical and wherein multiple objects, materials, morphs, or configurations can be simultaneously selected by the user for application to the baseline entity. 5. A device-readable non-transitory medium holding device-readable instructions for a method of aiding in the process of inventing, the method comprising the steps of: inputting a baseline entity by defining one or more objects, materials and, optionally, configurations that make up said baseline entity, wherein said defining is achieved by selecting each of said one or more objects, materials and configurations from one or more databases, said databases including a plurality of objects, materials and configurations, independently applying one or more morphs to one or more of said objects, materials and configurations to produce one or more morphed baseline entities, the morphs selected from a database comprising a plurality of morphs; optionally applying morphs to one or more of the objects, materials and configurations of one or more of the produced morphed baseline entities to produce additional morphed baseline entities; and generating a specific embodiments database comprising all of the morphed baseline entities and additional morphed baseline entities produced, wherein said databases including a plurality of objects, materials, configurations and morphs are hierarchical and wherein each of said databases can be expanded by at least one of user input and importation from other databases. 6. A device-readable non-transitory medium holding device-readable instructions for a method of aiding in the process of inventing, the method comprising the steps of: inputting a baseline entity by defining one or more objects, materials and, optionally, configurations that make up said baseline entity, wherein said defining is achieved by selecting each of said one or more objects, materials and configurations from one or more databases, said databases including a plurality of objects, materials and configurations, independently applying one or more morphs to one or more of said objects, materials and configurations to produce one or more morphed baseline entities, the morphs selected from a database comprising a plurality of morphs; optionally applying morphs to one or more of the objects, materials and configurations of one or more of the produced morphed baseline entities to produce additional morphed baseline entities; and generating a specific embodiments database comprising all of the morphed baseline entities and additional morphed baseline entities produced, wherein said databases including a plurality of objects, materials, configurations and morphs are hierarchical and wherein said specific embodiments database is displayable in a form selected from tabular text, two dimensional graphic, three dimensional graphic, or any combination thereof.
