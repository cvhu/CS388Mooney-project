A computerized system for a fabrication facility capable of routine placement and replacement of processing tools in at least a vertical dimension relative to each other.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A computerized system for controlling a substrate fabricator, the system comprising: a processor; a storage medium storing executable software operative with the processor for controlling processing tools in the substrate fabricator and executable on command to cause the system to: display a diagram of processing tools available in the substrate fabricator, wherein the diagram comprises a schematic representation of a handoff of a substrate by logistic robots to tool ports of at least two processing tools oriented in a vertical dimension in relation to each other and the two or more processing tools are located in a fabricator cleanspace comprising an outer boundary and an inner boundary and each of the processing tools is capable of independent operation and removable in a discrete fashion relative to other processing tools; indicate specific processes that each processing tool can perform; receive an indication of one or more specific processes to be performed on a single substrate; and transmit commands to cause robotic automation to transport the substrate to one or more appropriate processing tools and perform the specific processes on the single substrate, wherein each tool is sealed to a respective opening in at least one of the outer boundary and the inner boundary and the transmitted commands comprise: removing the substrate from a cleanspace comprising a substrate carrier into a cleanspace comprising a first tool port, performing a first process on the substrate in the first tool port; containing the substrate in the substrate carrier subsequent to the performance of the first process; transporting the substrate carrier to a second tool port; removing the substrate from the cleanspace comprising the substrate carrier into a cleanspace comprising the second tool port; and performing a second process on the substrate in the second tool port. 2. The computerized system of claim 1 wherein the system additionally: correlates the one or more specific processes with intellectual property licensing terms; and generates an indication of the licensing terms to a user. 3. The computerized system of claim 2 wherein the system records licensing fees due as result of performing the one or more specific processes, or incorporating the one or more specific circuit element designs.
