Provided are hydrolases, including lipases, saturases, palmitases and/or stearatases, and polynucleotides encoding them, and methods of making and using these polynucleotides and polypeptides. Further provided are polypeptides, e.g., enzymes, having a hydrolase activity, e.g., lipases, saturases, palmitases and/or stearatases and methods for preparing low saturate or low trans fat oils, such as low saturate or low trans fat animal or vegetable oils, e.g., soy or canola oils.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of catalyzing an interesterification reaction to produce new triacylglycerides comprising the following steps: (a) providing a composition comprising a polypeptide having a 1,3-specific palmitase activity, said polypeptide being selected from the group consisting of isolated, synthetic or recombinant polypeptides having a 1,3-specific palmitase activity and said polypeptide either i. being encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein the nucleic acid encodes at least one polypeptide having 1,3-specific palmitase activity and the polypeptide having at least one amino acid residue change recited below in Table A, or ii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and having at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A, TABLE-US-00014 TABLE A Amino Original New Acid Amino Amino Residue Acid Acid 27 G Q 45 G L 54 S H 61 D A E 62 V A G 72 R E K S T 74 F I 83 V M 96 A I 98 G L 116 E A F H L Q Q R, H140R R S S T V 117 L R, I161L 120 K L 133 S A 147 I F 151 I A G H 160 P T 172 R Q 212 S R 213 K T 214 T V N R Y 215 G A H 216 A V C L or iii. having at least 85% sequence identity to full length of SEQ ID NO:2 and comprising at least one amino acid residue modification D61A; D61E; R72E; R72K; E116A; E116Q; E116R; E116T; E116V; S133A; I151G; I151A; V163R; or D164R (b) providing a mixture of triacylglycerides and free fatty acids; (c) treating the mixture of step (b) with the polypeptide under conditions wherein the polypeptide can catalyze exchange of free fatty acids with the acyl groups of triacylglycerides, thereby producing new triacylglycerides enriched in said fatty acids. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein said mixture of step (b) comprises 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-monoleine (POP) and the new triacylglycerides of step (c) comprise one or both of 1-palmitoyl-3-stearoyl-2-monoleine (POSt) and 1,3-distearoyl-2-monoleine (StOSt). 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said new triacylglycerides of step (c) have a lower saturated fat content than said triacylglycerides of step (b). 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said new triacylglycerides of step (c) have a lower trans fat content than said triacylglycerides of step (b). 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the free fatty acid comprises stearic acid. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the free fatty acid comprises an omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid. 7. The method of claim 6, wherein the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid is .alpha.-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, or docosahexaenoic acid. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the free fatty acid comprises a polyunsaturated fatty acid. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the free fatty acid comprises a fish oil fatty acid. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the free fatty acid comprises an omega-6 unsaturated fatty acid. 11. The method of claim 10, wherein the omega-6 unsaturated fatty acid is linoleic acid, gamma-linoleic acid, eicosadienoic acid, dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, docoasdienoic acid, adrenic acid, or docosapentaenoic acid. 12. The method of claim 1, wherein the free fatty acid comprises an omega-9 unsaturated fatty acid. 13. The method of claim 12, wherein the omega-9 unsaturated fatty acid is oleic acid, eicosaenoic acid, mead acid, erucic acid, nervonic acid, or palmitoleic acid. 14. The method of claim 1, wherein the polypeptide has at least 85% sequence identity to full length SEQ ID NO:2, and has at least one amino acid residue change recited in Table A. 15.
