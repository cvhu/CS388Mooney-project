Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of inhibiting the activity of a microRNA comprising contacting a cell comprising the microRNA with a compound comprising an oligomeric compound, wherein: the oligomeric compound is at least 90% complementary to miR-155 (SEQ ID NO: 1062) or a precursor thereof; the oligomeric compound consists of 15 to 30 linked monomeric subunits; and at least one monomeric subunit is a modified nucleoside. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound is at least 95% complementary to miR-155 (SEQ ID NO: 1062) or a precursor thereof. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound is 100% complementary to miR-155 (SEQ ID NO: 1062) or a precursor thereof. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound is 100% complementary to at least an 8-nucleobase portion of miR-155 (SEQ ID NO: 1062) or a precursor thereof. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound consists of 19 to 23 linked monomeric subunits. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound consists of an oligonucleotide. 7. The method of claim 6, wherein the oligonucleotide consists of 19 to 23 linked nucleosides. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound comprises at least one modified sugar moiety. 9. The method of claim 8, wherein the modified sugar moiety is selected from 2'-F, 2'-O-methyl, 2'-O-methoxyethyl, and a bicyclic sugar moiety. 10. The method of claim 9, wherein the bicyclic sugar moiety comprises a 4'-CH.sub.2-O-2' bridge. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound comprises at least one modified internucleoside linkage. 12. The method of claim 11, wherein the modified internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. 13. The method of claim 1, wherein each internucleoside linkage of the oligomeric compound is a phosphorothioate linkage. 14. The method of claim 1, wherein each monomeric subunit comprises a modified sugar moiety. 15. The method of claim 6, wherein the oligonucleotide comprises two or more chemically distinct regions. 16. The method of claim 15, wherein each nucleoside of the two or more chemically distinct regions is independently selected from a 2'-fluoro nucleoside, a 2'-O-methyl nucleoside, a 2'-O-methoxyethyl nucleoside, a 2'-deoxynucleoside, and a bicyclic sugar nucleoside. 17. The method of claim 15, wherein each nucleoside of the two or more chemically distinct regions is independently selected from a 2'-deoxynucleoside and a bicyclic sugar nucleoside. 18. The method of claim 17, wherein the bicyclic nucleoside comprises a 4'-CH.sub.2-O-2' bridge. 19. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound comprises at least one modified nucleobase. 20. The method of claim 19, wherein the modified nucleobase is 5-methylcytosine. 21. The method of claim 1, wherein the oligomeric compound is attached to a conjugate group. 22. The method of claim 21, wherein the conjugate group is cholesterol.
