The application describes an assay for the identification of small molecule modulators of integrin CD11b/CD18 and small molecules capable of modulating activity of this receptor. For example, one such compound useful as an agonist of integrin CD11b/CD18 is the compound of Formula (I): ##STR00001## Such compounds may be used in certain embodiments for treating a disease or condition selected from inflammation, immune-related disorders, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke, neointimal thickening associated with vascular injury, bullous pemphigoid, neonatal obstructive nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease, or in other embodiments for the treatment of a disease or condition selected from immune deficiency, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), myeloperoxidase deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, hyper-IgM syndromes, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiency.
Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method of reducing inflammatory response in a patient suffering from an inflammatory disease, comprising administering to the patient an effective amount of an integrin CD11b/CD18 agonist chosen from the group consisting of ##STR00039## (compound 6) and ##STR00040## (compound 11); and decreasing the level of leukocyte influx and reducing inflammatory response.
