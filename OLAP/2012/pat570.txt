A reciprocally-cycled, externally-powered weapon may include a rotative driver connected via a crank and connecting rod to the operating group of the weapon. The connecting rod may be connected to a pinion that meshes with a translating rack and a stationary rack. The translating rack may be connected to the operating group, and the stationary rack may be fixed to the receiver of the weapon. The energy needed to fire the weapon may be supplied by an energy generator. The minimum amount of energy supplied by the energy generator may be independent of the speed of translation of the operating group and may be sufficient to reliably result in cartridge ignition, thereby providing an infinitely adjustable firing rate.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A reciprocally-cycled, externally-powered weapon, comprising: a rotative driver connected to one end of a crank; a connecting rod connected at a first end to another end of the crank; a weapon operating group subassembly connected to a second end of the connecting rod; and a receiver, the weapon operating group subassembly being disposed in the receiver, further comprising a translating rack and a stationary rack, and a pinion in meshing engagement with the translating rack and the stationary rack, the pinion being operably connected to the second end of the connecting rod, the translating rack being operably connected to the weapon operating group subassembly, and the stationary rack being fixed to the receiver, wherein the weapon operating group subassembly includes a bolt carrier fixed to the translating rack, a firing pin subassembly disposed in the bolt carrier, and a bolt subassembly disposed in the bolt carrier, wherein the bolt subassembly is rotatable with respect to the bolt carrier, wherein the bolt subassembly includes a bolt and the firing pin subassembly includes a firing pin, the bolt being rotatable with respect to the firing pin, wherein the bolt includes a rearward end having a slot formed therein and the firing pin includes an engaging member for engaging the slot in the bolt, wherein the firing pin subassembly includes a firing pin base, the firing pin being rotatable with respect to the firing pin base, wherein the firing pin subassembly includes a torsion spring for applying a rotative force on the firing pin.
