A robot arm and wrist assembly provides a plurality of movable arm sections having a tool supporting wrist at the outer end. The arm has two sections that are pivotally mounted together for movement about horizontal axes, and it can be rotated about a vertical axis. The wrist is all hydraulically operated, and provides movement about three mutually perpendicular axes which intersect at a common point. The overall assembly is light, reliable, and easily programmed for remote control. The robot arms can be controlled by external force, velocity or position sensors in a closed loop system.
