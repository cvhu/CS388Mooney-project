A device useful with robotic fabric manipulating systems for forming hemfolds in fabric panels and comprising a slotted mandrel simultaneously accommodating the entire fabric edges to be hemmed and a drive rotating said mandrel within a sheath which frictionally constrains the folded fabric being drawn from the mandrel during stitching.
Claims I claim: 1. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device for folding and delivering to the stitching point of a sewing machine one edge of a fabric panel, comprising: a mandrel rotatable about a lengthwise axis; said mandrel being formed with a fabric accommodating slot extending parallel to the lengthwise axis thereof, and having a mouth opening at one side of said mandrel; drive means for rotating said mandrel to form a fold in a fabric panel edge inserted in said mandrel slot, said drive means operatively connected to said mandrel adjacent one lengthwise extremity of said slot; said slot extending continuously to the other and free extremity of said mandrel; a sheath surrounding at least a portion of said mandrel and providing for frictional engagement of a work fabric panel interposed therebetween by the rotation of said mandrel; and means for sustaining said mandrel axis in substantial alignment with the line of stitch formation of said sewing machine during sewing of a line of stitches by said sewing machine in said folded fabric panel edge. 2. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 1 in which said sheath is formed with a fabric accommodating opening arranged parallel to said mandrel slot, and in which said drive means is adapted to impart an increment of turning movement to said mandrel during each fabric manipulating operation from a mandrel position in which said mandrel slot is arranged adjacent to and in communication with said sheath opening. 3. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 2 in which said mandrel is formed with only a single slot, in which said slot is formed with only a single opening, and in which said drive means is adapted during each fabric manipulating operation to impart one full revolution of turning movement to said mandrel beginning and terminating with said mandrel position with said slot being arranged adjacent to an in communication with said sheath opening. 4. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 2 in which said mandrel is formed with two slots, said slots opening on diametrically opposite sides of said mandrel, in which said sheath is formed with two openings arranged on diametrically opposite sides of said sheath, and in which said drive means is adapted during each fabric manipulating operation to impart one half revolution of turning movement to said mandrel shifting said mandrel slots alternately into position adjacent to and in communication with opposite ones of said sheath openings. 5. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 2 in which said mandrel slot extends for a distance lengthwise along said mandrel at least equal to that of the folded seam being formed in the fabric panel, and in which an ejector is provided for shifting a folded work fabric panel lengthwise along said mandrel to proturde beyond the free extremity thereof, said ejector comprising a fabric engaging element arranged in the space between said mandrel and said sheath adjacent the drive means connection with said mandrel, an actuator for imparting translatory motion to said fabric engaging element, and a connection between said actuator and said fabric engaging element extending through said sheath opening. 6. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 2 in combination with a work fabric supporting tray defining a work supporting surface terminating closely adjacent said fabric accommodating sheath opening and arranged in a plane intersecting said sheath opening, and a robotic work transporting device including a fabric gripping end effector, effective to transport a fabric panel onto said tray, orient said fabric panel on said tray with a fabric edge parallel to said sheath opening, and impart translatory movement to said fabric panel toward said work fabric manipulating device to introduce the entire fabric edge simultaneously into said mandrel slot. 7. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 4 in which said robotic work transporting device also includes means for imparting continued translatory movement to said fabric panel toward said work fabric manipulating device after said fabric edge has been inserted completely into said mandrel slot for a distance substantially equal to the circumference of said mandrel. 8. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 7 in which said continued translatory movement imparted to said fabric panel toward said work fabric manipulating device by said means is completed prior to operation of said drive means for rotating said mandrel. 9. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device as set forth in claim 7 in which said means for imparting continued translatory movement to said fabric panel toward said work fabric manipulating device is effected during operation of said drive means for rotating said mandrel and at a rate equal to that which the rotating mandrel wraps fabric about its periphery. 10. An automatically operable work fabric manipulating device for folding and delivering to the stitching point of a sewing machine enfolded edges of a fabric panel, comprising: a mandrel rotatable about a lengthwise axis; said mandrel being formed with a plurality of fabric accommodating slots each extending parallel to the lengthwise axis thereof, said slots each having a mouth, said mouths opening in equally spaced relation to each other circumferentially about said mandrel, drive means for rotating said mandrel to form enfolded edges of fabric panels inserted in said mandrel slots, said drive means operatively connected to said mandrel adjacent one lengthwise extremity of said slots; said slots extending continuously to the other and free extremity of said mandrel; a sheath surrounding at least a portion of said mandrel and providing for frictional engagement of work fabric panels interposed therebetween by the rotation of said mandrel; and means for sustaining said mandrel axis in substantial alignment with the line of stitch formation of said sewing machine during sewing of a line of stitches by said sewing machine in said enfolded edges of said fabric panels.
