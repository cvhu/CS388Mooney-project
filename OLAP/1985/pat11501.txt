Aliasing in detected image samples is substantially reduced by a spatial low-pass prefilter employing a diffusing surface variably spaced from an imager and situated in the path of projected image light to cause greater blurring in lower resolution regions of the imager than in higher resolution regions thereof, such that the cutoff spatial frequency varies continually in accordance with the variable resolution of the system.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. In an imaging system, the combination comprising: an imager having a spatial distribution pattern of discrete picture elements for detecting a light image projected thereon, wherein the respective sizes of said discrete picture elements in said pattern in at least one given dimension vary continually from relatively the smallest in a first region of said pattern to relatively the largest in a second region of said pattern spaced from said first region thereof, thereby to derive a corresponding spatial pattern of image samples having relatively high spatial resolution in said first region, relatively low spatial resolution in said second region and a spatial resolution that varies continually from high to low in regions of said spatial pattern in between first and second regions thereof; and a spatial frequency low-pass prefilter situated in the path of said projected light image for illuminating said imager with only the spatial frequencies of said projected image which pass through said prefilter, said prefilter being comprised of a diffusing surface in spaced relationship with respect to said pattern of picture elements of said imager with the spacing distance between said diffusing surface and each of said picture elements of said pattern increasing as a direct function of the size of that picture element, thereby to vary the spatial cutoff frequency of said prefilter in accordance with the spatial resolution of each region of image samples, whereby aliasing in the variable resolution sampled image detected by said imager is significantly reduced. 2. The combination defined in claim 1, wherein: said distribution pattern is such as to provide substantially scale-invariant image samples at least in said one given dimension; and said spacing distance in said one dimension increases as substantially a linear function of the variation in size of said discrete picture elements in said one given dimension. 3. The combination defined in claim 2, wherein: said distribution pattern in such as to provide substantially scale-invariant image samples in each of two given dimensions; and said spacing distance in each of said two given dimensions increases as substantially a linear function of the variation in size of said picture elements in that given dimension. 4. The combination defined in claim 3, wherein: said distribution pattern is a polar coordinate distribution pattern; and said diffusing surface of said prefilter comprises a conical surface having an apex, said conical surface being disposed in spaced relationship with said imager with its apex being situated in closer proximity to said first region of said imager than any other region of said imager. 5. The combination as defined in claim 2, wherein: said distribution pattern is such as to provide substantially scale-invariant image samples solely in said one given dimension; and said diffusing surface comprises a plane diffusing surface of at least one wedge-shaped member disposed in cooperative spaced relationship with said imager, said plane diffusing surface being inclined at a given angle with respect to said imager such that the spacing distance between said first region and said plane diffusing surface is less than the spacing distance between said second region and said plane surface. 6. The combination defined in claim 5, wherein: said substantially scale-invariant distribution in said one given dimension is symmetrical about a given axis of symmetry of said imager that is oriented normal to said one given dimension, said given symmetry axis dividing said imager into first and second symmetric sections disposed on opposite sides of said axis with each of said sections including (1) a first region for deriving a spatial pattern of image samples having said relatively high spatial resolution and (2) a second region for deriving a spatial pattern having said relatively low spatial resolution, said first region of each of said first and second symmetric sections being situated closer to said axis than said second region of each of said first and second sections; and said diffusing surface comprises a plane diffusing surface of each of first and second similar wedge-shaped members disposed on opposite sides of said axis, whereby said first wedge-shaped member is in cooperative spatial relationship with said first section and said second wedge-shaped member is in cooperative spatial relationship with said second section, and said plane diffusing surface of each of said first and second wedge-shaped members is inclined at a given angle with respect to said imager such that the spacing distance between the first region of that section with which that wedge-shaped member is in cooperative spatial relationship and said plane diffusing surface of that wedge-shaped member is less than the spacing distance between the second region of that section and said plane diffusing surface of that wedge-shaped member.
