A means for automatically replacing tool means on a robot arm comprising a novel automatically releasable tool means, comprising electrical control conduits communicating with said robot and, in proper circumstance, with a tool rack to signal its position and condition on said rack.
Claims What is claimed is: 1. A tool assembly apparatus for use in connection with a robot, said tool comprising (1) a robot connector subassembly permanently attached to an arm of said robot and (2) a tool; said tool assembly comprising means to automatically connect and disconnect, both mechanically and electrically, said tool from said permanently attached subassembly in response to relative movement of said tool and said robot arm, and code means positioned on said tool to communicate information specific to its identity and condition from said tool, through said robot. 2. Apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said robot and said tool assembly comprise connecting electrical connector means and wherein said tool assembly comprises motor means responsive to an electrical control signal through said robot. 3. Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said robot and said tool assembly comprise connecting electrical conduit means and wherein said tool assembly comprises code means forming means to communicate through said robot information specific to identity and condition of said tool means. 4. Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said code means is a read-only-memory device. 5. Apparatus as defined in claims 1,2, 3 or 4 wherein said tool comprises circuit means and connector means to facilitate electrical transmission information relating to the condition of said circuit from said circuit through electrical conduits in said robot connector subassembly. 6. Apparatus as defined in claim 5 wherein said tool comprises, additionally, connector means to transmit information relating to the condition of said circuit to a rack means for said tool.
